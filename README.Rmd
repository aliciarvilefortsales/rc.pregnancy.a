`pregnancy.a` is an R package with the research compendium of the project: expression of the sleep-wake cycle throughout pregnancy: a systematic quantitative literature review. The aim of `pregnancy.a` is to facilitate the research work, in addition to contributing to the reproducibility of the research.

The assemble of this package was inspired by Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger & Lincoln Mullen article ["Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)"](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986).

## Installation

`pregnancy.a` is still at the [experimental](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental) stage of development, that means that people can use the package and provide feedback, but it comes with no promises for long term stability.

You can install `pregnancy.a` from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pregnancy.a")
devtools::install_github("gipsousp/pregnancy.a", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Citation

If you use `pregnancy.a` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `pregnancy.a` citation below.

```{r}
citation("pregnancy.a")
```
