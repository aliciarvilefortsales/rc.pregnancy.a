Materials and methods: A qualitative study was designed and analyzed using case studies of different health areas of northern Portugal. The methodology used was based on semi-structured interviews with 50 pregnant women. It was done a content analysis of interviews.  Results: Based on the stories obtained through interviews, we identified the category ""reference model of family "", in which two subcategories listed was identified: “the dream of building a new family” and “the dream come true”. These results match the idea of aspirations (initial ideal) and representations (abstract ideal). The results suggest a family oriented by ideals and show a decrease in the number of children per woman. This is the result of a perception of the associated costs of this decision.  Conclusions: From the universe of aspirations centered in the desire for children, only a few women prefer a life without children. However, we identified a dissonance between the initial aspirations and the practices. It is concluded that there is a process of choice between having children, as well as the transition to parenthood as a conjugal project.","2018-04","2019-02-13 20:47:12","2019-02-13 20:47:12","","31-38","","1","17","","Horizonte sanitario","","","","","","","","es","","","SciELO México","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/hs/v17n1/2007-7459-hs-17-01-00031.pdf","Being a family; Children; Etre famille, Projet de procréation, Fertilité, Enfants; Facteurs socio-économiques; Factores socioeconomicos; Factores socioeconómicos; Familia; Fecundidad; Fecundidade; Fertility; Filhos; Hijos; Procreative project; Projeto procriativo; Proyecto de procreación; Ser família; Socioeconomic factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This reality means the crack-dependent mother requires professional help to be able to care for her newborn child.  Objective:  The purpose of the study is to identify the newborn care difficulties and facilities facing postpartum women who are dependent on crack.  Method: A qualitative study was conducted at a maternity hospital in southern Brazil, through semi-structured interviews with 18 postpartum women.  Results:  The content analysis made it possible to identify a number of difficulties; namely, abstinence from crack cocaine, no breastfeeding, lack of family support, surveillance by professionals from the Guardianship Council, lack of ability to care for the newborn, fear of hurting the newborn and financial problems. As for facilities, it was found the newborns of crack-dependent mothers cry little and are quiet and tranquil. Support from family members, neighbors and friends and financial help from the partner and the family are possible resources as well.  Conclusion:  Crack-dependent postpartum women need help to fulfill their role as newborn caregivers.

Physical, hormonal and psychological changes can be observed as weight increases progressively. These factors may predispose to a respiratory sleep disorder or exacerbate an existing sleep disorder. The scientific literature suggests a higher prevalence of snoring in pregnant women, although databases show the diagnosis code of sleep apnea in less than 1% of pregnancies. The presence of both snoring and apnea during pregnancy has been associated with some adverse outcomes discussed in this article, which seeks to sensitize physicians to consider this diagnosis during pregnancy.","2017-12","2019-02-13 20:47:17","2019-02-13 20:47:17","","69-76","","","65","","Revista de la Facultad de Medicina","","","","","","","","es","","","SciELO Colombia","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rfmun/v65s1/0120-0011-rfmun-65-s1-00069.pdf","Embarazo; Pregnancy; (MeSH); Abortion, Spontaneous; Aborto espontáneo (DeCS); Cesárea; Cesarean Section; Diabetes gestacional; Diabetes, Gestational; Pre-Eclampsia; Preeclampsia; Síndromes de la apnea del sueño; Sleep Apnea Syndromes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: Scores ≥11 in the EPDS were statistically associated with low economic status, multiparity, unplanned pregnancy, history of depression and sleep disturbance. Regarding BRAMS, women with per capita income above R$ 300.00 reais showed feelings of vigor; however, feelings of anger, depression and fatigue were shown to be associated with multiparity, unplanned pregnancy, history of depression and sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: The high percentage of women who presented depressive symptoms justifies the importance and need of care for women's mental health in the gestational and puerperal periods, since they are periods of vulnerability and transformation.","2017-12","2019-02-13 20:47:18","2019-02-13 20:47:18","","8-13","","18","","","Revista Portuguesa de Enfermagem de Saúde Mental","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Portugal","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.mec.pt/pdf/rpesm/n18/n18a02.pdf","Postpartum period; Depresión posparto; Depressão Pós-parto; Epidemiologia; Epidemiología; Epidemiology; Mental health; Período pós-parto; Periodo posparto; Postpartum depression; Salud mental; Saúde mental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research papers consulted have linked physical activity with the reduction of the number of cesareans, instrumental delivery and with a more physiological delivery. It also prevents excessive weight gain in women and decreases the risk of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. Aims: The aim of this research is to know if an exercise program of moderate character with Water Study Exercise Pregnant (SWEP) method, performed in an aquatic environment, contributes to have more favorable results in the perinatal period, both for women and baby. Material and methods: The design is a randomized clinical trial. The sample will consist of 364 pregnant women, with a total universe of 6,579 births occurred in Granada (Spain) during 2014. The sample was divided into two groups, intervention group and control group. The activity will be carried out in the water sporting facilities of the Faculty of Sports Science of the University of Granada, which have two pools suitable for our purposes: a 25-meter polyvalent pool and a 12.5-meter pool for training. Results: The exercise program designed specifically for the project called SWEP is performed from 20 to 37 weeks of gestation (SG), and it consists of three weekly sessions, with duration of 60 minutes each. Sessions will include three phases: warm-up phase, the main phase in which the exercise is divided into an aerobic phase and strength training and endurance training phase and a final phase of stretching and relaxation. The variables that will be studied are: a) Maternal: weight, BMI, blood pressure, O'Sullivan test, postpartum depression, level of self-rated health, sleep quality and perceived exertion during physical activity; b) fetal: weight, Apgar scores, head circumference and GA (Gestational age); c) peripartum: time dilation, expulsion and delivery, type of delivery, episiotomy, type of feed received by the RN and time of exclusive breastfeeding; and d) descriptive: age, occupation, education level, type of exercise done before and OF (obstetric formula). Conclusion: With aquatic moderate physical activity during pregnancy (method SWEP), we intended to improve the variables above.","2016-02","2019-02-13 20:47:25","2019-02-13 20:47:25","","156-161","","1","33","","Nutrición Hospitalaria","","","","","","","","es","","","SciELO España","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","","Embarazo; Pregnancy; Childbirth; Ejercicio físico; Medio acuático; Parto; Physical exercise; Waterways","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, our objective was to study how women experience and face the situation of pregnancy loss based on the investigation of its cognitive (perceptions and meanings) and emotional (feeling) aspects. We took a sample of 11 women being cared for in conjunct housing in a public maternity ward located in Rio de Janeiro. Verbal reports collected were analyzed according to Bardin’s methodology of content analysis. It was observed that the moment of fetal death is marked among the women by reactions of shock and denial, followed by a state of depressed mood, lack of motivation, low self-esteem, and fear of further losses.

The objectives of this study were to analyze the risk factors associated with gestational diabetes and to verify if exist an association between the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes and the quality of the sleep and/or daytime sleepiness. Material and methods: case-controls study with a sample of 130 pregnant women, 46 of them with gestational diabetes and 84 controls. Anthropometric parameters such as weight, stature, body mass index (BMI) and abdominal perimeter were evaluated. Socio-demographic variables, including age and family situation were assessed, and a gynecological study was performed, evaluating the number of simple or multiple births, number of miscarriages and gynecological pathology during the past 3 years. The O'Sullivan test was conducted for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The quality of sleep and daytime sleepiness were also measured. Results: 46 women were diagnosed of gestational diabetes. There are significant differences (p < 0.001) in BMI scores among women with gestational diabetes and controls, being the highest values in the diabetic group. There is a significant association (p = 0.002) between the existence of family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes present a significant worse quality of sleep (p < 0.001), and values of daytime sleepiness higher than the general population. Conclusions: high values of BMI or family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be factors associated to the risk of suffer gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes have a poorer quality of sleep and a higher degree of daytime sleepiness than the general population, reducing the well-being of the mother and the fetus.","2015-09","2019-02-13 20:47:33","2019-02-13 20:47:33","","1139-1144","","3","32","","Nutrición Hospitalaria","","","","","","","","es","","","SciELO España","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://scielo.isciii.es/pdf/nh/v32n3/24originalsindromemetabolico06.pdf","Diabetes gestacional; Trastornos del sueño; Calidad del sueño; Gestational diabetes; Sleep disorders; Sleep quality; Somnolence; Somnolencia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample is purposive and composed of six participants. Data were obtained using open interviews and analysed based on Loureiro's (2002; 2006) proposal. Both contextual reliability and transferability were ensured. Results: The essence of the phenomenon is the shattering of a dream that results from the sudden deprivation of a desired pregnancy and motherhood. The structure found is divided into three central themes: experience of negative feelings; inner elaboration; desire to ensure motherhood. These themes coexist over time, although they manifest themselves differently. Conclusion: SA is an early pregnancy loss which brings about significant negative emotions and an effort of personal reorganisation, thus requiring attention and supervision by the healthcare professionals.","2015-06-30","2019-02-13 20:47:36","2019-02-13 20:47:36","","109-117","","5","serIV","","Revista de Enfermagem Referência","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Portugal","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.mec.pt/pdf/ref/vserivn5/serIVn5a13.pdf","spontaneous abortion; aborto espontáneo; aborto espontâneo; enfermagem obstétrica; enfermería de la obstetricia; grief; luto; obstetric nursing; perda gestacional; pérdida gestacional; pregnancy loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies performed during the past decade indicate that the circadian timing system develops prenatally and the suprachias-matic nucleus, considered the site of the circadian clock, is present by midgestation in primates. Recent evidence also shows that the circadian system of primate infants is responsive to light since very early stages of development and that low-intensity lighting can regulate the developing clock. After birth, there is progressive maturation of the circadian system outputs, with pronounced rhythms on sleep-wake phenomena and hormone secretion; showing the importance of photic regulation on infants. Thus, exposure of premature infants to light/dark cycles results in the fast establishment of rest-activity patterns, which are in phase with the light-dark cycle. The continual study of circadian system development and its influence on human physiology and illness, it is foreseen that the application of circadian biology will become increasingly important for neonatal care.","2013-06","2019-02-13 20:47:58","2019-02-13 20:47:58","","26-35","","3","56","","Revista de la Facultad de Medicina (México)","","","","","","","","es","","","SciELO México","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/facmed/v56n3/v56n3a5.pdf","human; infant; circadian rhythms; lactantes; núcleos humanos; Ritmos circadianos; suprachiasmatic nuclei; supraquiasmático","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Material and methods: Investigator-initiated, prospective multicenter study, open-label, uncontrolled conducted in 10 pain units from Catalonia hospitals. Pregabalin was consecutively prescribed at the physicians' discretion to avoid selective bias. Inclusion criteria were: outpatient, age >18 years, admission diagnosis as ""neuropathic pain"" and informed consent. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or cognitive disorders. Protocol scheduled five study visits: at baseline, 15 days, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months of treatment. Titration of pregabalin doses was pre-specified. We recorded: age, sex, type of neuropathic pain (pure or mixed), VAS (baseline, 15 days, 1 month, 2 and 3 months), MOS sleep scale (baseline and third month), concomitant drug treatment and adverse effects episodes. Patients were divided into three groups: pregabalin + NSAID + tricyclic antidepressants (NSAID+TCA), pregabalin + NSAID + anxiolytics (NSAID+ANX), pregabalin + NSAID + opioids (NSAID+OPI). A parametric Student's t test and non-parametric Wilcoxon test for paired data of quantitative variables were performed. Results: 578 patients were recruited and 472 (81.66%) completed the study. 98.8% of patients were treated with politherapy. Pain relief: mean reduction by -3.6 (± 1.9) (p < 0.0001) points. By type of pain: mixed pain -3.7 (± 1.7) (p < 0.0001); pure neuropathic pain -3.4 (± 2.2) (p < 0.0001).

Material and Methods: We conducted a cross sectional and descriptive study during September and October of 2004. 295 volunteers of a total of 304 were included. We used three validated questionnaires: Snoring questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Sleeping Quality Test. Additionally, we used the Kushida’s Morphometric Model. Results: The average age was 25,9 ± 1,67 years old with an average gestational age of 39,3 ± 1,55 weeks. We found 44,7% patients with snoring during the third trimester; the frequency of habitual snoring was 10,5%. 23,7% of patients reported having somnolence. Only 0,7% of patients had a positive result in the Kushida’s morphometric model. There was an increased risk of having habitual snoring in patients older than 25 years old. Finally, 13,6% had Pregnancy Induced Hypertension with a 22,5% of them having habitual snoring. Those with habitual snoring had 3 times higher risk of having pregnancy induced hypertension.

PNC is the recommended strategy for the early detection risks during pregnancy, establishing suitable management, preventing complications and preparing pregnant females for birth and parenting. However, not all pregnant women have access to PNC for different reasons, these being mostly beyond their control. The barriers to and reasons for failure to adhere to PNC must thus be known to ensure that the dream of safe motherhood becomes real.","2009-06","2019-02-13 20:48:08","2019-02-13 20:48:08","","165-170","","2","60","","Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecología","","","","","","","","es","","","SciELO Colombia","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rcog/v60n2/v60n2a07.pdf","accesibilidad a los servicios de salud; acceso y evaluación; access and assessment; accessibility to health services; atención a la salud; calidad de la atención de salud; health care; mujeres embarazadas; pregnant women; quality of health care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ca2+-dependent release, iv. postsynaptic actions mediated by receptors, v. an elimination mechanism at synapse. Since 1964, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was included as a neurotransmitter and is part of a set of neurotransmitters named biogenic amines. In rodents, the 5-hydroxytryptaminergic system is constituted by nine nuclei at brainstem, and divided in two groups, rostral and caudal by ther localization. The rostral group projects mainly to the telencephalon and diencephalon, while the caudal group does it to the spinal cord. 5-HT innervation to brainstem and cerebellar nuclei have been also described. The most well-known function of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the CNS is neuromodulation, in processes such as memory, learning, mood, sleep-wake cycle; all of these are regulated by this biogenic amine through a wide family of receptors. All the receptors are metabotropic with the sole exception of 5-HT1, which is an ionotropic receptor. The 5-HT system differentiates early in ontogenesis; 5-HT immunoreactive neurons are evident in rat fetuses at embryonic day 12 (E12), when almost any other neuronal lineage possesses a cellular commitment. This fact highlights the importance 5-HT has at neurodevelopment. Scientific works are focused in the 5-HT auto-regulatory signalling for neuropil outgrowth at ontogeny, another remarkable trait of the 5-HT system. In addition, 5-HT releases astrocyte neurotrophic factor S-100 beta, necessary for dendritic maintenance. The 5-HT set point at different stages during ontogeny remains unknown. Several target structures of the 5-HT system are dependent on the level of 5-HT activity in newborn rodents; e.g. the somatosensory cortex where proper barrel field arrangement requires an active 5-HT innervation. Moreover, besides the 5-HT level, other factors, such as the level of reelin, are determinant for the proper cytoarchitectonic organization of the neocortex. The use of 5-methoxytryptamine, an unespecific 5-HT agonist, in the prenatal period, which negatively affects the reelin level, leads to cytoarchitectonic derangement, as it has been described to occur in the presubicular cortex. 5-HT and plasticity are also related to neurogenesis in adulthood. Neurogenesis in adulthood is influenced by several factors. Some of them, such as exercise and an enriched environment, increase the rate of newly born neurons in the dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb; while others, such as mood depression (in humans), low 5-HT levels, 5-HT1A receptor blockade by antagonists, or down-regulation, account for a poor neurogenesis rate. Chronic administration of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, increases the number of bromodeoxiuridine- labelled (BrdU) granule cells at the dentate gyrus and hilus versus control rats. This means that fluoxetine increases the neurogenesis rate. Newly born granule cells at dentate gyrus are more likely to survive, thus contributing to maintaining the hippocampal volume unchanged. On the contrary, following chronic 5-HT antagonist administration, specifically 5-HT1A receptor blockade BrdU-labelled granule cells in dentate gyrus are 30% reduced. Reduced hippocampal volume develops in humans affected by major depression, concomitant in some cases with a decrease in 5-HT neurotransmiter level. Recent studies linking 5-HT neurogenesis stimulation in dentate gyrus explain why plastic phenomena associated to pathology could be reversed by 5-HT reuptake inhibitors like fluoxetine. These works contribute to a better understanding of both depression etiology and clinical approach.","2006-06","2019-02-13 20:48:13","2019-02-13 20:48:13","","18-23","","3","29","","Salud mental","","","","","","","","en","","","SciELO México","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/sm/v29n3/0185-3325-sm-29-03-18.pdf","fluoxetine; 5-Hidroxitriptamina; 5-Hydroxytrypamine; BrdU; fluoxetina; neurodesarrollo; neurodevelopment; neurogenesis; neurogénesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results show that pregnant and puerperal women think that maternity would be complete if they could breastfeed. They said that the fact they cannot breastfeed brings guilt, frustration, suffering, unfulfilled wishes, impotence and destroyed dreams.

Prevalence is higher in women and elder people. Around 10% to 19% of patients with insomnia remark its chronic condition. Sleep disorders in elderly patiens are associated with chronic afection, that is to say they are non lifetime dependent. Primary chronic insomnia is associated with emotional factors or stress, that might prevent sleep. Primary insomnia do neither depend on medical nor psychiatric condition. Secondary chronic insomnia may depend on an associated sleep disorder, psychiatric or medical condition, drugs and drugdependence. More frequent causes of insomnia are psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression), neurologic disorders (Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, stroke, migraine), medical disorders (cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, rheumatic, neoplasic). Sleep disorders have also been described during pregnancy and menopause. Many medical drugs (metilxantine, antidepressive and antihypertensive agents, antiepileptic durgs, corticosteroids) and nicotine may sometimes produce severe insomnia.","2002-05","2019-02-13 20:48:22","2019-02-13 20:48:22","","14-26","","1","18","","Revista Médica del Uruguay","","","","","","","","es","","","SciELO Uruguay","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.edu.uy/pdf/rmu/v18n1/v18n1a03.pdf","INCIDENCIA.; TRASTORNOS DE LA INICIACION Y MANTENCION DEL SUEÑO; TRASTORNOS DEL SUEÑO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plant is situated in a suburb of Monterrey, which is the third most populous city in Mexico and the second most industrialized. A cross-sectional study design was used for the investigation, which was carried out from September 1994 to November 1994.

A specially trained psychology student administered a questionnaire to an adult member of each family, soliciting data on the presence of acute and chronic infections, complications of pregnancy, and congenital diseases among the family members. One hundred twenty-seven questionnaires were administered in the exposed population, yielding information on 596 individuals. In the unexposed population, 147 questionnaires were administered furnishing data on 743 individuals. The sex and age distributions of the two populations were similar. The unexposed population had a slightly longer average duration of residence.
