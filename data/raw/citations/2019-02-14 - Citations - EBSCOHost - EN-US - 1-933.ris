AB  - OBJECTIVES: Blunted nocturnal dip of blood pressure (BP) and reversed circadian rhythm have been described in preeclampsia (PE). Non-dipper status and preeclampsia are both associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. Complete recovery of BP in PE is reported to occur over a variable period of time. Twenty-four hours-ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in the post-partum follow-up after a PE has not been described. The aim of this study was to assess 24h-ambulatory blood pressure pattern after a PE and to determine the prevalence of non-dipper status, nocturnal hypertension, white coat hypertension and masked hypertension. METHODS: This is an observational, prospective study on women who suffered from a preeclampsia. A 24h-ABPM was done 6 weeks post-partum at the Hypertension Unit of the University Hospitals of Geneva, concomitantly with a clinical and biological evaluation. RESULTS: Forty-five women were included in a preliminary analysis. Mean age was 33±6years, 57.3% were Caucasian, mean BMI before pregnancy was 24±5kg/m(2). Office and ambulatory BP are shown in Table 1. Prevalence of nocturnal hypertension was high and half of the women had no nocturnal dipping. The diagnosis of hypertension based on office BP was discordant with the diagnosis based on ABPM in 25% of women. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of increased nighttime BP and abnormal BP pattern is high at 6weeks post-partum in preeclamptic women. Early assessment of BP with ABPM after preeclampsia allows an early identification of women with persistent circadian abnormalities who might be at increased risk. It also provides a more accurate assessment than office BP. DISCLOSURES: A. Ditisheim: None. B. Ponte: None. G. Wuerzner: None. M. Burnier: None. M. Boulvain: None. A. Pechère-Bertschi: None.

T2  - Pregnancy Hypertension
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a symptom of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Several studies have found that SDB during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy induced hypertension. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between self-reported snoring and neck circumference, weight gain and BMI. METHODS: 2306 pregnant women answered a questionnaire which included 'Do you snore?' among the questions. The women were asked their pre pregnancy weight, current height and weight were used to calculate BMI and change in BMI from pre pregnancy to trial entry, neck circumference was measured, and the Epworth questionnaire for daytime sleepiness was administered. The data from women who answered 'Yes' to the snoring question were compared to that of women who answered No. RESULTS: Pre pregnancy BMI, current BMI and the increase in BMI from pre- pregnancy to current were all highly significantly increased in the women who reported snoring during pregnancy (p<0.0001, <0.0001 and 0.003, respectively). The Epworth sleepiness score, calculated from the Epworth questionnaire, was significantly higher i.e. more daytime sleepiness, in women who reported snoring (p<0.0001) and the neck circumference measurements of women who reported snoring were also highly significantly higher (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Women who report snoring during pregnancy have higher pre pregnancy and current BMI, increase their BMI more during pregnancy, have larger neck circumference and are sleepier during the day. Therefore women who intend to become, or are pregnant, should be encouraged to reduce their BMI and maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy. DISCLOSURES: A.J. Robertson: None. P. Johnson: None.

T2  - Pregnancy Hypertension
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Women with a history of preeclampsia have an increased risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD). Why only some women are affected by CVD after severe preeclampsia is not known. The objective of this study was to examine the presence of CVD among women after severe preeclampsia, and illuminate any differences between the women with present CVD and women without CVD. METHODS: Women admitted to Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden with the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia (O141 A, B, C and X) in 1999-2001 were invited to participate. Out of 60 women where the diagnosis was correct, 36 women agreed to participate. Blood pressure, lipids waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) were registered. Participants filled in a form concerning family history, diseases, tobacco, reproduction, physical activity, sleeping patterns, weight change, and marital stress. Family history of CVD was defined as having one first degree relative with stroke, myocardial infarct, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease or diabetes type 2 before the age of 55 (men) and 65 (women). Stress in relation was measured with Stockholm Marital Stress Scale (SMSS) and sleep with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). RESULTS: Ten women were already affected by CVD and 26 were not. Affected women had significantly higher systolic (p=0.001) and diastolic (p=0.001) blood pressure (in spite of medication), BMI (p=0.022) and waist circumference (p=0.003) as well as higher levels of apoB (p=0.017) and lower levels of apoA1 (p=0.015). A difference was also seen in family history of CVD, number of preeclamptic pregnancies, sleep and marital stress but results were not significantly different in this small pilot study. CONCLUSIONS: Constitutional differences when becoming pregnant, number of preeclamptic episodes, obesity, as well as lifestyle may all influence the risk for later CVD. DISCLOSURES: E.G.

T2  - Pregnancy Hypertension
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common in women and reported at 14-45% in pregnancy. SDB is identified by snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by repetitive hypoxia, and has been found to be associated with hypertension, stroke, and heart attack. There is no depth of knowledge examining the association between SDB and pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of self-reported snoring in pregnancy and the potential association between self-reported snoring and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) within a larger cohort from a prevalence of SDB in pregnancy study. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to women attending an outpatient's antenatal clinic. Objective measurements were undertaken. The self-reported snoring is a component of the Epworth scale. Overnight recordings of sleep were attained using SonoMat[TM] (Home Sleep Testing). Pregnancy progression and outcome data were collected on all participants and analysed by IBM SPSS v.20[TM] utilizing chi-square analysis, student T test and logistic regression analysis. HDP diagnoses were in alignment with the SOMANZ (2009) criteria. RESULTS: Questionnaires were administered and outcomes collected on 2309 pregnancies. Snoring was reported in 45.5% of women. Objective measures were attended on 202 women, snoring was recorded at 61%. HDP affected 10.1% of the cohort, 3.3% of whom had preeclampsia. Of the pregnancies affected by self-reported snoring, HDP occurred in 13.4% in comparison to 7.6% of those who do not report snoring (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This indicates an association between self-reported snoring and HDP. Further analysis will be undertaken to model the effect of other potential cofounders such as maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI and other co-morbidities. DISCLOSURES: A.J. Robertson: None. P.

T2  - Pregnancy Hypertension
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Snoring is common during pregnancy, particularly in the last trimester. Most investigators of snoring during pregnancy had utilized questionnaires to determine the presence and severity of snoring. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of questionnaires to determine the presence of snoring in pregnant women compared with objectively measured snoring. METHODS: Berlin questionnaires were administered to 202 pregnant women. One question asked 'Do you snore?' Snoring was then recorded in the woman's home using a SonoMat[TM] device, a thin mattress in which sensors measure and record sound and movement. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was determined. The results from the questionnaire were compared to recorded snoring and AHI results. RESULTS: 124 women answered 'Yes' to the question 'Do you snore?' and 78 women answered 'No' and 'I don't know' for score purpose were included in 'No'. The average gestation was 28 ± 7 weeks. Women who reported 'No' were just as likely to report >20% snoring as those who reported 'Yes' (35.5%, p=ns). CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that questionnaire results are not always a reliable method of determining whether snoring is present, and overnight monitoring should be used to rule out sleep disordered breathing. .

TI  - [Commentary on] Infant sleeping position and the risk of sudden infant death syndrome in California, 1997-2000.
AU  - Cefalo RC
T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - The widely accepted association of the prone sleeping position with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rests largely on studies that were conducted outside the United States where there are different populations and cultural practices. For this reason, the authors carried out a population-based case-control study in 11 California counties with ethnically diverse residents. Experienced interviewers spoke in person during a 3-year period in 1997-2000 with the mothers of 185 SIDS cases and 312 randomly selected control subjects. The groups were matched for race/ethnicity and age. The interviewers were trained in grief counseling related specifically to SIDS. Mothers of SIDS cases were more likely than control mothers to be less than 25 years of age, to lack a complete college education, to be unmarried, and to have a lower income. In addition, they had more previous live births, smoked more heavily during the index pregnancy, began prenatal care later, and were likelier to have been physically abused during or after the index pregnancy. Low birth weight, premature birth, and postpartum fever all were more frequent in SIDS infants. After adjusting for known confounding factors and demographic variables, both the prone and side sleeping positions were associated with more than twice the risk of SIDS compared with infants sleeping supine (on their backs). The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were 2.6 and 2.0, respectively, for the prone and side sleeping positions. This association was evident in all racial/ethnic groups. The risk of SIDS was particularly increased for infants placed in an unstable side position and later found to be prone (AOR, 8.7). Infants who usually were placed on their backs but had last been put down in the prone or side position also had a significantly high risk of SIDS (AORs, 8.2 for the prone position and 6.9 for the side position). Infants placed in an unaccustomed prone or side sleeping position were at higher risk than those who always were placed in these positions. This experience with a culturally diverse U.S. population, which follows the 'Back to Sleep' public education campaign, indicates that more emphasis needs to be placed on avoiding an unstable side sleeping position as well as unaccustomed prone and side positions.

TI  - [Commentary on] Maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during pregnancy and newborn neurobehavior.
T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - The used of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by depressed parturients has raised concern over possible teratogenic effects on the fetus. These drugs readily cross the placental barrier, exposing the fetus to increased serotonin levels early in development. This prospective study evaluated infant neurobehavior 14 to 39 hours after birth; all were normal-birth infants. Half the mothers were taking an SSRI. The users and nonusers were matched for cigarette smoking, maternal age, and socioeconomic status. Infants were monitored for behavior, startles, and tremulousness for 1 hour between feedings. Motor activity and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded during a 15-minute sleep period. Behavioral assessment was based on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. The SSRI-exposed infants had shorter gestational ages. They exhibited more motor activity and tremulousness than did unexposed infants and had fewer rhythms in HRV. They also had fewer changes in behavioral state and fewer such states. Peak behavioral state was lower in the exposed infants. These infants also had significantly more rapid-eye-movement sleep and tended to have more spontaneous startles and sudden arousals. After adjusting for gestational age, the only significant differences were in tremulousness and measures of state and sleep organization. Adjusted mean motor activity and spectral peaks in HRV no longer differed significantly between the SSRI-exposed and nonexposed infants. These findings do not support the view that using an SSRI during pregnancy has little effect on the developing fetus. It is possible that the observed changes in motor activity, startles, and HRV are mediated by the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age.

TI  - [Commentary on] Maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood obesity.
AU  - Bowes WA Jr.
T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - This cross-sectional study in six German public health offices was undertaken after a recent cohort study suggested that maternal smoking during pregnancy might increase the risk of childhood obesity. Data on 6483 Bavarian children 5 to 7 years of age were collected in 1999-2000. A self-administered questionnaire concerning maternal smoking was used. The criterion for overweight was a body mass index (BMI) above the 90th percentile, and for obesity, a BMI greater than the 97th percentile. The study population included 3847 children whose mothers reported never having smoked; 638 whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy; and 1998 whose mothers smoked at some time but not during pregnancy.The frequency of overweight children was 8.1% in the never-smoked group, 14.1% when the mother smoked less than 10 cigarettes a day while pregnant, and 17% at a higher level of smoking. The respective figures for childhood obesity were 2.2%, 5.7%, and 8.5%. On bivariate analysis, a high BMI for either parent was the strongest predictor of overweight/obesity, followed by high birth weight and then maternal smoking during pregnancy. Other risk factors included high weight gain in the first year of life, watching TV more than 1 hour per day, snacking while watching TV, early introduction of solid foods, and giving a bottle of milk or tea with carbohydrates to encourage the infant to sleep. Eating alone also increased the risk. Adjusting for parental education lowered the risk associated with watching TV and snacking. On logistic regression analysis, maternal smoking during pregnancy remained a significant risk factor for child overweight and obesity. The respective crude odds ratios were 1.43 and 2.06.In addition to discouraging frequent TV viewing (and video game playing) by children and frequent snacking, it seems reasonable to attempt to persuade pregnant women not to smoke in the interest of their children maintaining normal body weight.

TI  - [Commentary on] Physician beliefs and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction.
AU  - Cefalo RC
T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - Since pediatricians were alerted to the need for infants to be in a safe environment when sleeping, prone sleeping has declined to less than 20%, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has declined 40%. The 'Back to Sleep' campaign emphasizes, in addition to a supine sleeping position, a safe crib, firm bedding, and avoiding overheating. Nevertheless, the drop in SIDS incidence has been leveling off in recent years. Because a further decline might be possible by altering other risk factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke before and after birth, a physician survey was carried out to clarify knowledge about SIDS and attitudes toward risk reduction. Of 3717 physicians contacted in North Carolina or Washington, DC, 835 (23%) responded. The sample included family and general practitioners, pediatricians, and obstetrician-gynecologists.Nearly 80% of the respondents correctly identified maternal smoking during pregnancy, second-hand exposure to smoke, and prone sleeping as risk factors contributing to SIDS. Only 7% of the group failed to advise a back or side sleep position, and only 5% did not recommend a firm mattress. When asked whether infants required a warmer sleep environment than adults, 26% responded positively. Pediatricians were especially likely to acknowledge the importance of a supine sleep position. A large majority of pediatricians (79%) reported routinely discussing SIDS with parents. The figure for family and general practitioners was only 56%, and for obstetrician-gynecologists, 18%. Only 35% of pediatricians and 15% of family and general practitioners, however, provided written information.Further educational efforts are needed to ensure that physicians who care for infants are aware of the several ways in which the risk of SIDS may be lowered.

TI  - [Commentary on] Randomized prospective comparative study of ursodeoxycholic acid and S-adenosyl-L-methionine in the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
AU  - Wenstrom KD
T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a condition found in fewer than 1% of pregnant women in most countries. ICP typically develops in the second half of pregnancy as the result of defective bile acid transport, which leads to the release of liver enzymes and bile acids into the maternal circulation. Itching-the commonest symptom-may interfere with sleep, but in other respects the maternal disorder is benign and does not predispose to liver failure. The fetus, however, is at increased risk of preterm birth, intrauterine demise or stillbirth, and mecomium aspiration.This study compared two drugs, given separately and in combination. Both S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) enhance the excretory function of hepatocytes, stimulate choleretic activity, and dilute toxic bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. UDCA also reduces the accumulation of bile acids in the fetus, and SAMe increases trans-sulfuration of bile acids, which increases their excretion. One or both of these drugs were given to 78 women with singleton pregnancies at less than 36 weeks' gestation who had moderate or severe ICP as evidenced by high self-reported symptom scores. One group of 25 patients received SAMe at a dose of 500 mg twice daily by slow running infusion for 12 days, followed by 500 mg daily by mouth until delivery. Another 26 women received UDCA orally in a dose of 250 mg 3 times a day. The remaining 27 women received both these treatments. The treatment groups were similar obstetrically at the outset.Although all 3 treatments resulted in improvement of maternal symptoms, more women had a favorable response to UDCA alone or in combination with SAMe than to SAMe alone. UDCA given alone or combined with SAMe resulted in greater decreases in the concentrations of bile acids and transaminases compared to SAMe alone, and a favorable response in most women (85% to UDCA alone and 89% to combined therapy). Monotherapy with SAMe did not significantly alter biochemical parameters. Only one patient, treated with UCA alone, became worse. The response was also more rapid-within 7 days of initiating treatment-with UDCA alone or in combination than in SAMe alone, but was fastest with combination therapy. However, by two weeks of therapy there was no difference between the two UDCA groups. There were no significant group differences in the duration of treatment, which ranged from 1 to 12 weeks. All treatments were well tolerated and no adverse side effects were recorded. No perinatal deaths occurred, but premature deliveries before 36 completed weeks of gestation exceeded the population average in all treatment groups. Birth weights below the 10th centile of national growth curves were, however, within the limits of the population average in all groups.UDCA, alone or combined with SAMe, appears to be an effective treatment for ICP. Antepartum and intrapartum monitoring of the fetus should be routine when severe ICP is present.

TI  - [Commentary on] Risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome among Northern Plains Indians.
AU  - Cefalo RC
T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - Infant mortality--especially postneonatal deaths occurring 1 to 12 months after birth--is increased in American Indians. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the major cause of postneonatal death, was up to recently the leading cause of infant deaths in American Indian populations. Risk factors for SIDS were sought by reviewing findings from a population-based case-control study of 33 infants who died of SIDS and 66 matched living control infants (the Aberdeen Area Infant Mortality Study). All participants were American Indians living in the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Iowa in the years 1992-1996. The study group included infants dying before 12 months of age but excluded those who died while still hospitalized after delivery.The mean age at death in the SIDS group was 109 days. Univariate analyses showed that parents of SIDS infants had fewer years of education and more often reported fewer than seven prenatal visits. More case mothers had smoked and taken alcohol just before and during pregnancy, and more of them engaged in binge drinking in the first trimester. There was no difference in the use of illicit drugs during pregnancy. Comparable numbers of infants in the case and control groups were put to sleep on their stomachs in the 2 weeks before death. Infants given two or more layers of clothing were at increased risk of SIDS. Those having fewer than three well-baby visits had a nearly 14-fold greater risk of SIDS. Breast-feeding was not a significant factor. On logistic regression analysis, periconceptional drinking remained associated with SIDS (adjusted odds ratio, 6.2). Infants who usually had two or more layers of clothing were also at increased risk, with an identical odds ratio.These findings suggest that controlling alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy could lessen the risk of SIDS in this American Indian population. Attention also should be given to infant clothing, and efforts should be made to promote regular public health nurse visits.

T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - Little is known about how women perceive the onset of labor. It is possible that the way in which labor onset is experienced influences the duration of labor and other aspects of labor dynamics. The authors administered a semistructured questionnaire to 235 women who were admitted at term in spontaneous labor. They were asked about when labor had begun, how they became aware of it, and whether and when the membranes had ruptured. Two investigators independently subdivided women's experience of labor onset into 369 sampling units corresponding to 8 predefined categories. Each unit consisted of a sentence, phrase, or expression embodying a single meaning. Interrater agreement on categorizing sampling units was 0.91. Nearly two thirds of all units related to recurrent or nonrecurring forms of pain. Most women experienced the onset of labor as regular or irregular recurring pain. Multiparous women reported recurrent pain more often than nulliparas. For most parameters, including watery fluid, gastrointestinal symptoms, and altered sleep, the number of women was identical to the number of sampling units. Sixteen women reported 22 units relating to emotional reactions. One third of women (33.6%) had membrane rupture before being admitted but only 21.6% associated it with the onset of labor. Women describe a wide range of symptoms and signs as heralding the onset of labor. No standardized experience of labor onset was found in this inquiry. A woman's perception of labor onset could well be as reliable as any surrogate measure. Rather than asking parturients about when contractions began and when they became regular, caregivers should ask them when labor began and how they knew.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus can be controlled and its complications prevented, provided clients take part in self-care actions. The objective of the present study was to identify self care deficiencies in pregnant women suffering from diabetes, and to provide inputs for their educational support. This descriptive study included 12 pregnant women cared at a diabetes and hypertension reference institution in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, in April and May, 2007. Data were collected using a semistructured interview. Analysis was based on Orem's Nursing General Theory. Self-care deficiencies were related to eating habits, physical activities, sleep and rest, and social interaction. Nurses must provide educational support to these patients, evaluate their self-care capacity, and propose actions that involve the family, as well as group activities in health services.

TI  - ‘Knowledge is power’: risk and the moral responsibilities of the expectant mother at the turn of the twentieth century.
AU  - Hallgrimsdottir, Helga Kristin
AU  - Benner, Bryan Eric
T2  - Health, Risk & Society
AB  - The notion that ‘older’ mothers experience elevated risks during pregnancy and childbirth has proliferated since the mid-twentieth century. In this article, we take the contemporary concern with age as a starting point from which to historicise and contextualise the concept of maternity risk. To this end, we examine maternal hygiene manuals (self-help guidebooks on motherhood and pregnancy) published between 1880 and 1920 in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis of these manuals indicated that pregnancy during this period was presented as a potentially dangerous affair that required constant surveillance by the self (and others) to ensure favourable pregnancy outcomes. A dominant theme that emerged from the manuals was that the expectant mother was morally responsible for mitigating a range of risk factors, including adequate exercise, sleep, fresh air, as well as for choosing an appropriate father and ensuring his health. At the same time, the manuals indicated that the failure to seek out expert advice and take up responsible practices was linked to adverse consequences for the expectant mother’s health, and her newborn’s health and moral character later in life. We conclude this article by discussing how findings from our historical data can provide an important context for understanding risk discourses around pregnancy as historically specific and culturally contingent, especially with respect to risks associated with maternal advanced age.

AU  - Lawson, Christina
T2  - Occupational & Environmental Medicine
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent studies suggest that shift workers who experience exposure to light at night could be at increased risk for adverse reproductive outcomes. METHOD: Defined by cyclical patterns of circulating hormones, the reproductive system is vulnerable to shifts in circadian rhythms, either through sleep disturbances, altered melatonin production, exposure to light at night, or some other mechanism. Several occupational groups, including health care workers, law enforcement, firefighters, and manufacturing workers are required to work night shifts. Worldwide, millions work at least one night per month. RESULTS: Research will be reviewed on shift work and reproductive outcomes, including menstrual cycle patterns, fertility, pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, and birth weight. The limitations of current research will also be discussed: is there a dose response effect from the number of years of shift work, or can the effects be reversed once shift work stops? Are there different effects from permanent night shift versus rotating shift involving nights? CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs will be identified, including the need for validation of self-reported shift work data and the mechanisms by which shift work affects reproductive health. Recommendations for shift workers and employers will be explored.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Flight attendant occupational exposures include cosmic ionising radiation and circadian disruption. We wanted to determine whether these and other occupational exposures were associated with spontaneous abortion among female flight attendants. METHOD: Female flight attendants from three US airlines in three cities were interviewed. Company records of over 1.9 million individual flights during the study period were assessed for exposure to galactic cosmic radiation, solar particle event radiation, and circadian disruption. Measures of physical job demands and other occupational factors were obtained from the interview. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for age, parity, and nonflying status. RESULTS: Among 2273 women interviewed, 840 pregnancies among 673 women met inclusion criteria. There was evidence to suggest that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion in weeks 9-13 of the first trimester (odds ratio (OR)=1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-3.20). The risk of a first trimester spontaneous abortion was significantly increased with 15 h or more of flying during home base normal sleep hours (OR=1.54; 95% CI 1.07-2.21) and with high physical job demands (OR=2.49; 95% CI 1.49-4.16). CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous abortion was associated with several flight attendant occupational exposures. This is the first report of these associations based on a quantitative assessment of distinct exposures generated from individual flight records.

TI  - A change in life as experienced by first-time fathers.
AU  - Fägerskiöld A
T2  - Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences
AB  - Research suggests that the attitude of men towards pregnancy, childbirth and child-caring is different from that of women. Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards breast-feeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.

AB  - Purpose: This study explored (a) differences in sleep quality, depression, and stress among second- and third-trimester pregnant and nonpregnant women, and (b) relationships among depression, stress, and sleep quality of pregnant women in Taiwan. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: A convenience sample of 150 second-trimester and 150 thirdtrimester pregnant women was recruited from two medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Findings: The prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score>5) was 60.0% for second- and third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0% for nonpregnant women. After controlling for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3% to 36.0%) was found in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not in nonpregnant women. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was related to stress and depression. Clinical Relevance: Evaluation for sleep quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder.

AU  - Troy NW
T2  - Clinical Nursing Research
AB  - It has been assumed that women recover from pregnancy and childbirth within 6 weeks. Recent research shows that women's fatigue levels are the same, or higher, at 6 weeks postpartum as at the time of delivery. This study determined the differences in primiparous women's fatigue and energy Levels at 6 weeks and 14 to 19 months postpartum. Determinations of how some contributing factors and outcomes of postpartum fatigue relate to each other and to fatigue and energy at 14 to 19 months postpartum were also made. Analyses revealed that women are more fatigued and less energetic at 14 to 19 months than they were at 6 weeks postpartum. Quality of sleep did not correlate with fatigue or energy. At 14 to 19 months postpartum return to full functional status is almost complete, household and infant care responsibilities being most complete. The women re experiencing mild life crises of various sorts, were somewhat depressed, were gratified in the mothering role.

AU  - Willis L
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the grief responses and physical health changes of Caucasian and African-American women following a third trimester stillbirth. Data were collected by mailed questionnaires: (a) the Demographic Data Form; (b) the Bereavement Experience Questionnaire; and (c) the Health Change Questionnaire. Subjects were 32 Caucasian and 16 African-American women who had delivered a stillborn infant between 32 and 44 weeks gestation. The two groups were compared according to obstetrical history, general health change, number of physician visits, presentation of physical health problems and somatic symptoms, drug usage, sleep problems, appetite and weight changes, exercise patterns, and grief responses following their stillbirth experience. The findings indicated that more of the Caucasian subjects were married and living with their husbands, employed and reported more years of education as compared to the African-American subjects. There were no statistically significant differences between the Caucasian and African-American subjects in their responses to grief. The two groups did not differ significantly according to reported overall health changes, physical health problems and somatic symptoms. However, the African-American women reported significantly more sleep problems, greater severity of health problems and an increase in the usage of recreational drugs. The African-American women also reported a greater percentage of changes in appetite and weight however there were no reported differences in exercise patterns between the two groups.

AB  - Background: The importance of maternal sleep and its contribution to maternal and fetal health during pregnancy is increasingly being recognised. However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy.Methods: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman's Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables.Results: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance.Conclusions: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that cannot.

AB  - Background: Being overweight constitutes a health risk, and the proportion of overweight and obese children is increasing. It has been argued that road traffic noise could be linked to adiposity through its influence on sleep and stress. Few studies, to our knowledge, have investigated whether noise and adiposity are associated. Most of them were on adults, and we are not aware of any longitudinal study using repeated measures.Objectives: The present longitudinal study investigated whether road traffic noise exposures in pregnancy (N = 6,963; obs = 22,975) or childhood (N = 6,403; obs = 14,585) were associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories in children.Methods: We obtained information on BMI and covariates from questionnaires used in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, Statistics Norway, and Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We modeled road traffic noise for the most exposed façade of children's present and historical addresses at 6 time points from pregnancy to age 8. We investigated effects on BMI trajectories using repeated measures and linear mixed models.Results: The results indicated that BMI curves depended on road traffic noise exposure during pregnancy, but not on exposure during childhood. Children in the highest decile of traffic noise exposure had increased BMI, with 0.35 kg/m more than children in the lowest decile, from birth to age 8 years.Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure to road traffic noise during pregnancy may be associated with children's BMI trajectories. Future studies should investigate this further, using anthropometric measures such as waist-hip ratio and skinfold thickness, in addition to BMI.

AB  - Background: Both short and prolonged sleep duration have been linked to impaired glucose metabolism. Sleep patterns change during pregnancy, but prospective data are limited on their relation to gestational diabetes.Objective: We sought to prospectively examine the trimester-specific (first and second trimester) association between typical sleep duration in pregnancy and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes, as well as the influence of compensatory daytime napping on this association.Study Design: In the prospective, multiracial Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort, 2581 pregnant women reported their typical sleep duration and napping frequency in the first and second trimesters. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes (n = 107; 4.1%) was based on medical records review. Adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for gestational diabetes were estimated with Poisson regression, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy body mass index, and other risk factors.Results: From the first and second trimester, sleep duration and napping frequency declined. Sleeping duration in the second but not first trimester was significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes. The association between second-trimester sleep and gestational diabetes differed by prepregnancy obesity status (P for interaction = .04). Among nonobese but not obese women, both sleeping >8-9 hours or <8-9 hours were significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes: 5-6 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-4.99); 7 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.68); or ≥10 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.67). Significant effect modification by napping frequency was also observed in the second trimester (P for interaction = .03). Significant and positive association between reduced sleep (5-7 hours) and gestational diabetes was observed among women napping rarely/never (adjusted relative risk, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.13), whereas no comparable associations were observed among women napping most/sometimes.Conclusion: Our data suggest a U-shaped association between sleep duration and gestational diabetes, and that napping and prepregnancy obesity status may modify this association.

AB  - Background: Mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment might lessen both patients' discomfort and multiple births, with their associated risks. We aimed to test the hypothesis that mild IVF treatment can achieve the same chance of a pregnancy resulting in term livebirth within 1 year compared with standard treatment, and can also reduce patients' discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and costs.Methods: We did a randomised, non-inferiority effectiveness trial. 404 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] antagonist co-treatment combined with single embryo transfer) or a standard treatment (stimulation with a GnRH agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos). Primary endpoints were proportion of cumulative pregnancies leading to term livebirth within 1 year after randomisation (with a non-inferiority threshold of -12.5%), total costs per couple up to 6 weeks after expected date of delivery, and overall discomfort for patients. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN35766970.Findings: The proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term livebirth after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment (absolute number of patients=86 for both groups). The lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI was -9.8%. The proportion of couples with multiple pregnancy outcomes was 0.5% with mild IVF treatment versus 13.1% (p<0.0001) with standard treatment, and mean total costs were 8333 euros and 10745 euros, respectively (difference 2412 euros, 95% CI 703-4131). There were no significant differences between the groups in the anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, or sleep quality of the mother.Interpretation: Over 1 year of treatment, cumulative rates of term livebirths and patients' discomfort are much the same for mild ovarian stimulation with single embryos transferred and for standard stimulation with two embryos transferred. However, a mild IVF treatment protocol can substantially reduce multiple pregnancy rates and overall costs.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the influence of analytical design on the variability of published results in studies of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: The results of a prospective case-control study, of 203 cases of SIDS, and 622 control infants are presented. All variables significant on univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model analysed in nine stages, starting with sociodemographic variables, then sequentially and cumulatively adding variables relating to pregnancy history, current pregnancy, birth, the interval from birth to the week prior to death, the last week, the last 48 hours, and the last sleep period. A ninth stage was created by adding placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period. RESULTS: As additional variables are added, previously published SIDS risk factors emerged such as social deprivation, young maternal age, > or =3 previous live births, maternal smoking and drinking, urinary tract infection in pregnancy, reduced birth weight, and the infant having an illness, regurgitation, being sweaty, or a history of crying/colic in the interval from birth to the week before death, with co-sleeping and the lack of regular soother use important in the last sleep period. As the model progressed through stages 1-9, many significant variables became non-significant (social deprivation, young maternal age, maternal smoking and drinking) and in stage 9 the addition of placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period caused > or =3 previous live births and a reduced birth weight to become significant. CONCLUSION: The variables found to be significant in a case-control study, depend on what is included in a multivariate model.

AB  - Introduction: Benzodiazepines are prescribed inappropriately in up to 40% of outpatients. The purpose of this study is to describe a collaborative team-based care model in which clinical pharmacists work with primary care providers (PCPs) to improve the safe use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and sleep disorders and to assess the preliminary results of the impact of the clinical service on patient outcomes. Methods: Adult patients were eligible if they received care from the academic primary care clinic, were prescribed a benzodiazepine chronically, and were not pregnant or managed by psychiatry. Outcomes included baseline PCP confidence and knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine use, patient symptom severity, and medication changes. Results: Twenty-five of 57 PCPs responded to the survey. PCPs reported greater confidence in diagnosing and treating generalized anxiety and panic disorders than sleep disorder and had variable knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine prescribing. Twenty-nine patients had at least 1 visit. Over 44 total patient visits, 59% resulted in the addition or optimization of a nonbenzodiazepine medication and 46% resulted in the discontinuation or optimization of a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety symptom severity scores significantly improved (−2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): −3.57 to −0.43). Conclusion: Collaborative team-based models that include clinical pharmacists in primary care can assist in optimizing high-risk benzodiazepine use. Although these findings suggest improvements in safe medication use and symptoms, additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

AB  - Objectives.- To provide a guide to the use and limitations of continuous opioid therapy (COT, or daily scheduled opioids) for refractory daily headache, based on the best available evidence and expert clinical experience. Background.- There has been a dramatic increase in opioid administration over the past 25 years, with limited evidence of efficacy for either pain reduction or increased function, and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including headache chronification. To date, there has been no consensus on headache-specific guidelines for selecting patients for COT, physician requirements, and treatment monitoring. Methods.- A multidisciplinary committee of physicians and allied health professionals with extensive experience and expertise in the administration of opioids to headache patients, undertook a review of the available evidence from the research and clinical literature (using the PubMed database for articles through December 2009) to develop headache-specific treatment recommendations. This guide reflects the opinions of its authors and is not an official document of the American Headache Society. Results.- The guide identifies factors that would qualify or disqualify the use of COT, including, determination of intractability prior to initiating COT, requisite experience of the prescriber, and requirements for a formal monitoring system to assess appropriate use, safety, efficacy, and functional impact. An appendix reviews the available evidence for efficacy of COT in chronic headache and noncancer pain, paradoxical effects (opioid-induced hyperalgesia, medication overuse headache, opioid-related reduction in triptan and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug efficacy), other adverse effects (nausea and constipation, insomnia and sleep apnea, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death, reductions in sex hormones, issues during pregnancy, neurocognitive functioning), and issues related to comorbid psychiatric disorders. Conclusions.- Only a select and very limited group (estimate of 10-20%) of refractory headache patients who meet criteria for COT respond with convincing headache reduction and functional improvement over the long-term. Conservative and empirically based guidelines will help identify those patients for whom a COT trial may be appropriate, while protecting their welfare and safety.

AB  - Objectives: Willis-Ekbom disease/restless legs syndrome (WED/RLS) is the most common sleep-related movement disorder in pregnancy. We designed a prospective longitudinal study to investigate the correlates of WED/RLS during and after pregnancy.Design: A total of 138 pregnant women with WED/RLS and a control group of 251 age-matched pregnant women were enrolled prospectively. A questionnaire was administered during a face-to-face interview at first evaluation during pregnancy and three months after delivery.Results: Among all women in the first trimester, 15.6% were diagnosed with WED/RLS, whereas 32.8% of those in the second trimester and 38.8% of those in the third trimester were diagnosed with WED/RLS (p = 0.032). In regression analysis, later gestational age [p < 0.001; odds ratio (OR) 1.054] and previous history of WED/RLS (p = 0.001; OR 2.795) were positively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS, while ferritin levels (p = 0.001; OR 0.956) were negatively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS. Ferritin levels were also negatively correlated with the International RLS Study Group severity index (p = 0.041). Forty-eight patients (34.8%) experienced WED/RLS symptomatology after delivery. The ferritin levels were lower, and the mean number of pregnancies was higher, in women with residual WED/RLS (p = 0.008).Conclusion: Our survey showed that WED/RLS was more common in the second and third trimesters. Emergence of WED/RLS during the second trimester was strongly associated with residual WED/RLS. Lower ferritin levels were associated with both WED/RLS in pregnancy and residual WED/RLS after delivery. A higher number of pregnancies were also associated with a greater likelihood of having residual WED/RLS after delivery.

AB  - Prenatal psychosocial health has been linked with health behaviors, maternal health, and birth outcomes. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a prenatal depression intervention on birth outcomes and maternal physical and psychological status at 42 days postpartum. Three hundred fifty-two high-risk pregnant women exposed to obstetric complications with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) ≥ 9 or a Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) ≥ 60 were randomly assigned to the intervention group ( n = 176) and control group ( n = 176). The intervention group underwent a six-session couple-separated psycho-educational program; the control group received the usual care. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at late pregnancy (>28 weeks), 3 days postpartum, and 42 days postpartum. The intervention group had a significantly lower cesarean rate and shorter third stage of labor ( p < .05). At 42 days after delivery, only 5.1% of participants were lost to follow-up, and the intervention group had significantly less minor and major depression, more sleep time, more satisfaction with their husband and other family members, less concern about taking care of baby, and less breast milk insufficiency than the control group ( p < .05). A prenatal psychological intervention model for high-risk pregnant women holds potential as a preventive program that addresses maternal health and birth outcomes. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IOR-15006433), (retrospectively registered).

TI  - A Retrospective Study on Infant Bed-Sharing in a Clinical Practice Population.
AU  - Norton, Patricia

T2  - Maternal & Child Health Journal
AB  - In 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations on infant sleep environment which advised against infants bed-sharing. A retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from 2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2-3 months, 4-5 months, and 6-8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only), breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant ( P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006-2007 had a decreased rate of bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002-2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P = 0.00). In light of the high rate of bed-sharing recorded at the first well-child visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education during the third trimester of pregnancy.

TI  - A review of sleep-promoting medications used in pregnancy.
AU  - Okun, Michele L
AU  - Ebert, Rebecca
AU  - Saini, Bandana
T2  - American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology
AB  - Approximately 4% of adults who have symptoms of insomnia resort to various hypnotic or sedating medications for acute symptom relief. Although typically a common practice for nonpregnant adults, this is not the case for the thousands of pregnant women who also report substantial sleep issues. Unfortunately, a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this population, scant empiric evidence regarding the appropriateness of prescribing options, and the concern of subsequent teratogenicity restricts the ability of clinicians to make informed decisions. We synthesized the current research regarding hypnotics and sedating medications used (both on- and off-label) during pregnancy and their association with adverse outcomes. Medications that we investigated included benzodiazepines, hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihistamines. Overall, the examined studies showed no correlation of increased risk of congenital malformations. However, benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may increase rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and/or small-for-gestational-age infants. The small number of studies and the small number of subjects prohibit any definitive interpretation regarding the consequences of the use of hypnotic or sedating medications in pregnancy. Additional case reports, randomized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies are needed urgently.

T2  - Sleep Medicine Reviews
AB  - Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; 15-20% of obese pregnant women have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea increases along with body mass index, age and in the presence of other co-morbidities. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea in women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities; recent studies suggest that women with obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy may be at significantly greater risk of entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension and/or of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: gestational hypertension; preeclampsia; or eclampsia. This has serious public health implications; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and are associated with a greater lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms that associated obstructive sleep apnea with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not been defined, but several pathways are scientifically plausible. In this review, we will present a comprehensive literature review of the following: the associations between obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the proposed mechanisms that may connect obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and the effectiveness of treatment at mitigating these adverse outcomes.

AB  - Background: Few studies have addressed obesity prevention among low-income families whose infants are at increased obesity risk. We tested a Facebook peer-group intervention for low-income mothers to foster behaviors promoting healthy infant growth. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 87 pregnant women (Medicaid insured, BMI ≥25 kg/m2) were randomized to the Grow2Gether intervention or text message appointment reminders. Grow2Gether participants joined a private Facebook group of 9-13 women from 2 months before delivery until infant age 9 months. A psychologist facilitated groups featuring a curriculum of weekly videos addressing feeding, sleep, parenting, and maternal well-being. Feasibility was assessed using the frequency and content of participation, and acceptability using surveys. Maternal beliefs and behaviors and infant growth were assessed at birth, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months. Differences in infant growth between study arms were explored. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using quasi-least-squares regression. Results: Eighty-eight percent (75/85) of intervention participants (42% (36/85) food insecure, 88% (75/85) black) reported the group was helpful. Participants posted 30 times/group/week on average. At 9 months, the intervention group had significant improvement in feeding behaviors (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire) compared to the control group ( p = 0.01, effect size = 0.45). Intervention group mothers were significantly less likely to pressure infants to finish food and, at age 6 months, give cereal in the bottle. Differences were not observed for other outcomes, including maternal feeding beliefs or infant weight-for-length. Conclusions: A social media peer-group intervention was engaging and significantly impacted certain feeding behaviors in families with infants at high risk of obesity.

AB  - Objective: Given the significance of sleep quality among pregnant women and its effects on the health of the fetus and the lack of sufficient studies in this field as well, the present study aimed to both identify some of the psychological factors associated with sleep quality among pregnant women and investigate the relationship between sleep quality among pregnant women and other variables, including depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, perceived social support, and marital adjustment. Materials and methods: In this descriptive-correlational study, 425 pregnant women, visiting Islamabad and Ravansar-based prenatal care centers (randomly selected from the townships of Kermanshah Province (Iran)) in 2015, were selected. To collect the required data, the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (LWSMAT), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RIS), Zimet's Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and depression, anxiety and stress scales were used. Results: The results of data analysis demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between the quality of sleep and variables like depression, anxiety, stress, perception, social support and marital adjustment. Further, the results showed that the hierarchical regression of all variables could predict 31% of the changes of sleep quality. Additionally, anxiety, depression and stress were ranked first, second and third in terms of the shares of variables in predicting the quality of sleep. Whereas, resilience, perceived social support and marital adjustment were unable to predict the quality of sleep. Conclusion: Given the results of the present study, it is suggested that the roles of the psychological factors be considered in improving the quality of sleep among pregnant women.

AU  - McMillan DE
T2  - Evidence Based Nursing
AB  - Question Does a very low calorie diet (VLCD) plus intensive lifestyle counselling improve mild obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in overweight patients? Methods Design: randomised controlled trial (RCT). Allocation: unclear allocation concealment. Blinding: blinded (outcome assessors). Follow-up period: 1 year. Setting: Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. Patients: 81 patients 18DS65 years of age (mean age 51 y, 65% men) who had a body mass index of 28DS40 kg/m2 and an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of 5DS15 events/hour. Exclusion criteria were active treatment for OSA, pregnancy, and chronic kidney, thyroid, or liver disease. Intervention: a VLCD (600DS800 kcal/d) for 12 weeks plus intensive lifestyle counselling for 1 year (n = 40) or general oral and written information about diet and exercise at baseline, 3-month, and 1-year visits (control) (n = 41). Outcomes: included mild OSA and changes in weight, AHI, Snore Outcomes Survey (SOS), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Patient follow-up: 89% (intention-to-treat analysis). Main results Fewer patients in the VLCD plus counselling group had mild OSA than in the control group (table). A VLCD plus counselling led to a greater reduction in weight and improvements in AHI and SOS scores compared with control (table); groups did not differ for ESS scores (table). Conclusion A very low calorie diet plus intensive lifestyle counselling improved mild obstructive sleep apnoea in overweight adults.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate barriers preventing pregnant women from using insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 5 years after the launch of the national malaria strategy promoting these measures in Kenya.Methods: All women aged 15-49 years were interviewed during a community survey in four districts between December 2006 and January 2007. Women pregnant in the last 12 months were asked about their age, parity, education, use of nets, ITN, antenatal care (ANC) services and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (overall and for IPT) during pregnancy. Homestead assets were recorded and used to develop a wealth index. Travel time to ANC clinics was computed using a geographic information system algorithm. Predictors of net and IPT use were defined using multivariate logistic regression.Results: Overall 68% of pregnant women used a net; 52% used an ITN; 84% attended an ANC clinic at least once and 74% at least twice. Fifty-three percent of women took at least one dose of IPT-SP, however only 22% took two or more doses. Women from the least poor homesteads (OR = 2.53, 1.36-4.68) and those who used IPT services (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.42) were more likely to sleep under any net. Women who used IPT were more likely to use ITNs (OR = 1.35, 1.03-1.77), while those who lived more than an hour from an ANC clinic were less likely (OR = 0.61, 0.46-0.81) to use ITN. Women with formal education (1.47, 1.01-2.17) and those who used ITN (OR: 1.68, 1.20-2.36) were more likely to have received at least one dose of IPT-SP.Conclusion: Although the use of ITN had increased 10-fold and the use of IPT fourfold since last measured in 2001, coverage remains low. Provider practices in the delivery of protective measures against malaria must change, supported by community awareness campaigns on the importance of mothers' use of IPT.

AU  - Thomas KA
AU  - Burr RL
T2  - MCN: The American Journal of Maternal Child Nursing
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data. RESULTS: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r > or = 0.80) when 3 days of data were used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

AB  - Objectives: To examine oxidative & nitrosative stress (O&NS) biomarkers at the end of term in relation to perinatal affective symptoms, neuro-immune biomarkers and pregnancy-related outcome variables.Methods: We measured plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), -sulfhydryl (-SH), peroxides (LOOH) and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in pregnant women with and without prenatal depression and non-pregnant controls.Results: Pregnancy is accompanied by significantly increased AOPP and NOx, and lowered TRAP, -SH and LOOH. Increased O&NS and lowered LOOH and -SH levels are associated with prenatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal symptoms). Increased AOPP and NOx are significantly associated with lowered -SH, TRAP and zinc, and with increased haptoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. Increased O&NS and lowered TRAP and PON 1 activity, at the end of term predict mother (e.g. hyperpigmentation, labor duration, caesarian section, cord length, breast milk flow) and baby (e.g. sleep and feeding problems) outcome characteristics.Conclusions: Pregnancy is accompanied by interrelated signs of O&NS, lowered antioxidant defenses and activated neuro-immune pathways. Increased O&NS at the end of term is associated with perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms and may predict obstetric and behavioral complications in mother and baby.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of acupression at the H7 point on sleep quality during pregnancy. After oral consent had been obtained, the midwife invited the women claiming to have poor sleep quality and anxiety symptoms to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-1. Then, the same midwife, previously trained by an expert acupuncturist (I.N.), advised the women to put on the wrist overnight compression H7 Insomnia Control half an hour before going to bed and to take it off upon awakening, for 10 consecutive days and thereafter every odd day (active group). Women refusing to wear the device for low compliance toward acupression were considered as the control group. After 2 weeks, a second questionnaire evaluation was completed. In the active, but not in the control, group, a significant improvement of sleep quality was observed after H7 device application. The study suggests that H7 acupression applied for 2 weeks improves sleep quality in pregnant women. This preliminary result should serve to stimulate further studies on the long-term effects of acupression.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to test the effects of acupuncture on insomnia in a group of pregnant women under real life conditions, and to compare the results with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone (sleep hygiene). Methods: A total of 30 conventionally treated pregnant women were allocated at random Into groups with or without acupuncture. Seventeen patients formed the study group and 13 the control group. The pregnant women scored the severity of insomnia using a Numerical Rating Scale from 0 to 10. Women were followed up for eight weeks and interviewed live times, at two-week intervals. Results: Eight women dropped out. five in the study group and three in the control group. The study group reported a larger reduction on insomnia rating (5.1) than the control group (0.0), a difference which was statistically significant (P=0.0028). Average insomnia scores decreased by at least 50% over time in nine (75%) patients in the study group and in three (30%) of the control group. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that acupuncture alleviates insomnia during pregnancy and further research is justified.

T2  - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are widely practised. However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate. Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor. Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AU  - da Silva JB
T2  - Acupuncture in Medicine
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of acupuncture under real life conditions, in the treatment of emotional complaints during pregnancy. METHODS: A group of 51 conventionally treated pregnant women (with counselling by their physicians and nurses) was allocated by chance into two groups to be either treated or not by acupuncture. Both groups (28 in the study group and 23 in the control group) presented emotional complaints such as anxiety, depression and irritability. They reported the severity of symptoms using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10; and they rated how much the symptoms disturbed five aspects of their lives: mood, sleep, relationships, social activities, sexual life and joy of living. Traditional acupuncture was used. In order to facilitate protocols we used pre-programmed points. Up to four points were permitted as optional points. RESULTS: Three women from the acupuncture group and four from the control group dropped out of the study. Over the study period, the NRS scores of intensity of emotional distress decreased by at least half in 15/25 (60%) of patients in the study group and in 5/19 (26%) of those in the control group (P=0.013). The impact of the distress on three out of the five aspects of life was significantly less in the acupuncture group when compared with the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Emotional complaints are very common in pregnancy and medication is always a risk. In this study, acupuncture seems to be an efficacious means of reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life of women with emotional complaints during pregnancy. Large randomised studies are recommended to confirm these results.

TI  - Adaptation to pregnancy and motherhood: personality characteristics of primiparas age 30 years and older.
AU  - McRae MG
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of the personality characteristics of self-esteem, ego-development level, and unconscious attitudes toward pregnancy and motherhood on adaptation to pregnancy and motherhood in primiparas age 30 years and older. The conceptual framework was derived from Roy's four modes of adaptation which were operationalized to incorporate the independent and dependent variables. A descriptive correlational design was used, and instruments used in data collection included: Rosenberg's self-esteem scale, Loevinger's Washington University Sentence Completion Test (form 81), Lakin's Modified Thematic Apperception Test, Erickson's Pregnancy Symptom Checklist, and the Price Assessment of Maternal-infant Sensitivity Scale. Data were collected, using a non-random purposive sampling, over an 18 month period. The sample included 70 subjects who were scheduled to deliver at a major Boston teaching hospital. During the second trimester of pregnancy, the subjects completed the self-esteem scale, the sentence completion test, the pregnancy symptom checklist, and story writing in response to four TATs. At 12 weeks postpartum, a qualitative interview was conducted, and the maternal-infant sensitivity scale was completed during a feeding session at a scheduled home visit. The results of the study suggest a correlation between self-esteem and the physiological and psychological symptoms reported during pregnancy, and between pregnancy symptoms and postpartum maternal-infant sensitivity. Significant correlations were obtained between maternal and paternal age and the subjects' ego level, and length of marriage and TAT scores. Qualitative interview revealed positive themes of love, compassion, fulfillment in the maternal role, an unexpected 'falling in love' with their infants, and negative themes of sleep deprivation, lack of ability to prioritize activities of daily living, and concern about the marital relationship. Recommendations include replication of the study in a sample of younger primiparas, multiparous women, and a more heterogeneous group of pregnant women. Further research is indicated to investigate the significance of the Roy model on adaptation to pregnancy and motherhood. The results have nursing implications for assessment and intervention in the care of women who begin childbearing in their decade and beyond.

AB  - The article describes the risk factors for childhood obesity and the roles different groups can play in addressing obesity prevention and management. Higher pre-pregnancy weight status all have been linked with childhood obesity. Maintaining healthy dietary patterns throughout childhood is considered an important obesity prevention strategy. Shorter sleep duration is a third risk factor for obesity.

AB  - Introduction: Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for nonaffective psychosis (NAP) in the offspring, although the mechanism(s) of this association are not clear. The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the "de novo mutation" hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP.Methods: Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population birth cohort.Results: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 0.99-1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a father with schizophrenia and APA.Discussion: In both a general population cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the "de novo mutation" hypothesis.

AB  - This study examined the incidence of adverse prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal experiences amongst children with anxiety disorders, and the relationship to clinical symptomology and functional impairment in treatment-seeking children (N = 107) with a primary anxiety disorder. Anxious children had higher rates of reported maternal prescription medication use during pregnancy, maternal smoking and illness during pregnancy and neonatal complications (including neonatal intensive care and feeding issues) compared with population base rates and non-affected children. Almost one-third had early problems with sleep. Developmental problems were common with more than half having at least one area of delay. More than three quarters of anxious children had a first-degree family member with a psychiatric history. There were several associations between neonatal complications and subsequent clinical symptomology, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depressive comorbidity, anxiety severity and functional impairment. Findings suggest higher rates of perinatal complications in anxious children.

AB  - Objective: Although afternoon napping is very common, particularly in China, there are limited data regarding the potential health effects of afternoon napping during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. We aimed to investigate the relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and low birth weight (LBW).Methods: A total of 10,111 women aged 15-50 years were recruited from the ongoing Healthy Baby Cohort study in China, in 2012-2014. Information on sleep habits during pregnancy was obtained by questionnaires at the time of institutional delivery. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Compared with women who reported no napping, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for LBW were 0.83 (95% CI 0.58-1.18) and 0.61 (0.44-0.83) for those who reported ≤1 h and >1 h of napping, respectively (P for trend <0.001). LBW risk reached a threshold at approximately 1.5 h of afternoon napping. The inverse relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW was stronger among women with lower educational level (P for interaction = 0.011). For frequency of afternoon napping, the multivariate analysis suggested a significant inverse association between LBW and napping 5-7 days/week (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92).Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the association between afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW risk. Our findings suggest that appropriate afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping for pregnant women might reduce the risk of LBW.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women in Japan and its associated factors. METHOD: 344 institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006. Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6% and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSION: It is important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women.

T2  - Sleep Medicine
AB  - Background: Allostatic load (AL) measures the cumulative impact of chronic stress and is associated with adverse health outcomes. A novel scoring system has previously been developed for AL in early pregnancy that is associated with pre-eclampsia. It was hypothesized that AL, as identified by the present model, is associated with psychosocial stressors and, specifically, poor sleep quality.Methods: Women were selected from a low-risk, community-dwelling study population who enrolled at <15 weeks gestation. Nine physiologic components were divided among the domains of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory function. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the association of AL with age, income, the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare AL by race and educational attainment.Results: A total of 103 women were identified, with: a mean age of 29.8 ± 5.0 years, 17.5% black, and mean gestational age 12.2 ± 1.1 weeks. Allostatic load was positively correlated with the PSQI (ρ = 0.23, p = 0.018). There were no associations with age, income, prenatal distress, race, or depression scores. College-educated women had lower AL compared with those with less education (0.57 ± 0.43 vs 0.81 ± 0.55, p = 0.045).Conclusion: Higher AL, measured by the pregnancy-specific model, was associated with poorer sleep quality and lower educational attainment, both of which were considered to be chronic stressors. These relationships were consistent with previous findings in non-pregnant populations, and suggest that AL may be useful for capturing the physiologic impact of chronic stress in early pregnancy.

AB  - Adults born preterm have higher blood pressure (BP) than those born at term. Most studies have focused on preterm birth, and few have assessed BP variability, an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. We studied the association of preterm birth with 24-hour ambulatory BP, measured by an oscillometric device, in 42 young adults born early preterm (<34 weeks), 72 born late preterm (34-36 weeks), and 103 controls (≥37 weeks). Sleep was confirmed with accelerometry in 72.4% of subjects. The 24-hour systolic BP of adults born early preterm was 5.5 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.3), awake systolic BP was 6.4 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 2.8-10.1), and sleeping systolic BP was 2.9 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval 0.3-7.5) when adjusted for age, sex, and use of accelerometry. The differences remained similar when adjusted for height, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, parental education, maternal body mass index, smoking during pregnancy, and gestational diabetes mellitus and attenuated slightly when adjusted for maternal hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Adults born early preterm also had higher BP variability as indicated by higher individual standard deviations of systolic BP and diastolic BP. Although our results were consistent with a dose-response relationship between shorter gestation and higher BP, the difference between the late preterm and term groups was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that the higher BP in adults born early preterm is present during both waking and sleeping hours, may be more pronounced during waking hours, and is accompanied by higher individual BP variability.

T2  - Music Therapy Perspectives
AB  - Background: Although an increase in research and treatment models exists for women survivors of sex trafficking (Clawson, Salomon, & Grace, 2013; Johnson, 2012), a limited literature connects the needs of survivors to music therapy treatment protocols (Schrader & Wendland, 2012). Literature on the effectiveness of music therapy with populations displaying similar symptoms (Amir, 2004; Bensimon, Amir, & Wolf, 2012) suggests that treatment involving music would potentially benefit survivors of sex trafficking. Related Literature: As victims of trafficking, the women are psychologically and physically enslaved. Once rescued, they are in desperate need of trauma-informed aftercare based on neurobiological research that appropriately treats each survivor’s complex needs (Clawson, Salomon, & Grace, 2013). In particular, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, depression, and anxiety are core problems. Objective: The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the status of music therapy with women who have been trafficked, focused in the following ways: (a) Are music therapists working with this population? (b) What are the complex needs identified in the literature? (c) How are music therapists addressing the needs identified in the literature? (d) Does treatment support a neurobiological approach? and (e) What support do music therapists need to work with this population? Methods: Based on a review of the literature, a list of 18 observed needs for the women was compiled and a 20-item questionnaire was designed and distributed via SurveyMonkey. The questions primarily involved rating scales that requested music therapists working with the population to identify information about observed needs, employed music experiences, treatment focuses, and materials they consulted or needed. Participants were sent an e-mail asking them to verify whether they were board-certified music therapists and had worked with clients who had survived trafficking. Twelve participants met the inclusion criteria, and eleven participants completed the questionnaire (91.6% return rate). Responses were analyzed using one-way within-subject ANOVAs, follow-up dependent t-tests using the modified Bonferroni correction, and Pearson r; all were evaluated at α = .05. Two questions also required coding procedures. Results: Results indicated that only a few music therapists are working with the population (n = 12); the age range is 6 to 59, with most survivors between the ages of 12 and 23. Music therapists rated 90% of the listed needs as moderately important or higher, indicating their awareness of the women’s needs. Some observed needs also were considered significantly more important within each domain, except for the cognitive domain: (a) emotion—experiencing anger and depression were significantly more important than guilt; (b) social —difficulty with attachment relationships and mistrust of others were significantly more important than identification with the trafficker; and (c) medical—disruption of sleep/eating cycles was significantly more important than pregnancy complications and physical injuries. All Cohen’s ds supported these results. No significant differences, however, existed among music therapists’ ratings of how often they use seven music experiences, F(6,54) = 1.68, p = .143, Eta2 = .16. The strong effect size suggests that differences may exist if a larger n was available. Post hoc correlations between observed needs and parallel music therapy focuses revealed eight moderately high, significant relationships at p ≤ .048: difficulty learning (r = .67), delayed development (r = .82), anger (r = .89), guilt (r = .78), depression (r = .74), identification with trafficker (r = .85), addictions (r = .87), and sleep/eating cycles (r = .69). Information most often requested by music therapists working with this population (63.5 to 72.7%) was types of trauma, counseling skills, needs of the women, and facts about sex trafficking. Conclusions: The results suggest that women survivors of sex trafficking are a population that is drastically under-represented in music therapy practice. Although music therapists appear to be aware of the needs of the population, they tend to focus their treatment on just a few of the 18 needs, especially those within the emotional and cognitive domains. Data and anecdotal comments from the respondents further suggest a desire (a) for more research (e.g., trauma-informed treatment protocol linking treatment focuses with music experiences) and training; and (b) to form a support group among the music therapists working with these women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear if it is safe for babies to bed share with adults. In Ireland 49% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases occur when the infant is bed-sharing with an adult. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of bed-sharing during the last sleep period on risk factors for SIDS in Irish infants. DESIGN: An 8 year (1994-2001) population based case control study of 287 SIDS cases and 831 controls matched for date, place of birth, and sleep period. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The risk associated with bed-sharing was three times greater for infants with low birth weight for gestation (UOR 16.28 v 4.90) and increased fourfold if the combined tog value of clothing and bedding was > or =10 (UOR 9.68 v 2.34). The unadjusted odds ratio for bed-sharing was 13.87 (95% CI 9.58 to 20.09) for infants whose mothers smoked and 2.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 4.39) for non-smokers. Age of death for bed-sharing and sofa-sharing infants (12.8 and 8.3 weeks, respectively) was less than for infants not sharing a sleep surface (21.0 weeks, p<0.001) and fewer bed-sharing cases were found prone (5% v 32%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for SIDS vary according to the infant's sleeping environment. The increased risk associated with maternal smoking, high tog value of clothing and bedding, and low z scores of weight for gestation at birth is augmented further by bed-sharing. These factors should be taken into account when considering sleeping arrangements for young infants.

TI  - An Australian study of functional status after childbirth.
AU  - McVeigh CA
T2  - Midwifery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify key predictive variables of functional status after childbirth. DESIGN: An investigative survey design. SETTING: Primary health care maternal child health centres in one large city in Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 200 mothers selected from a culturally diverse population. All were aged 20 to 35 years, had experienced normal pregnancies, labours, deliveries and delivered a healthy baby between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation. MEASURES AND FINDINGS: The Inventory of Functional Status After Childbirth (IFSAC) (Fawcett Tulman & Myers 1988) was used as the main outcome measure. Three variables predictive of functional status after childbirth were identified, namely, satisfaction with level of stamina and well-being, sleep pattern at night and perceived lack of support following childbirth. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Return to full functional status as measured by IFSAC takes longer than physiological recovery after childbirth. Women who experience diminished well-being, interrupted sleep patterns and lacked support, appeared to be at greater risk of role congestion, overload and dysfunction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: To help women avoid the additive nature of assuming the motherhood role while also resuming past role responsibilities, practitioners could encourage pregnant women to develop a postnatal support plan. Women need to be proactive in negotiating specific and ongoing support from others with household responsibilities and some aspects of baby care.

AB  - Background: Stillbirth occurring after 28 weeks gestation affects between 1.5-4.5 per 1,000 births in high-income countries. The majority of stillbirths in this setting occur in women without risk factors. In addition, many established risk factors such as nulliparity and maternal age are not amenable to modification during pregnancy. Identification of other risk factors which could be amenable to change in pregnancy should be a priority in stillbirth prevention research. Therefore, this study aimed to utilise an online survey asking women who had a stillbirth about their pregnancy in order to identify any common symptoms and experiences.Methods: A web-based survey.Results: A total of 1,714 women who had experienced a stillbirth >3 weeks prior to enrolment completed the survey. Common experiences identified were: perception of changes in fetal movement (63% of respondents), reports of a "gut instinct" that something was wrong (68%), and perceived time of death occurring overnight (56%). A quarter of participants believed that their baby's death was due to a cord issue and another 18% indicated that they did not know the reason why their baby died. In many cases (55%) the mother believed the cause of death was different to that told by clinicians.Conclusions: This study confirms the association between altered fetal movements and stillbirth and highlights novel associations that merit closer scrutiny including a maternal gut instinct that something was wrong. The potential importance of maternal sleep is highlighted by the finding of more than half the mothers believing their baby died during the night. This study supports the importance of listening to mothers' concerns and symptoms during pregnancy and highlights the need for thorough investigation of stillbirth and appropriate explanation being given to parents.

AB  - Sinus bradycardia which is a sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of less than 60 bpm is caused by intrinsic cardiac disorders like sick sinus syndrome or inferior myocardial infarction, metabolic and environmental causes (such as hypothyroidism and electrolyte disorders), medications (such as beta-blockers and amiodarone), infection (such as myocarditis), increased intracranial pressure, and toxic exposure, while it can sometimes be a normal phenomenon, especially during sleep, in athletes, and during pregnancy. Symptomatic sinus bradycardia should warrant a thorough work-up in order to identify any reversible causes; otherwise, placement of a permanent pacemaker could be needed. We present the case of a patient who was admitted due to confusion and fever and was found to have pneumococcal meningitis and bacteremia, and during his hospital stay he developed symptomatic sinus bradycardia that was of intractable cause and persistent. Placement of a permanent pacemaker was chosen until the night staff of the hospital discovered by chance the neglected cause of his bradycardia.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify how puerperae perceive experiences they will face after hospital discharge and to identify the factors related to the formation of the living images. Forty-four puerperae who had normal pregnancies responded to a questionnaire regarding their anticipated and actual experiences. A statistical analysis was performed to assess the difference between the living images of daily activities and actual experience as well as to correlate these findings with the background of the subjects.Results1. Living images after hospital discharge were close to actual experience, except for the number of baby care hours.2. For the period immediately after hospital discharge, the puerperae experiences were close to what they perceived because of the support they received from family.3. At the time of the medical examination, one month after delivery, the puerperae noted that housekeeping hours increased as they expected but baby care hours increased significantly more than they expected. Sleep and rest hours were reduced.4. The following can be considered as factors used by the puerperae in forming living images after hospital discharge : factors such as baby care experiences, the baby feeding method, and the amount and quality of support they received after discharge.

AU  - Madlala, SS

T2  - South African Journal of Clinical Nutrition
AB  - Globally, anxiety and depression is the third leading cause of disease burden for women 14 to 44 years of age. The World Health Organisation reports that 15 to 57% of women in developing countries experience symptoms of depression. Maternal mental illness has a negative impact on infant and young child (IYC) growth, development and care, having serious health implications in terms of physical, cognitive and emotional well-being during crucial stages of the life span, such as the first 1000 days and early childhood. Various studies conducted in both developed and developing countries, have shown that maternal depression is associated with negative health outcomes such as: low birth weight, developmental delay, incomplete immunisation schedules, acute or chronic diarrhoea, somatic symptoms, disrupted sleep patterns and child abuse, as well as psychiatric and neuro-behavioural disorders. In addition, maternal depression impairs IYC care practices related to breastfeeding, health care, safety and development. It also contributes to inadequate nutrition during pregnancy as well as that of offspring during infancy and childhood, resulting in suboptimal brain development and inadequate growth. Infants with depressed mothers are not only vulnerable to becoming underweight, but also being stunted.

AU  - Mellor, R.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - Research indicates that poor sleep quality is linked to and may precede depressive symptomatology in pregnancy, complicating screening for either condition. Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores of probable depression ( X 13.39; p < 0.001). Berlin-assessed risk of SDB was also associated with probable depression ( X 9.20 p < 0.01), though this was attenuated following multivariate analysis. There was a significant relationship between total PSQI score and the tendency for participants to attribute 'sleep-related causes' to their low mood ( X 20.78; p < 0.001). This study confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI).

TI  - Antenatal depression: nurses who understand the prevalence, signs and symptoms, and risk factors associated with antenatal depression (AD) can play a valuable role in identifying AD and preventing the sequelae in pregnant women and their families.
AU  - Bowen A
AU  - Muhajarine N
T2  - Canadian Nurse
AB  - About 20 per cent of pregnant women experience antenatal depression (AD), which not only has deleterious effects on the woman and her baby but also increases the risk of developing postpartum depression. Nurses who understand the prevalence, signs and symptoms, and risk factors associated with AD can help to identify it and prevent the sequelae. The signs and symptoms of depression in pregnancy do not differ from depression at any other time. However, AD may go undiagnosed because of a focus on maternal and fetal well-being and the attribution of complaints to the physical and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. Risk factors include history of depression, lack of partner, marital difficulties, lack of social support, poverty, family violence, increased life stress, substance abuse, history of previous abortions, unplanned pregnancy, ambivalence toward the pregnancy and anxiety about the fetus. Most of the standard treatments for depression can be used in pregnant women, with the exception of some antidepressant medications. Supportive therapies -- exercise, adequate nutrition, adequate sleep, and support from family and friends -- are also indicated. Screening of women with known risk factors is crucial, but the authors suggest that the high overall prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy indicates a need for universal screening.

AB  - In the United States, roughly half of women are either overweight (24.5%) or obese (21.4%) when they become pregnant. Women who are obese before pregnancy are at increased risk for a number of pregnancy complications relative to normal-weight women. Specifically, obesity is associated with significantly increased maternal risks, including gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and sleep disordered breathing. Maternal obesity is also associated with increased risks of adverse fetal outcomes, including prematurity, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and abnormal fetal growth. In this review, we will discuss the implications of obesity with respect to antepartum care.

AB  - Introduction: Nearly 40% of US women of childbearing age are obese. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with multiple risks for both the woman and fetus, yet clinicians often feel unprepared to provide optimal antepartum care for this group of women. We collected and reviewed current evidence concerning antepartum care of women who are obese during pregnancy. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines. Current evidence relating to the pregnancy care of women with a prepregnancy body mass index of 30kg/m2 or higher was identified using MEDLINE databases via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection between January 2012 and February 2018. Results: A total of 354 records were located after database searches, of which 63 met inclusion criteria. Topic areas for of included studies were: pregnancy risk and outcomes related to obesity, communication between women and health care providers, gestational weight gain and activity/diet, diabetic disorders, hypertensive disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, mental health, pregnancy imaging and measurement, late antepartum care, and preparation for labor and birth. Discussion: Midwives and other health care providers can provide better antepartum care to women who are obese during pregnancy by incorporating evidence from the most current clinical investigations.

AB  - Objective: Prenatal maternal anxiety has detrimental effects on the offspring's neurocognitive development, including impaired attentional function. Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety and antidepressant use.Method: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD=38).Results: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus.Conclusions: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the relationship of anxiety and quality of life and sleep variables to recurrent miscarriages (RMs) in patients during two stages of their treatment in an RM-dedicated clinic - before and after the evaluation - and determine what factors could aggravate anxiety and worsen global well-being outcomes. Study design: Thirty-nine women who had experienced two or more RMs were measured before and after their evaluation and investigation in the RM clinic. A battery of questionnaires including the STAI scale and various instruments were administered to record anxiety, mental, and physical components of quality of life and sleep quality. Several statistical tests including canonical correlation were performed. Results: All the patients revealed a mild to moderate level of anxiety, low numbers of physical and mental health but reasonably normal values of the global quality of sleep. The evaluation in the RM clinic and investigation for possible causes accounting for RM did not significantly change anxiety levels. The children-to-pregnancies ratio introduced into the analysis proved to correlate significantly with the sleep quality and mental health. Summarized anxiety in a given RM woman could be predicted based on the set of the variables, characterizing the woman's reproductive status and her psychological health. Conclusions: This study establishes anxiety as a common response in RM patients, and suggests factors that predict it. Knowing these factors may help clinicians to identify more accurately those RM patients who would be prone to a high level of anxiety and therefore need more attention and reassurance.

Method: This is a descriptive, retrospective study with documentary analysis of 1000 medical records and a checklist conducted from July to September 2014, at a maternity hospital in Paraiba, Brazil. It consisted of analysing descriptive measures and comparing the relationship between nursing diagnoses and interventions using NANDA – International and the Nursing Interventions Classification. Results: The most common diagnoses in labour were acute pain (62%), fatigue (24.7%), and anxiety (22%). For high-risk pregnant women they were impaired sleep and rest (100%), risk of infection (81.8%), and anxiety (77.2%). The interventions were hand washing (80.8%) and identify and accommodate patient in the bed (78%). Conclusion: The diagnoses express needs during parturition and the psychobiological changes in high-risk pregnancy. The interventions are disconnected from the diagnoses and should therefore be reviewed and altered.

AB  - Sleep quality is integral to optimal physical functioning and mental health during pregnancy. There has, however, been little work conducted to determine the most appropriate measure of sleep quality in this clinical group, a surprising observation given the complex and dynamic psychobiology of pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated to determine the usefulness of this measure in early pregnancy. The psychometric properties of the PSQI were evaluated in women at 14 weeks of pregnancy and revealed the instrument to have good internal consistency and convergent and divergent reliability properties. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the removal of the PSQI sleeping medications sub-scale from the global sleep quality total score calculation would improve the utility of this measure in early pregnancy. Women classified as depressed on the basis of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were found to have significantly poorer sleep quality scores on the majority of PSQI sub-scales. The relationship between sleep quality and depression was found to be statistically significant and clinically relevant during early pregnancy and the PSQI would appear to be an appropriate measure to assess sleep quality in this group.

AB  - Introduction To determine the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with overall sleep duration among pregnant women. Methods Data from the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used. All women (n = 2951) of childbearing age (18-44 years) who were pregnant and responded to all fruit and vegetable consumption and sleep duration questions were included. Covariates included age, race, education level, exercise, and marital status. Data were analyzed using linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results Total daily fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with sleep duration among pregnant women, controlling for confounders [β = −0.03, (−0.07, 0.00)]. Orange and green vegetable consumption were both inversely associated with sleep duration [β = −0.19, (−0.38, −0.01) and β = −0.20, (−0.33, −0.08) respectively]. Ordinal logistic regression found that the odds of meeting or exceeding sleep time recommendations increased slightly with each unit increase in total fruit and vegetable consumption [OR = 1.05 (1.003, 1.092)] and for every unit increase in fruit consumption [OR = 1.12 (1.038, 1.208)]. Women who exercised within the past 30 days reported approximately 20 min of additional sleep compared to those who did not [β = 0.32 (0.16, 0.49)]. Age, employment status, and marital status were also independently associated with sleep duration. Discussion Sleep duration in pregnant women was associated with exercise and other demographic factors, but only mildly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Future research should investigate the effects of additional factors including sleep quality, gestational age, family status and other medications as potential confounders.

AB  - Objective: To report maternal sleep practices in women who experienced a stillbirth compared with controls with ongoing live pregnancies at similar gestation.Design: Prospective case-control study.Setting: Forty-one maternity units in the United Kingdom.Population: Women who had a stillbirth after ≥ 28 weeks' gestation (n = 291) and women with an ongoing pregnancy at the time of interview (n = 733).Methods: Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire that included questions on maternal sleep practices before pregnancy, in the four weeks prior to, and on the night before the interview/stillbirth.Main Outcome Measures: Maternal sleep practices during pregnancy.Results: In multivariable analysis, supine going-to-sleep position the night before stillbirth had a 2.3-fold increased risk of late stillbirth [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.04-5.11] compared with the left side. In addition, women who had a stillbirth were more likely to report sleep duration less than 5.5 hours on the night before stillbirth (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.68), getting up to the toilet once or less (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.85-4.26), and a daytime nap every day (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.94). No interaction was detected between supine going-to-sleep position and a small-for-gestational-age infant, maternal body mass index, or gestational age. The population-attributable risk for supine going-to-sleep position was 3.7% (95% CI 0.5-9.2).Conclusions: This study confirms that supine going-to-sleep position is associated with late stillbirth. Further work is required to determine whether intervention(s) can decrease the frequency of supine going-to-sleep position and the incidence of late stillbirth.Tweetable Abstract: Supine going-to-sleep position is associated with 2.3× increased risk of stillbirth after 28 weeks' gestation.Plain Language Summary: Stillbirth, the death of a baby before birth, is a tragedy for mothers and families. One approach to reduce stillbirths is to identify factors that are associated with stillbirth. There are few risk factors for stillbirth that can be easily changed, but this study is looking at identifying how mothers may be able to reduce their risk. In this study, we interviewed 291 women who had a stillbirth and 733 women who had a live-born baby from 41 maternity units throughout the UK. The mothers who had a stillbirth were interviewed as soon as practical after their baby died. Mothers who had a live birth were interviewed during their pregnancies at the same times in pregnancy as when the stillbirths occurred. We did not interview mothers who had twins or who had a baby with a major abnormality. Mothers who went to sleep on their back had at least twice the risk of stillbirth compared with mothers who went to sleep on their left-hand side. This study suggests that 3.7% of stillbirths after 28 weeks of pregnancy were linked with going to sleep lying on the back. This study also shows that the link between going-to-sleep position and late stillbirth was not affected by the duration of pregnancy after 28 weeks, the size of the baby, or the mother's weight. Women who got up to the toilet once or more at night had a reduced risk of stillbirth. This is the largest of four similar studies that have all shown the same link between the position in which a mother goes to sleep and stillbirth after 28 weeks of pregnancy. Further studies are needed to see whether women can easily change their sleep position in late pregnancy and whether changing the position a mother goes to sleep in reduces stillbirth.

AB  - Study Objectives: Our investigation aims to assess the impact of symptoms of maternal sleep-disordered breathing, specifically sleep apnea risk and daytime sleepiness, on fetal leukocyte telomere length.Participants and Setting: Pregnant women were recruited upon hospital delivery admission.Interventions: Sleep exposure outcomes were measured using the Berlin Questionnaire to quantify sleep apnea and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to measure daytime sleepiness. Participants were classified as "High Risk" or "Low Risk" for sleep apnea based on responses to the Berlin, while "Normal" or "Abnormal" daytime sleepiness was determined based on responses to the Epworth.Design: Neonatal umbilical cord blood samples (N = 67) were collected and genomic DNA was isolated from cord blood leukocytes using Quantitative PCR. A ratio of relative telomere length was derived by telomere repeat copy number and single copy gene copy number (T/S ratio) and used to compare telomere lengths. Bootstrap and ANOVA statistical procedures were employed.Measurements and Results: On the Berlin, 68.7% of participants were classified as Low Risk while 31.3% were classified as High Risk for sleep apnea. According to the Epworth scale, 80.6% were determined to have Normal daytime sleepiness, and 19.4% were found to have Abnormal daytime sleepiness. The T/S ratio among pregnant women at High Risk for sleep apnea was significantly shorter than for those at Low Risk (P value < 0.05), and the T/S ratio among habitual snorers was significantly shorter than among non-habitual snorers (P value < 0.05). Although those with Normal Sleepiness had a longer T/S ratio than those with Abnormal Sleepiness, the difference was not statistically significant.Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating shortened telomere length among fetuses exposed to maternal symptoms of sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy, and suggest sleep disordered breathing as a possible mechanism of accelerated chromosomal aging.

AB  - Little is known about modifiable lifestyle factors beyond quitting smoking that could prevent preterm delivery (PTD, <37 weeks gestation). We examined the individual and joint associations of pre-pregnancy BMI, second trimester exercise and sleep on PTD. We conducted a nested, population-based case-control study interviewing postpartum 344 cases delivering at <37 weeks, as identified by clinical estimate of gestational age from prenatal screening records, and 698 term controls, excluding term low birthweight. Eligible women participated in California's statewide Prenatal Screening Program, worked during pregnancy, and delivered a singleton birth in Southern California in 2002-2003. Modeled separately, moderate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.96-per hour/week) and vigorous (OR = 0.67; 95 % CI = 0.46-0.98 for yes vs. no) exercise during the second trimester were associated with a reduced odds of PTD, and sleep duration was not (OR = 1.09, 95 % CI = 0.80-1.48 for <7 h; OR = 0.88, 95 % CI = 0.57-1.48 for >8 h vs. 7-8 h). When sleep and exercise variables were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85-0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 24 kg/m (OR = 0.85; 95 % CI = 0.79-0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both pre-conceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the United States.

T2  - Canadian Journal of Public Health
AB  - Objectives: Tests of the relationship between sleep and overweight/obesity (OW/OB) among women have been inconsistent. Few studies reporting such associations have focused on women of childbearing age. This paper investigates this association among Canadian women of childbearing age.Methods: Data were from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2011-2014. The sample consisted of women aged 18-44 years. All variables were self-reported. Sleep duration was dichotomized as insufficient (< 7 h/night) or adequate (≥ 7 h/night). A composite score of sleep quality was used and dichotomized as poor none/little of the time or some/most/all of the time. Height and weight were used to calculate body mass index. Associations between sleep and OW/OB were assessed using logistic regression analyses with survey weights. Three models were computed for sleep duration/quality: model without covariates, model adjusted for demographics (age, ethnicity, level of education, household income, marital status, employment, parity, region, and season), and model adjusted for demographics and variables associated with OW/OB (mood disorder, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol).Results: Total sample consisted of 9749 women of childbearing age. Thirty-eight percent had insufficient sleep duration. Sleep duration was significantly associated with OW/OB in the model with no covariates and discriminated 52.8% of women of childbearing age, but this association was no longer significant in the models adjusted for covariates. Sleep quality was not significantly linked to OW/OB in any of the models.Conclusion: Targeting sleep alone would likely not contribute to lower risk of OW/OB among Canadian women of childbearing age. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that inadequate sleep can cause both obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Short sleep duration in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Methods An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA1c levels were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were excluded from the analyses. Results Childhood sleep duration did not predict adult HbA1c. However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with higher levels of HbA1c (p=0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes (p=0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA1c was independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. Conclusions Short sleep duration is associated with higher levels of HbA1c and an increased risk of prediabetes in young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.

AB  - Objective: Sleep is critical for glucose metabolism. Pregnant women often have sleep disturbances and extreme sleep duration. Investigations of the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have reported inconsistent results. The present study aimed to meta-analyze the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk.Methods: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for studies that were published up to October 2017, that reported associations between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes for all studies. Heterogeneity and potential publication biases were assessed.Results: A total of 4366 papers were retrieved, among which seven studies assessed the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM development. The seven articles included 18,203 subjects at baseline and 1294 GDM cases during follow-up. Compared to normal sleep duration, extreme sleep duration during early and middle pregnant stages had a close relationship with GDM based upon pooled data from prospective and cross-sectional studies. Prospective results showed that long sleep duration during pregnancy was a risk factor for GDM, but not short sleep duration. Publication biases were found when analyzing the relationship between extreme sleep duration and GDM.Conclusions: Extreme sleep duration during pregnancy is closely associated with GDM. Moreover, long but not short sleep duration can predict the risk of developing GDM. These findings remind us of the importance of sleep duration control during pregnancy and help optimize early strategies for the prevention of GDM.

AB  - Objective: To estimate whether sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Methods: In this prospective cohort study, nulliparous women underwent in-home sleep-disordered breathing assessments in early (6-15 weeks of gestation) and midpregnancy (22-31 weeks of gestation). Participants and health care providers were blinded to the sleep test results. An apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or greater was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Exposure-response relationships were examined, grouping participants into four apnea-hypopnea index groups: 0, greater than 0 to less than 5, 5 to less than 15, and 15 or greater. The study was powered to test the primary hypothesis that sleep-disordered breathing occurring in pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, defined as preeclampsia and antepartum gestational hypertension, and GDM. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.Results: Three thousand seven hundred five women were enrolled. Apnea-hypopnea index data were available for 3,132 (84.5%) and 2,474 (66.8%) women in early and midpregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%. The prevalence of preeclampsia was 6.0%, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 13.1%, and GDM 4.1%. In early and midpregnancy the adjusted odds ratios for preeclampsia when sleep-disordered breathing was present were 1.94 (95% CI 1.07-3.51) and 1.95 (95% CI 1.18-3.23), respectively; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 1.46 (95% CI 0.91-2.32) and 1.73 (95% CI 1.19-2.52); and GDM 3.47 (95% CI 1.95-6.19) and 2.79 (95% CI 1.63-4.77). Increasing exposure-response relationships were observed between apnea-hypopnea index and both hypertensive disorders and GDM.Conclusion: There is an independent association between sleep-disordered breathing and preeclampsia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and GDM.

AB  - Objective:This prospective observational study explored the association of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as determined by screening measures for OSA and sleep studies.Study Design:Two symptom-based screening questionnaires, the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), were administered to enroll 1509 gravidae. Screen-positive subjects were referred for polysomnography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to estimate the relative risks of associations.Result:One thousand one hundred and fifty-seven subjects were available for outcomes analysis. Screening positive on the BQ was positively associated with hypertensive disorders in GLM models (adjusted relative risk=1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.37).Conclusion:In this large prospective trial, GLM modeling suggests that the BQ but not the ESS demonstrated significant association with measured adverse pregnancy outcomes, and specific items predicted these outcomes better than others. However, causative association of BQ with OSA cannot be assumed.

TI  - Association of fatigue and preterm birth in active duty military women.
AU  - Stinson JC
AB  - The purposes of this study were to: (1) describe the internal and external environmental demands of fatigue correlates in pregnant military women, and (2) determine the relationship between fatigue at 22-26 weeks gestation and the incidence of preterm labor and birth in military women. Inclusion criteria included those designed to minimize confounders for preterm labor and delivery such as no history of preterm delivery. Data were collected prospectively at 22-26 weeks gestation by questionnaires including the Profile of Moods States, Visual Analog Scale-Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance Scale, Life Events Questionnaire, Support Behavior Index, and Occupational Fatigue Index (OFI). A fatigue diary was completed over 2 consecutive work days and mailed back to the Principal Investigator. Telephone follow up of hours worked per week was conducted until the participants delivered. Postpartum charts were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. The sample consisted of 359 women, predominantly White (62%), enlisted (91%), Navy (72%) with a mean age of 23.9 years. Hierarchical linear regression models with 11 variables explained 36% of the variance in fatigue while 14 variables explained 30% of the variance in energy. Independent variables making unique contributions to fatigue severity perception were sleep disturbance, negative life events and role demands. Hierarchical logistic regression models revealed no significant relationship between preterm birth (9.5%) and fatigue severity or occupational fatigue but a trend toward lower fatigue severity chi2 = 3.78, p = .0552) and posture subscale of the OFI (chi2 = 2.39, p = .12) with preterm labor (13.6%). When placed in multivariate models, neither fatigue or occupational fatigue were related to preterm labor and birth. However, officer rank was associated with both preterm labor (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.08, 6.98) and preterm birth (OR = 4.14, 95% CI = 1.54, 11.08). Low sleep disturbance (OR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.09, 5.07) and negative life events (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.08) were also related to preterm labor. These findings suggest that the military woman who is at risk for preterm labor is a high energy officer experiencing stress and that fatigue is protective against premature birth. The results support investigation of interventions which examine the pregnant officer and activities in a high energy group which may lead to preterm labor.

AB  - Shorter sleep duration is linked to obesity, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. Whether sleep deprivation during the postpartum period affects maternal postpartum weight retention remains unknown. This study examined the association of sleep at 6 months postpartum with substantial postpartum weight retention (SPPWR), defined as 5 kg or more above pregravid weight at 1 year postpartum. The authors selected 940 participants in Project Viva who enrolled during early pregnancy from 1999 to 2002. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios of SPPWR for sleep categories, controlling for sociodemographic, prenatal, and behavioral attributes. Of the 940 women, 124 (13%) developed SPPWR. Sleep distributions were as follows: 114 (12%) women slept < or =5 hours/day, 280 (30%) slept 6 hours/day, 321 (34%) slept 7 hours/day, and 225 (24%) slept > or =8 hours/day. Adjusted odds ratios of SPPWR were 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.42, 6.94) for < or =5 hours/day, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.97) for 6 hours/day, and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.78) for > or =8 hours/day versus 7 hours/day (p = 0.012). The adjusted odds ratio for SPPWR of 2.05 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.78) was twofold greater (p = 0.02) for a decrease in versus no change in sleep at 1 year postpartum. Sleeping < or =5 hours/day at 6 months postpartum was strongly associated with retaining > or =5 kg at 1 year postpartum. Interventions to prevent postpartum obesity should consider strategies to attain optimal maternal sleep duration.

AB  - Objective: To assess sleep practices, and investigate their relationship with maternal and fetal outcomes, among pregnant Ghanaian women.Methods: In a cross-sectional study conducted at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana, between June and July 2011, postpartum women were interviewed within 48hours of delivery about sleep quality and practices during pregnancy. Interviews were coupled with a systematic review of participants' medical charts for key outcomes including maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, low birth weight, and stillbirth.Results: Most women reported poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Snoring during pregnancy was independently associated with pre-eclampsia (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.5; P=0.007). The newborns of women who reported supine sleep during pregnancy were at increased risk of low birth weight (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-20.2; P=0.025) and stillbirth (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.5-43.2; P=0.016). Low birth weight was found to mediate the relationship between supine sleep and stillbirth.Conclusion: The present findings in an African population demonstrate that maternal sleep, a modifiable risk factor, has a significant role in pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, and subsequently stillbirth.

AB  - Objective: To assess the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with concurrent restless legs syndrome (RLS) and daytime sleepiness. We also prospectively examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4 years of follow-up.Methods: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional study of 65,544 women (aged 41-58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had restless legs ≥ 5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review.Results: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS (15+ times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and 2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-3.93), severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65-6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42) compared with women without MS. Among the 172 women who had MS and were free of RLS in 2005, 9 developed RLS (5.2%) during a 4-year period and all had severe RLS. The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 (95% CI 1.53-8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS.Conclusion: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in non-obstetrical and obstetrical patients.Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of OSA and its relationship with pregnancy-related complications in a general obstetric population of Department of Defense beneficiaries receiving direct-care at military treatment facilities.Study Design: A retrospective cohort study of all women (N=305,001) who gave birth at a military treatment facility from 2008 to 2014. OSA cases were randomly selected and matched on age (3:1 ratio) to non OSA cases. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes (cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, postoperative wound complications, hospital stay greater than five days, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, and stillbirth) between pregnant women with and without a diagnosis of OSA. Cases were identified using ICD-9 codes, while controlling for demographics, obesity, and medical comorbidities associated with OSA and the outcomes of interest.Results: We identified 266 cases of OSA (OSA rate=8.7 per 10,000; increased from 6.4 to 9.9 per 10,000 from 2009 to 2013). OSA was associated with a higher odds of cesarean delivery (AOR,1.60; 95% CI, 1.06-2.40), gestational hypertension, (AOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.30-4.68), preeclampsia (AOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.43-4.09), and preterm delivery (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09-3.30).Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

AB  - Objective To examine the independent and joint relationships of poor subjective sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation among pregnant women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders. Results Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P < .001). After adjustment for confounders including maternal depression, poor subjective sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of > 5 vs. ≤ 5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=1.67; 95% CI 1.02–2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR=1.18; 95% CI 1.08–1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a 3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=3.48; 95% CI 1.96–6.18) as compared with those who had neither risk factor. Conclusion Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation. Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.

AB  - This cohort study examines mothers with a broad range of depression and anxiety symptom severity and performed magnetic resonance imaging on their 1-month-old infants to assess the association between exposre to prenatal depression and anxiety and offspring white matter microstructure. Key Points: Question: Are prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms associated with individual variations of offspring white matter microstructure? Findings: In this cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads, prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with infants' white matter microstructure at 1 month of age. Moreover, analyses suggest that prenatal maternal depression and anxiety may be differentially associated with infant male and female microstructure. Meaning: The prenatal environment is important to early brain development, and underlying white matter microstructure may be susceptible to the continuum of maternal depression and anxiety symptom exposure during the prenatal period. Importance: Maternal depression and anxiety can have deleterious and lifelong consequences on child development. However, many aspects of the association of early brain development with maternal symptoms remain unclear. Understanding the timing of potential neurobiological alterations holds inherent value for the development and evaluation of future therapies and interventions. Objective: To examine the association between exposure to prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms and offspring white matter microstructure at 1 month of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads used a composite of depression and anxiety symptoms measured in mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy and measures of white matter microstructure characterized in the mothers' 1-month offspring using diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging performed from October 1, 2014, to November 30, 2016. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research facility during natural, nonsedated sleep. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the association between maternal depression and anxiety and 1-month infant white matter microstructure as measured by diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging findings. Results: In the 101 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] age of mothers, 33.22 [3.99] years; mean age of infants at magnetic resonance imaging, 33.07 days [range, 18-50 days]; 92 white mothers [91.1%]; 53 male infants [52.5%]), lower 1-month white matter microstructure (decreased neurite density and increased mean, radial, and axial diffusivity) was associated in right frontal white matter microstructure with higher prenatal maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. Significant sex × symptom interactions with measures of white matter microstructure were also observed, suggesting that white matter development may be differentially sensitive to maternal depression and anxiety symptoms in males and females during the prenatal period. Conclusions and Relevance: These data highlight the importance of the prenatal period to early brain development and suggest that the underlying white matter microstructure is associated with the continuum of prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate relationships among obesity in pregnancy and plasma levels of tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenine (KYN), inflammatory markers, and depressed mood. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 374) were enrolled, and data were collected at a mean gestation of 20 weeks in this cross-sectional study. Plasma was analyzed for TRP, KYN, neopterin, and nitrite levels. Women completed demographic and mood scales. Results: There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between body mass index (BMI) and TRP and positive correlations between BMI and KYN and the kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio. Neopterin was correlated with KYN/TRP, suggesting that the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) enzyme was activated. The correlations of neopterin and nitrite with BMI were too small to be clinically meaningful but may provide mechanistic insight. There was a correlation between depressed mood and nitrite levels. Depressed mood was also associated with lower TRP levels. When the sample was divided into pregnant women with or without obesity, TRP was significantly lower and the KYN/TRP ratio was significantly higher in the women with obesity. Conclusion: The pro-inflammatory state of obesity in pregnancy may drive activation of IDO-1, resulting in diversion of TRP away from serotonin and melatonin production and toward KYN metabolites. This alteration could contribute to depression, impaired sleep, increased production of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, and reinforcement of a pro-inflammatory state in pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Women of childbearing age (18–44 years) present an important group for understanding sleep, but few studies have focused on this population. No study has investigated the associations among sleep, overweight/obesity, and risk of type 2 diabetes among childbearing-age women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods: Data were from NHANES, 2005–2008. The study population consisted of 18–44 year old women. Pregnant women and those diagnosed with sleep disorders were excluded. Sleep duration and quality were self-reported. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) measurements, and a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed by trained NHANES staff. An unadjusted linear regression analysis; a second adjusted for demographics only (partially adjusted model); and a third adjusted for demographics and variables associated with overweight/obesity and diabetes (fully adjusted model) were computed to assess associations among sleep duration/quality and BMI, WC, and 2-hour OGTT. Results: Total sample consisted of 2388 childbearing-age women. Only sleep duration was significantly associated with BMI and WC in the unadjusted and partially adjusted models, but was no longer significant in the fully adjusted model. Neither sleep duration nor quality was significantly associated with 2-hour OGTT in any of the models. Conclusions: Targeting sleep duration and sleep quality alone would not likely contribute to significantly lower BMI, WC, or risk of type 2 diabetes in US childbearing-age women. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones using objective measures of sleep, are needed to confirm these findings.

AU  - Branjerdporn, Grace
AU  - Meredith, Pamela
AU  - Strong, Jenny
AU  - Garcia, Jenniffer
T2  - Maternal & Child Health Journal
AB  - Objectives Infant developmental outcomes may be influenced by a range of prenatal maternal characteristics. While there is some evidence to suggest that maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, there is a need to systematically review this evidence to guide future research and clinical practice. Methods Five electronic databases were systematically scanned. Key journals and reference lists were hand-searched. Papers were included if: (1) pregnant women were assessed for maternal-foetal attachment; (2) the infants were later assessed, under 2 years old, for any developmental outcome (e.g., social-emotional, cognition, motor, language, adaptive behaviour); and (3) they were published in English. Two independent reviewers used the STROBE checklist to appraise the quality of each paper. Results Of the 968 papers identified, eight were included in the review, and four of these were of low quality (<60 %) based on the STROBE. The developmental domains that were examined included: infant temperament (n = 5), adaptive behaviour (e.g., colic, sleep) (n = 2), and milestone attainment (n = 1). There is some evidence to suggest that lower maternal-foetal attachment is related to suboptimal developmental outcomes. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited and low quality studies available. Conclusions Although maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, future research is required which: (1) considers a range of developmental outcomes, (2) has increased scientific rigour, (3) assesses mother-infant dyads at different prenatal and postnatal time points, and (4) examines different target populations.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the cross-sectional associations between musculoskeletal pain experience and measures of pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study.Participants and Methods: In total, 917 participants were eligible for analysis if they provided data pertaining to musculoskeletal pain status at the 22-year follow-up and had data for at least 1 valid pain sensitivity test. Standardized protocols were used to assess pressure pain threshold (4 sites: lumbar spine, tibialis anterior, upper trapezius, and wrist) and cold pain threshold (wrist). Four pain experience groups ("No pain" [n=562, 61.3%], "Low" [n=84, 9.2%], "Medium" [n=147, 16.0%], "High" [n=124, 13.5%]) were determined by latent class analysis using parameters of pain chronicity, frequency, intensity, and number of pain areas. Variables considered as confounders included sex, age, ethnicity, waist-hip ratio, psychological symptoms, sleep quality, physical activity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and income.Results: There were no associations between pain experience and pressure pain sensitivity after adjusting for confounders. The "Medium" and "High" pain experience groups demonstrated heightened cold pain sensitivity compared with the "No pain" group (P=0.023), adjusted for sex and smoking.Discussion: This study provides the most extensive investigation of the relationship between musculoskeletal pain experience and pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults. Heightened cold pain sensitivity in those classified as "Medium" and "High" pain experience may suggest altered nociceptive processing and has implications for clinical management.

AB  - Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period. A risk factor for mood disorders is poor sleep quality. In this study we investigate the effects of poor subjective prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of prenatal depression or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population.Methods: We analysed data from a subset of women taking part in a prospective cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes. The participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory between 26 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (Time 1) and at 3 months postpartum (Time 2), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at Time 1. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, while adjusting for prenatal depressive/anxiety symptoms and education.Results: Although borderline-high depressive/anxiety symptoms were the strongest predictors of postnatal depressive/anxiety, independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality during pregnancy was also associated with borderline-high postnatal depressive symptoms, but not with postnatal anxiety.Limitations: Sleep quality and prenatal/postnatal mood were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more susceptible to bias.Conclusion: Although treatment of symptoms of prenatal depression and anxiety will be the most important for reducing postnatal depression and anxiety, in addition to that, future studies may explore treatments improving prenatal sleep quality, particularly for women with antenatal depressive symptoms.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the influence of maternal self-reported habitual sleep duration during early pregnancy on blood pressure (BP) levels and risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Clinic-based study. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated. Mean 1st and 2nd trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar among women reporting to be short sleepers (< or = 6 h) vs. women reporting to sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy were associated with increased mean 3rd trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 3rd trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting < or = 6 h and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean 3rd trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (> or = 10 h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (< 5 h) and long (> or = 10 h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for PE. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with a larger literature that documents elevated blood pressure and increased risks of hypertension with short and long sleep duration.

AB  - Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, little is known about the association of SDB with timing of delivery. We examined the association of snoring frequency, a key SDB marker, and snoring intensity, a correlate of SDB severity, with time-to-delivery among a cohort of pregnant women.Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 1483 third trimester pregnant women were recruited from the University of Michigan prenatal clinics. Women completed a questionnaire about their sleep, and demographic and pregnancy information was abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of those with hypertension or diabetes, 954 women were classified into two groups by their snoring onset timing, chronic or pregnancy-onset. Within each of these groups, women were divided into four groups based on their snoring frequency and intensity: non-snorers; infrequent-quiet; frequent-quiet; or frequent-loud snorers. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between snoring frequency and intensity and time-to-delivery, adjusting for maternal characteristics.Results: Chronic snoring was reported by half of the pregnant women, and of those, 7% were frequent-loud snorers. Deliveries before 38 weeks' gestation are completed occurred among 25% of women with chronic, frequent-loud snoring. Compared with pre-pregnancy non-snorers, women with chronic frequent-loud snoring had an increased hazard ratio for delivery (adjusted hazard ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.45).Conclusions: Snoring frequency and intensity is associated with time-to-delivery in women absent of hypertension or diabetes. Frequent-loud snoring may have a clinical utility to identify otherwise low-risk women who are likely to deliver earlier.

AB  - Aims: A longitudinal birth cohort provides an opportunity to study the impact of childhood conditions persisting into adulthood. This study examines the cross-sectional association of asthma with sleep quality and snoring in the adolescent and young adult population and the extent to which asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years independently predict themselves or each other at 21 years.Methods: Data from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children recruited into the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223). Complete asthma and sleep information (questionnaire data) was available for 5015 participants at 14 years and 3527 at 21 years, with 3237 participants at both 14 and 21 years.Results: Poor sleep quality and snoring were independently associated with asthma at 14 years and 21 years, with stronger associations evident in women. At 21 years, associations were mediated by asthma symptom severity. Asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years each strongly and independently predicted themselves at 21 years. Asthma at 14 years predicted snoring at 21 years, while poor sleep quality and snoring in women predicted asthma at 21 years, the latter partially mediated by body mass index.Conclusions: The relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring varied by gender. Sleep quality and snoring should be considered in the assessment and holistic management of asthma. The predictive relationship seen between 14 and 21 years provides an opportunity to address these issues at a younger age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns regarding potential harmful effect of medications on fetuses often result in inadequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy, whereas risks posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma are often underestimated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of maternal asthma on preterm delivery and fetal growth. METHODS: Study participants were individuals enrolled in the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists Asthma Medications in Pregnancy Study between February 1, 1998, and December 31, 2003. Pregnant women with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 719) evaluated their asthma control repeatedly during pregnancy based on symptom frequency and interference with daily activities and sleep and reported hospitalizations and unscheduled clinic visits for asthma exacerbations. The incidence of preterm delivery, the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, and mean birth weight were evaluated relative to asthma symptom control and exacerbation measures. RESULTS: The incidence of preterm delivery was significantly higher among patients with inadequate asthma symptom control during the first part of pregnancy (11.4%) compared with patients with adequate asthma control (6.3%; P = .02). Similarly, patients who were hospitalized for asthma during pregnancy had a higher incidence of preterm delivery (16.4%) compared with asthmatic women without a history of hospitalization (7.6%; P = .02). The effect seemed independent from use of systemic corticosteroids and other covariates. Neither the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction nor mean birth weight varied by any measures of asthma symptom control or exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a substantial risk for preterm delivery posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma and provides additional evidence regarding the importance of adequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy to maintain optimal asthma control.

AB  - This study aimed to explore attitudes towards family formation in single or cohabiting childless women of advanced age. The design comprised semi-structured qualitative interviews of 20 women aged 34–39 years attending the Fertility Assessment and Counselling Clinic, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. A sample of 10 single women and 10 cohabiting women was chosen with equal distribution of postgraduate education length. Data were analysed using content analysis following the method of Graneheim and Lundman and consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ). The general attitude towards family formation was characterized by a fear of the consequences of choosing motherhood on one hand, and a ‘ticking biological clock’ and a wish to establish a nuclear family on the other. The women idealized the perception of perfect mothering in terms of uncompromising expectations of child rearing and showed an increasing awareness of solo motherhood as a possible solution to advanced age, the wish of a child and single status compared to earlier studies. Our study contributes to knowledge and understanding of personal considerations related to childbearing in nullipara women in their mid- to late 30s and may be useful in a fertility assessment and counselling setting.

TI  - Auditory development in the fetus and infant.
AU  - Graven SN
AU  - Browne JV
T2  - Newborn & Infant Nursing Reviews
AB  - Auditory development in the fetus and infant entails the structural parts of the ears that develop in the first 20 weeks of gestation, and the neurosensory part of the auditory system develops primarily after 20 weeks' gestational age. The auditory system becomes functional at around 25 weeks' gestation. The cochlea of the middle ear and the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are most important in the development of the auditory system. They are both easily affected by the environment and care practices in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU). The period from 25 weeks' gestation to 5 to 6 months of age is most critical to the development of the neurosensory part of the auditory system. This is the time when the hair cells of the cochlea, the axons of the auditory nerve, and the neurons of the temporal lobe auditory cortex are tuned to receive signals of specific frequencies and intensities. Unlike the visual system, the auditory system requires outside auditory stimulation. This needs to include speech, music, and meaningful sounds from the environment. The preterm as well as the term infant cannot recognize or discriminate meaningful sounds with background noise levels greater than 60 dB. The more intense the background noise, especially low frequency, the fewer specific frequencies (pitch) can be heard and used to tune the hair cells of the cochlea. Continuous exposure to loud background noise in the NICU or home will interfere with auditory development and especially frequency discrimination. The initial stimulation of the auditory system (speech and music) needs to occur in utero or in the NICU to develop tonotopic columns in the auditory cortex and to have the critical tuning of the hair cells of the cochlea occur. The control of outside noise, the exposure to meaningful speech sounds and music, and the protection of sleep and sleep cycles, especially rapid eye movement sleep, are essential for healthy auditory development. The environment and care practices for the fetus in utero or the infant in the NICU are critical factors in the development of the auditory system. Copyright © 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: To investigate whether or not infants exposed to methamphetamine prenatally have impaired arousal responses from sleep.Methods: The polygraphic nap studies involved 42 infants aged 3 months exposed to methamphetamine in utero and a comparison group of 57 infants. A proportion of mothers in both groups smoked cigarettes and/or marijuana and drank alcohol during pregnancy. White noise from 50 to 100 decibels (dB) was administered at 10 dB intervals twice within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states and arousal thresholds measured.Results: Combining groups, 306 tests were completed (128 and 178 within REM and NREM sleep, respectively) and infants were more likely to wake at lower thresholds in REM than NREM sleep (hazard ratio 5.58; 95% CI, 3.78-8.23 p < 0.0001). No significant differences in arousal threshold were found between methamphetamine and comparison groups, before or after controlling for other substance use (NREM sleep; 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60-1.59 and REM sleep; 1.03, 95% CI, 0.56-1.89).Conclusions: These findings suggest that arousal responses of methamphetamine-exposed infants remain intact, providing no support for the hypothesis that prenatal exposure could increase their vulnerability to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) through arousal deficits.

AB  - The two principal challenges of neonatal physiologic monitoring device are: (1) the development of computational strategies that consider the rudimentary forms of neonatal sleep state especially for preterm infants and (2) any physiologic monitoring device for clinical applications in a neonatal intensive care setting must be small, portable, and user-friendly. Our multicenter neonatal sleep consortium has acquired more than 1,100 multihour EEG-sleep recordings on over 370 neonates, ranging from 24 to 44 weeks gestation. Each recording was visually-scored for state, arousals, movements, and rapid eye movements, which were used as templates when applying spectral analyses. The authors have defined a brain dysmaturity index to represent functional brain reorganization as the prenate matures to a full-term age; delayed or accelerated physiologic behaviors have been described for the preterm cohort when compared to the full-term group at the same postmenstrual age. Seven EEG-sleep measures comprise this index: quiet sleep percentage, sleep cycle length, rapid eye movements, arousals, spectral beta EEG energies, spectral EEG correlations, and a spectral measure of respiratory regularity. Linear and nonlinear computational algorithms are being developed to automate the computation of the dysmaturity index and to identify new feature types that correlate with dysmaturity. Automated neonatal sleep monitoring system can potentially improve neonatal neurointensive care by facilitating analyses of pervasive neonatal brain disorders expressed primarily as altered sleep state organization, and help predict altered developmental trajectories of children at higher risk for neurologic sequelae.

AB  - HATA, T.,et al.: Autonomic Modulation of Sinus and Atrioventricular Nodes in Premature Low-Birth-Weight Infants. Respiratory vagal activity is expressed by heart rate variability (HRV) at approximately 1 month of age in premature low-birth-weight infants (PLBWI). However, the autonomic inputs into the sinus node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN) in PLBWI are unclear. We evaluated the variability in PP and PR intervals at day zero (day 0) and 1 month (1 month) after birth in 16 PLBWI (gestation 32.3± 1.3 weeks, birth weight 1.578± 257 g). The polygraph was recorded during sleep on day 0 and at 1 month. PP and PR intervals and the number of respiratory cycles were measured, and frequency analysis was performed by auto-correlation fast Fourier transforms. Power spectral density (PSD: ms2) was calculated for the low frequency domain (LF: 0.036~0.146 Hz), high frequency domain (HF: 0.146~0.390 Hz), total frequency (TF: 0.036~2.000 Hz), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA: frequency bandwidth of 0.3 Hz with peak respiratory frequency as median), and the PSD ratio in the PP and PR intervals (LF/HF, RSA/TF) were compared. Compared with day 0, a decrease in the LF/HF ratio and an increase in the RSA/TF ratio in PP intervals were observed at 1 month, consistent with expression of respiratory vagal activity. For PR intervals, on the other hand, the LF/HF ratio increased, indicative of accentuated sympathetic activity. However, the respiratory vagal input was weak, and the RSA/TF ratio remained unchanged. These observations suggest that, in PLBWI at 1 month, AVN conduction was not predominatly influenced by respiratory-related vagal activity, but was controlled by autonomic regulation, independent of the SAN.(PACE 2005; 28:S288-S291)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of back pain and treatment satisfaction in a population of low-socioeconomic pregnant women. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design to determine the prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy for 599 women. Women completed an author-generated musculoskeletal survey in the second trimester of their pregnancy that addressed pain history, duration, location, and intensity, as well as activities of daily living, treatment frequency, and satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of the total population reported musculoskeletal pain, and nearly half presented with a multi-focal pattern of pain that involved 2 or more sites. Twenty-one percent reported severe pain intensity rated on a numerical rating scale. Eighty percent of women experiencing pain slept less than 4 hours per night and 75% of these women took pain medications. Importantly, 85% of the women surveyed perceived that they had not been offered treatment for their musculoskeletal disorders. CONCLUSION: Multi-focal musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy was prevalent in this underserved patient population. The pain in this population negatively affected sleep and treatment appeared inadequate.

TI  - Bed rest and activity restriction for women at risk for preterm birth: a survey of Canadian prenatal care providers.
AU  - Sprague AE
AB  - This study explored the practises of Canadian obstetricians, family physicians, and midwives in recommending bed rest or activity restriction for women at risk for preterm birth and examined whether they had decisional conflict about using this therapy.A self-administered mail survey was sent to 1437 prenatal care providers. The questionnaire underwent expert review, content validity testing, revisions, translation into French and pre-testing. A proportionate stratified random sample of 30 percent was used for physicians. For midwives, a total population sample was taken in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec, and in Ontario a random sample of 30 percent was used. Using the Dillman protocol, each person in the sampling frame was contacted up to five times: pre-notice letter, first survey, reminder postcard, second survey, and third survey.Of the 1437 potential participants, 813 (56.6%) returned surveys. Of these, 1168 were eligible for the study and 516 (44.2%) completed surveys. Thirty-five percent of obstetricians, 42.7 percent of family practitioners and 21.4 percent of midwives recommended bed rest in hospital. Larger numbers recommended bed rest at home: 64.7 percent of obstetricians, 69.9 percent of family practitioners and 52.1 percent of midwives. Two-thirds of care providers indicated that bed rest was only 'fair to poor' in helping to prevent preterm birth. Cervical changes as compared to other warning signs of preterm labour led to increased use of bed rest at all gestational ages in singletons and multiples. Sixty-one percent of obstetricians, 71.7 percent of family physicians and 48.8 percent of midwives do NOT routinely recommend any sort of rehabilitative exercise program. The top five concerns about side effects associated with bed rest were deep vein thrombosis, stress, depression, sleep disturbances and economic problems. Care providers recommending bed rest have some decisional conflict as measured by the Provider Decision Process Assessment Instrument (mean score 30/60).Except for situations of multiple pregnancy, there is inconsistent practice in recommending bed rest. There is also inconsistency about the extent of activity restriction to recommend. This data provides some of the first Canadian perspective on the use of bed rest in pregnancy and the decisional conflict of care providers in recommending this therapy, and offers valuable background information for future clinical trials.

TI  - Bedsharing and maternal smoking in a population-based survey of new mothers.
AU  - Lahr MB
AU  - Rosenberg KD
AU  - Lapidus JA
T2  - Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the number 1 cause of postneonatal infant death. Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare. METHODS: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon's population. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked whether they shared a bed with their infant 'always,' 'almost always,' 'sometimes,' or 'never.' Frequent bedsharing was defined as 'always' or 'almost always'; infrequent was defined as 'sometimes' or 'never.' RESULTS: Of all new mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always: 14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1% sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among nonsmoking mothers. Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group. Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth certificates, weighted for nonresponse. CONCLUSIONS: Although a number of case series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants <8-11 weeks of age. Despite the preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners' anecdotal experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death 'suffocation' or 'overlay asphyxiation' simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of death. This 'diagnostic drift' may greatly complicate future studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants <3 months old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death, analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift. Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both, bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be delayed until 3 months of age.

AB  - The obstetric nurse returns to the scenery of reproductive health with their responsibilities enlarged, as strategy proposed by the OMS, for the reduction of the maternal and perinatal mortality rates, what increases the demands of better professional qualification, so that the interventions implemented for the protection of women's and children's health are effective and efficacious. In this perspective, we aimed to propose a behavior guideline for clinical actions of nurses in prenatal consultations based on the occurrence of Nursing phenomena in the physiological dimension, subsidized in the CIPE - alpha version. This study was developed in the Center of Natural Childbirth of the Center of Family Development of the Federal University of Ceara. The population was composed of 253 records of pregnant women that attended the prenatal nursing consultation in the period between July 2003 and August 2004 and the sample was composed of 62 records selected at random. The data were collected in the months of May and August 2004. The most prevalent phenomena in the pregnant women were: intermittent sleep (56,5%); functional dyspnea (51,6%); edema (37,1%); orthopnea (35,5%) and constipation (32,2%). The conduct guide's development made it possible to verify that the use of technologies is something accessible to Nursing and that the CIPE can contribute to a better organization of the nurse's actions during prenatal.

AB  - Sleep patterns and dream content may be affected by stressful life events such as pregnancy loss. Women who are pregnant subsequent to a prior pregnancy loss tend to have anxious and emotionally charged experiences during their pregnancies. Dreams can affect pregnancy outcomes, specifically premature birth. This qualitative study is the first investigation to explore sleep disturbances caused by dreams as experienced by a diverse group of women pregnant subsequent to a pregnancy loss. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 4 categories of dreams. We offer clinical assessment and intervention strategies to support these women prenatally and present suggestions for research to facilitate our understanding of their experiences.

TI  - Biochemistry of the menopause.
AU  - Honour, John W.
T2  - Annals of Clinical Biochemistry
AB  - The life of a human female is characterized from teenage years by monthly menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.

T2  - Journal of Women's Health & Gender-Based Medicine
AB  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology, including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions. Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies.

AB  - Biological processes and functions in women are well organized in time, as evidenced by the expression of ultradian (high frequency), circadian ( approximately 24-hour), circamensual ( approximately monthly), and circannual ( approximately yearly) rhythms and by the changes that occur with menarche, reproduction, and menopause. Attributes of women's circamensual structure have been explored in depth, particularly with regard to fertility/infertility and birth control. However, the role of 24-hour and other rhythms in health, disease, and treatment has been little studied. The symptom intensity of a variety of chronic medical conditions is rhythmic, as is the risk of severe events, such as stroke and myocardial infarct (MI). Improving the safety, efficacy, and preventive qualities of medications requires the understanding of how rhythms impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The therapeutic and adverse effects of prescription and nonprescription medications widely used by women can vary markedly with the (circadian) time of administration. Circadian rhythm-dependent differences in the safety of medications are particularly relevant to pregnant women; laboratory animal studies show that the fetal toxicity of various treatments varies not only with developmental stage but also with circadian time. Rhythm-dependent differences in the actions of medications are also of great importance to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, who are advised to ingest prescribed pharmacotherapy for osteopenia and osteoporosis in the morning to minimize the risk of adverse effects and, as a consequence, may elect to take other medications at times not recommended in the instructions for their use. Medication trials must be comprehensive and representative of women and men of different life stages, ethnicities, and likely times (morning vs. evening) of drug use.

AB  - Previous research suggests that maternal psycho-social-behavioral factors (such as psychological distress and negative life events) and elevated corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. However, studies to date have not examined the role of psycho-social-behavioral variables as predictors of elevated CRH. The goal of this study was to use multiple measures to obtain a more comprehensive picture of chronic maternal stress in an effort to more adequately evaluate the relationships between CRH and psycho-social-behavioral variables.One hundred twenty women, less than 20 weeks of gestation, were recruited, consented, and enrolled into the study. One hundred women had blood samples collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed for CRH. Eighty-five participants completed and returned self-administered questionnaires at 14-20 weeks gestation. Measures included perceived stress, depression, anxiety, social support, domestic violence/abuse, optimism levels, coping styles, and work, sleep, and nutritional patterns.The findings indicate significant weak associations between CRH (low vs. high) and sleep hours/night, hours of standing/day, reports of adequacy of income to meet needs, and the coping styles of 'religion,' 'disengagement,' and 'humor' (p < .05). Logistic regression modeling identified three predictor variables (adequacy of income to meet needs, and coping styles of 'religion' and 'disengagement') accounting for 42.2% of the variance in CRH level.These findings are the first to examine psycho-social-behavioral variables as predictors of CRH level in pregnancy. Women who report that their family incomes do not meet their needs had almost three times the odds for high CRH levels. Women who used religion and disengagement coping styles also had higher odds (14 and 7, respectively) for high CRH levels. Psycho-social-behavioral factors, including those identified as weak predictors of elevated CRH in this study, warrant additional consideration preparatory to establishing interventions to prevent preterm birth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses when placed skin-to-skin on their mother's chests, called kangaroo care (KC), for the first 6 hours after birth, instead of having the neonates go to an intensive care unit. DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used in this descriptive study to enroll neonates who were given continuous KC beginning soon after birth in the delivery room and continuing for 6 hours. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, abdominal temperature, and behavioral state were recorded each minute. SETTING: Data were collected in the delivery room and in a private labor room in tropical Cali, Colombia. PARTICIPANTS: Six 34-36-week preterm neonates with 5-minute APGAR scores of 6 or more were enrolled. Two neonates had grunting respirations before KC was begun. RESULTS: Temperature rose rapidly to thermoneutral range. With few exceptions, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits; grunting respirations in two neonates disappeared with warmed humidified oxygen and continuous KC. Sleep predominated, and neonates were discharged home by 48 hours being fully breastfed, suggesting that KC was an environment conducive to recovery from fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that KC beginning in the delivery room can be given safely and perhaps with benefit to 34-36-week gestation neonates who appear healthy at birth. Kangaroo care was conducive to recovery from birth-related fatigue.

AB  - Rationale: Anxiety during pregnancy has been linked to adverse maternal health outcomes, including postpartum depression (PPD). However, there has been limited study of biological mechanisms underlying behavioral predictors of PPD during pregnancy. Objectives: Considering the shared etiology of chronic stress amongst antenatal behavioral predictors, the primary goal of this pilot study was to examine associations among stress-related physiological factors (including GABA-ergic neurosteroids) and stress-related behavioral indices of anxiety during pregnancy. Methods: Fourteen nulliparous women in their second trimester of a singleton pregnancy underwent speech and mental arithmetic stress, following a 2-week subjective and objective recording of sleep-wake behavior. Results: Lower cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of ALLO + pregnanolone throughout the entire stressor protocol (area under the curve, AUC) were associated with greater negative emotional responses to stress, and lower cortisol AUC was associated with worse sleep quality. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone was associated with greater anxious and depressive symptoms. Stress produced paradoxical reductions in cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of allopregnanolone + pregnanolone, while tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were elevated. Conclusions: These data suggest that cortisol, progesterone, and ALLO + pregnanolone levels in the second trimester of pregnancy are inversely related to negative emotional symptoms, and the negative impact of acute stress challenge appears to exert its effects by reducing these steroids to further promote negative emotional responses.

TI  - Breastfeeding and asthma in children: findings from a West Australian study.
AU  - Oddy WH
T2  - Breastfeeding Review
AB  - The primary aim was to determine whether there was an inverse association between the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the development of traits associated with asthma in children at age six years. A prospective cohort study of children from Western Australia was enrolled prior to birth and followed to age six. Two thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine children were recruited through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at age six allowing for a number of important confounders. These included gender, gestational age, smoking in pregnancy and early child care. After adjustment for confounders, the introduction of milk other than breastmilk before four months of age was a significant (p<0.05) risk factor for all asthma-related outcomes in six-year-old children: (i) doctor diagnosed asthma odds ratio{OR}=1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.54); (ii) wheeze three or more times since the age of one year OR 1.42 (1.15-1.76); (iii) wheeze in the last twelve months OR 1.28 (1.02-1.76); (iv) sleep disturbance due to wheeze within the last twelve months OR 1.41 (1.04-1.90); (v) age at doctor diagnosis (hazard ratio{HR}1.22 {1.03-1.43}); (vi) age at first wheeze (HR 1.36 {1.17-1.59}) and; (vii) positive reaction to common aeroallergens OR 1.27 (1.01-1.59). There is a substantial reduction in risk of childhood asthma as assessed at age six years, if exclusive breastfeeding is continued for at least the first four months of life. These findings are important for our understanding of the aetiology of and for the potential prevention of asthma in children.

TI  - Breastfeeding behavior and related factors in low-income and ethnically diverse mother-infant dyads.
AU  - Doan, Therese Hong-Dung
AB  - Breastfeeding (BF) is a health-promoting behavior and exclusive BF has proven economic and ecologic benefits to individuals and societies. Yet Healthy People 2010 BF objectives for exclusive BF remain unmet and prevalence is lowest for low-income populations. The purpose of this descriptive longitudinal study of 126 predominantly low income and ethnically diverse mother-infant dyads was to compare maternal and infant factors associated with nighttime BF behavior between exclusive BF dyads and supplemented dyads. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, independent t-tests, and Chi-square tests were used for analysis. BF behavior was categorized as either (1) exclusive BF, defined as 100% BF or breastmilk feeding on all three nights, or (2) supplementation, defined as any formula during any of the three nights.Compared to women in supplementation (n=59), women in exclusive BF (n=67) were older, more likely Caucasian, working at 36 weeks pregnant but not working at 1 month postpartum, in a relationship, and getting less help with baby at night. There was no group difference in objective sleep at the last month of pregnancy assessment. At one month postpartum, women in the supplementation group averaged 30 minutes less night sleep compared to women in the exclusive BF group.Compared to infants who were supplemented (n=54), infants who were exclusively breastfed (n=66) were significantly more likely to room-in with mothers in hospital and receive a home visit. They were statistically larger at birth, although the difference in size may not be clinically relevant.Assessment of sleep in new mothers is important for BF maintenance and more effort is needed to promote exclusive BF among younger women, African Americans and women of Asian descent. Rooming-in practice in the hospital after birth should be encouraged, as it was significantly associated with exclusive BF behavior at one month postpartum in this diverse sample of new families. Future research using a qualitative approach would be ideal to discover how nighttime feeding for new mothers evolves over time, their motivation for BF, and their network of influence in support of BF behavior. Findings from qualitative research will be useful in developing an effective intervention for BF maintenance.

TI  - Brief behavioural intervention for infant sleep problems reduces depression in mothers.
AU  - Fisher JRW
T2  - Evidence Based Mental Health
AB  - Question: Does brief behavioural intervention aimed at modification of infant sleep patterns at age 8 months improve maternal depression and child sleep at age 2 years? Patients: 328 mothers reporting infant sleep problems at ageI 7 months. Mothers were recruited to the study when the infant was 4 months old but were only allocated to intervention or usual care if they reported infant sleep problems in a questionnaire administered at 7 months of age. Exclusions: infants born before 32 weeks' gestation; or mother's English too poor to complete self-report questionnaIre. Setting; Well child centres in six government areas (two low, two medIum and two hIghly disadvantaged), Melbourne, Australia. Recruitment October to November 2003. Intervention: Brief behavioural sleep intervention (n = 174) or usual well child care (n = 154). Sleep intervention was delivered by specially trained nurses who taught parents two main strategIes: either 'controlled crymg', where parents respond to the infant's cries at increased time intervals, or 'adult fading', where a parent sits with the infant until they fall asleep then slowly removes this presence over a few weeks. The nurse worked with the mother to develop an individual sleep management plan based on controlled crying, adult fading or simple strategies such as bedtime routine or pacifier use. Outcomes; Primary outcome: maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score community cut-off of >9 or clinical cut-off of > 12). Secondary outcomes: parenting practices (Parent Behaviour Checklist), child mental health (Child Behaviour Checklist) and mother's report of child sleep problems at 2 years or of persistent sleep problems (present at 10, 12 and 24 month assessments). Patient follow-up; Intervention, 82%; usual care, 84%. METHODS Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial (well child centres were the unit of randomisation). Allocation; Concealed. Blinding: Single blind (assessors blinded). Follow-up period: 17 months (until infant was 2 years old) MAIN RESULTS Of the 174 mothers offered the brief behavioural sleep intervention, 100 took up the offer of help. The controlled crying strategy was chosen by 53 families, adult fading by seven families and the remaining 40 families chose simple strategies such as bedtime routine. When the infants were 2 years old, mothers in the brief behavioural intervention group were less likely to report clinical levels of depression than mothers who received usual care (see online table). There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of children reported to have sleep problems at age 2 years (see table), in parenting practices (harsh discipline and nurturing) or in child mental health (externalising and internalising behavioural problems). CONCLUSIONS Brief behavioural strategies aimed at improving sleep patterns in infants with sleep problems can reduce depression in mothers.

AB  - Objective To assess satisfaction with maternity waiting home built spaces and features in women who are at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. residential facilities that temporarily house near-term pregnant mothers close to healthcare facilities that provide obstetrical care). Specifically we wanted to answer the questions: (1) Are built spaces and features associated with maternity waiting home user satisfaction? (2) Can built spaces and features designed to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function improve maternity waiting home user satisfaction? And (3) Which built spaces and features are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction? Design A cross-sectional study comparing satisfaction with standard and non-standard maternity waiting home designs. Between December 2016 and February 2017 we surveyed expectant mothers at two maternity waiting homes that differed in their design of built spaces and features. We used bivariate analyses to assess if built spaces and features were associated with satisfaction. We compared ratings of built spaces and features between the two maternity waiting homes using chi-squares and t -tests to assess if design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function were associated with higher satisfaction. We used exploratory robust regression analysis to examine the relationship between built spaces and features and maternity waiting home satisfaction. Setting Two maternity waiting homes in Malawi, one that incorporated non-standardized design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy, and function (Kasungu maternity waiting home) and the other that had a standard maternity waiting home design (Dowa maternity waiting home). Participants 322 expectant mothers at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. first-time mothers and those with no pregnancy risk factors) who had stayed at the Kasungu or Dowa maternity waiting homes. Findings There were significant differences in ratings of built spaces and features between the two differently designed maternity waiting homes, with the non-standard design having higher ratings for: adequacy of toilets, and ratings of heating/cooling, air and water quality, sanitation, toilets/showers and kitchen facilities, building maintenance, sleep area, private storage space, comfort level, outdoor spaces and overall satisfaction ( p  = <.0001 for all). The final regression model showed that built spaces and features that are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction are toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space ( R 2 = 0.28). Key conclusions and implications for practice The design of maternity waiting home built spaces and features is associated with user satisfaction in women at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes, especially related to toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space. Improving maternity waiting home built spaces and features may offer a promising area for improving maternity waiting home satisfaction and reducing barriers to maternity waiting home use.

A subsample was seen again at the neonatal stage (n = 152), and their infants were observed for sleep-wake behavior. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to caffeine use. Mothers who consumed more caffeine also smoked more often, were younger, were less educated, reported less sleep effectiveness and more obstetric complications. Their newborns were lower birthweight, they spent less time in REM sleep, and they showed more stress behaviors including hiccups, tremors and jerkiness.

AU  - Lee, Kathryn A.

T2  - Research in Nursing & Health
AB  - Postpartum sleep disruption is common among new parents. In this randomized controlled trial we evaluated a modified sleep hygiene intervention for new parents (infant proximity, noise masking, and dim lighting) in anticipation of night-time infant care. Two samples of new mothers (n ¼118 and 122) were randomized to the experimental intervention or attention control, and sleep was assessed in late pregnancy and first 3 months postpartum using actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. The sleep hygiene strategies evaluated did not benefit the more socioeconomically advantaged women or their partners in Sample 1, but did improve postpartum sleep among the less advantaged women of Sample 2. Simple changes to the bedroom environment can improve sleep for new mothers with few resources.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To monitor preterm infants in a cot and a car seat and compare an observed car seat trial with polysomnography (PSG). DESIGN: Non-randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Regional neonatal unit. PATIENTS: Preterm infants before discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Nap PSG respiratory and sleep variables were measured including gastro-oesophageal pH. Nurse observations included respiratory distress, apnoea measured by apnoea alarm, oxygen saturation and heart rate. Infants were studied supine in a cot and then in a car seat. Nursing observations were compared with PSG during the car seat trial only. Criteria for failure of the PSG and observed tests were predefined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in respiratory instability between cot and car seat. Concurrence regarding failure of the car seat trial between nurse-observed data and PSG. RESULTS: 20 infants (median gestation 33 weeks (range 28-35 weeks; median postmenstrual age (PMA) at study 36.5 weeks (range 35-38 weeks)) were studied. There were sufficient car seat data on 18 infants for comparison. There were fewer central apnoeas and arousals in the cot than the car seat (p = 0.047 and p = 0.024, respectively). Airway obstruction was not more common in the car seat. Younger PMA at time of study predicted failure in both car seat (p = 0.022) and cot (p = 0.022). The nurse-observed test had low sensitivity for predicting PSG failure but more accurately predicted airway obstruction on PSG. CONCLUSIONS: Immature infants exhibit respiratory instability in cots and car seats. A car seat test does not accurately detect all adverse events during sleep in the seat.

T2  - Circulation
AB  - Background -- Being born preterm, small, and to a mother who smokes are common perinatal complications with major public health implications. Evidence suggests that each affects the body's structure and function in ways that could increase susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction later in life. Here, we used 2 routine stress reactivity tests to identify incipient 'silent' programming of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with adverse perinatal events.Methods and Results -- We studied 29 control babies born at term to nonsmokers, 18 term-born babies of mothers who smoked throughout pregnancy (mean, 15 cigarettes a day), and 31 babies born preterm to nonsmokers. All infants were compared at the same age after conception (ie, at 40 to 42 weeks), during sleep. We analyzed blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to breathing 4% CO2 for 4 minutes or to passive head-up tilt to 60°. BP was measured continuously from a wrist cuff. CO2 exposure raised heart rate and BP in controls by 10%, and tilt increased their BP by 5%. CO2 elicited the expected BP but no heart rate response from preterm infants but a much-greater-than-expected BP and heart rate response from babies of smokers. Tilt elicited a 3- to 4-fold greater rise in BP from preterm and tobacco-exposed babies.Conclusions -- Vascular, cardiac, and blood pressure reactivity is heightened in babies born preterm or to smokers. The findings are consistent with in utero and early postnatal 'programming' of human cardiovascular dysfunction by adverse circumstances. This incipient dysfunction may be an early manifestation of processes that lead to other problems or complications later on (eg, higher BP or sudden infant death syndrome).

AB  - Preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation die of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at a rate more than double that of term infants. There is a need for SIDS prevention programs tailored to the specific needs of parents of high-risk infants. The purpose of this study was to pilot test an online educational module addressing SIDS risk-reduction recommendations (RRRs) for parents of preterm infants. This study was conducted in a 44-bed transitional care unit at a level IV NICU in the Midwest. A repeated-measures design was used. Two weeks before discharge, mothers completed a survey, addressing knowledge and plans for caring for their baby at home. Mothers then viewed the 5-section Caring about Preemies' Safe Sleep (CaPSS) education module and completed the postmodule evaluation. A discharge survey was completed 4 weeks postdischarge. Fifteen mothers, mean age 26.4 years, participated; 8 (53%) returned the postdischarge survey. Module evaluation rated clarity and completeness of information high. Mothers' ratings of SIDS knowledge were significantly higher after viewing the module (P= .000) and 4 weeks after discharge home (P= .012). Mothers found the use of a pacifier at sleep times to be new information and changed their plans for caring for their infant, with 28.6% of mothers always offering a pacifier before sleep after discharge compared with the 6.7% who had planned to do this before discharge. However, only 71% of infants slept in parents' room after discharge and only 41% were receiving at least some breast milk, which are not consistent with SIDS RRRs.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of certified nurse‐midwives related to sudden infant death syndrome and infant safe sleep. However, this population is an important and trusted source of information for pregnant women and may provide guidance on infant care. We explored these topics with certified nurse‐midwives to identify potential barriers as well as enabling and reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal health care environment. Methods: Participants in this cross‐sectional survey study were certified nurse‐midwives who provide prenatal health care to women in Ohio. Surveys were mailed to all certified nurse‐midwives listed with the licensing registry of the Ohio Board of Nursing (N = 333). Results: A total of 153 eligible respondents completed the survey for a response rate of 55%. Most participants had at least some knowledge of the infant safe sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and two‐thirds had positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. Many participants (61%) perceived that there were barriers to providing prenatal infant safe sleep education, but nearly all (94%) indicated that they were interested in providing this education to their patients. Positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education were predictive of whether they discussed this topic with their patients. Discussion: Certified nurse‐midwives routinely provide guidance on infant care, and it is important that they are familiar with current evidence‐based recommendations on infant safe sleep. They should be supported in their desire to provide infant safe sleep education to their prenatal patients. In addition, efforts should be made to improve attitudes and social norms related to providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment.

AB  - Objective:Sleep complaints are clinically expected in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. We aim to reveal patterns of association among sleep–wake behaviors that are challenging in the life of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods:Through text-mining analyses, we numericized the transcripts of 59 caregiver’s informal, conversational interviews. That is, the relative frequencies-of-occurrences of words as well as their semantic specificities (italic) were clustered, categorized, and visualized for patterns. Results:A total of 4008 words were indexed wheresleeptook the 91st place of most important words.Sleepandwakewere however not associatively conversed throughout the interviews. Sleep-related words conversed were:night, nap, apnea, asleep, awake, bed, bedroom, bedtime, mattress, melatonin, overnight, andwake-up. Among some FASD-characteristic words describing the challenges were:huge, alcohol, manage*, stop, adopt, crazy*. The semantic space reflecting these challenges experienced in caring for children with FASD was divided into two axes: child-oriented vs. other-oriented words, and day-related and night-related words. The position of sleep shows that problematic sleep was expressed as a ‘family’ issue. Clumsy* was interrelated with problematic sleeping and waking. Despite that mostlynightwas associatively conversed, the association ofRoutines,Managing, andPlanningwithsleepunderscores the challenges faced. Conclusion:When conversing caregivers of children with FASD seldom interrelate ‘sleep’ but rather ‘night’ with FASD-characteristics. Increased sleep awareness combined with educational initiatives regarding sleep are advocated.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased inflammatory cytokines are all associated with the risk for postpartum major depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence.Methods: Participants were pregnant women (N=56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores≥15 and clinician interview.Results: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p<.05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (χ(2)=0.98, p=.32).Conclusions: Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted.

AB  - Background:Although incident snoring is common in pregnant women and has been proposed as a potential risk factor for adverse maternalfetal outcomes, the development of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy has not been prospectively described.Methods:Using the Apnea Symptom Score from the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, we prospectively assessed symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and daytime somnolence in 155 women to determine whether symptoms increased during pregnancy and the characteristics associated with increasing symptoms.Results:We found that sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (Apnea Symptom Score, 0.44 (SEM 0.58) vs 0.95 (0.09, P < .001) and the degree of daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 8.6 (0.3) vs 10.2 (0.4), P = .0003) increased significantly during pregnancy. Women with higher baseline body mass indexes and greater increases in neck circumference during pregnancy reported higher apnea symptom scores. Of the 155 subjects, 11.4% reported an increase in Apnea Symptom Score of 2 units or more, consistent with a clinically significant increase in symptoms; these women experienced a significantly greater increase in subjective sleepiness than other subjects (P = .03). Excessive daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10) was prevalent throughout pregnancy (31.0%-45.5%).Conclusions:Our data demonstrate that symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing increase during pregnancy and that more than 10% of our subjects may be at risk for developing sleep apnea during pregnancy. Excessive daytime somnolence was highly prevalent even early in pregnancy and became increasingly common as pregnancy progressed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess frequency, characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and its impact on sleep. METHODS: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen. RESULTS: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week; 45% had an IRLSS >20 and 100% had a PSQI >5. Hemoglobin levels <11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS. CONCLUSION: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy.

T2  - Journal of Pediatrics
AB  - Objective: To determine whether maternal mental health mediates the relationship between eczema or asthma symptoms and mental well-being in children.Study Design: Analysis of 7250 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Child mental well-being at 8 years was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Binary outcomes were high 'internalizing' (anxious/depressive) and 'externalizing' (oppositional/hyperactive) problems (high was >90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were 'none'; 'early onset transient' (infancy/preschool only); 'persistent' (infancy/preschool and at school age); and 'late onset' (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old.Results: Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74, 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep, attenuated these associations. Persistent rash (externalizing: 1.74, 1.40-2.15; internalizing: 1.42, 1.16-1.74) and late onset rash (externalizing: 1.62, 1.17-2.25; internalizing: 1.46, 1.07-1.99) symptoms were associated with poorer mental well-being compared with no rash at any age. Maternal anxiety and depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly for externalizing symptoms. Sleep disruption did not mediate the association.Conclusions: Maternal anxiety and depression may mediate the association between child rash and wheeze and child mental well-being.

AB  - Objective: To explore women's levels of childbirth fear, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and fatigue and their relationships during the third trimester of pregnancy. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a community sample. Participants: Six hundred and fifty English-speaking nulliparous and multiparous women, 17 to 46 years of age and between 35 and 39 weeks gestation, with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell's Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire. Results: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and 20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians. Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted higher levels of childbirth fear among women. Conclusion: One fourth of women reported high childbirth fear. Women's fear of childbirth was related to fatigue, available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of a complex picture of women's emotional experiences during pregnancy.

AB  - Objectives: Childhood abuse is associated with increased risks of adult psychiatric disorders and physical health conditions. Mounting evidence documents associations of childhood abuse with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, to date, no study has evaluated associations of childhood abuse and sleep disturbances among pregnant women.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. To collect information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, history of childhood abuse, and complaints of sleep disturbances, face-to-face interviews were conducted with women in early pregnancy. Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST-S) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-S), translated from English to Spanish, were used to assess stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).Results: Women who experienced any childhood abuse had a 1.65-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.15-2.38) and 2.11-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.35-3.30) as compared with women who reported no abuse. Women who reported both physical and sexual abuse during childhood were more than twice as likely to suffer from stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.44-3.53) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.45-4.09) in comparison to women who reported no childhood abuse.Conclusions: A history of childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. These findings, if replicated, should be used to inform the development of trauma-informed care for such sleep disturbances induced by childhood trauma.

AB  - Background Available evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that childhood maltreatment may be associated with a range of sleep disorders. However, these studies have not controlled for potential individual-, familial- and environmental-level confounders. Aim To determine the association between childhood maltreatment and lower sleep quality after adjusting for potential confounders. Methods Data for the present study were obtained from a pre-birth cohort study of 3778 young adults (52.6% female) of the Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy follow up at a mean age of 20.6 years. The Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy is a prospective Australian pre-birth cohort study of mothers consecutively recruited during their first obstetric clinic visit at Brisbane's Mater Hospital in 1981-1983. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the 21-year follow up. We linked this dataset to agency-recorded substantiated cases of childhood maltreatment. A series of separate logistic regression models was used to test whether childhood maltreatment predicted lower sleep quality after adjustment for selected confounders. Results Substantiated physical abuse significantly predicted lower sleep quality in males. Single and multiple forms of childhood maltreatment, including age of maltreatment and number of substantiations, did not predict lower sleep quality in either gender in both crude and adjusted models. Not being married, living in a residential problem area, cigarette smoking and internalising were significantly associated with lower sleep quality in a fully adjusted model for the male-female combined sample. Conclusions Childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict young adult poor sleep quality, with the exception of physical abuse for males. While childhood maltreatment has been found to predict a range of mental health problems, childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict sleep problems occurring in young adults. Poor sleep quality was accounted for by concurrent social disadvantage, cigarette smoking and internalising.

AB  - Question: What is the relation between acute and chronic life stressors and susceptibility to the common cold? Design: Cohort study in which participants were given a low infectious dose of rhinovirus (type RV39 or Hanks) and quarantined for 1 day before and 5 days after exposure. Setting: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Participants: 276 people (55% women, 81% white) aged 18-55 years who responded to a newspaper advertisement and were free of disease (based on examination and laboratory testing). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, currently lactating, or on regular medication. Assessment of risk factors: Acute and chronic life stressors based on scores from the Bedford College Life Events and Diffculties Schedule. Acute events lasted < 1 month and were a marked or moderate long term threat (eg, getting reprimanded at work). Chronic stressors lasted >/= 1 month, did not end > 6 months before assessment, and were a high moderate or marked long term threat (eg, ongoing unemployment); chronic physical illness stressors were not included. Other variables included health practices (smoking, exercise, sleep habits, alcohol use, and vitamin C and zinc intake), endocrine and immune function, social network ties, personality characteristics, and control variables (age, sex, race, education, body mass, baseline antibody levels, season, and virus type). Main outcome measures: Main outcome was having a cold, based on objective criteria for infection (isolation of virus or changes in serum antibody levels) and illness (mucous weights or mucociliary nasal clearance). Main results: 84% of participants showed evidence of infection, but only 40% had colds. 179 participants (65%) had >/=1 acute event in the previous year and 75 participants (27%) had chronic stressors. Analyses adjusted for control variables showed that participants who had chronic stressors in the previous year were more likely to get colds than those who did not (table); participants who had acute events in the previous year were not more likely to get colds (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 950/0 CI 0.76 to 2.55). Certain health practices (smoking, exercising </= 2 times/wk, poor sleep efficiency, </= 1 alcoholic drink/d, </= 85 mg vitamin C/d), hormone concentrations (increased norepinephrine concentrations), personality factors (introversion), and social network ties (low network diversity) were also associated with an increased risk of colds. The relation between chronic stressors and colds persisted after controlling separately for health practices, endocrine and immune markers, personality, and social network diversity (table). Conclusion: People who had chronic severe life stressors lasting >/= 1 month had increased susceptibility to colds compared with people who did not have chronic life stressors, but people who had acute stressful life events in the previous year did not have increased susceptibility.

T2  - Psychopharmacology
AB  - Introduction: Women of child-bearing age are the population at greatest risk for depression. The stress experienced during pregnancy and the associated antidepressant treatments can both affect fetal development. Fluoxetine (FLX) is among the most common antidepressants used by pregnant women. We have previously demonstrated that perinatal exposure to FLX can alter expression of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Here, we examine the combined effects of maternal stress during pregnancy and perinatal exposure to the antidepressant FLX on the circadian behavior of mice as adults. Methods: Mouse dams were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (embryonic (E) day 7 to E18), FLX (E15 to postnatal day 12), a combination of both stress and FLX, or were left untreated. At 2 months of age, male offspring were placed in recording chambers and circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed. Results: Mice exposed to prenatal stress (PS) had smaller light-induced phase delays. Mice exposed to perinatal FLX required more days to re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance of their light-dark cycle. Mice subjected to either perinatal FLX or to PS had larger light-induced phase advances and smaller phase advances to 8-OH-DPAT. FLX treatment partially reversed the effect of PS on phase shifts to late-night light exposure and to 8-OH-DPAT. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, in mice, perinatal exposure to either FLX, or PS, or their combination, leads to discernible, persistent changes in their circadian systems as adults.

AB  - Introduction: The circadian clock plays an important role in several aspects of female reproductive biology. Evidence linking circadian clock-related genes to pregnancy outcomes has been inconsistent. We sought to examine whether variations in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of circadian clock genes are associated with PA risk. Methods: Maternal blood samples were collected from 470 PA case and 473 controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip platform. We examined 119 SNPs in 13 candidate genes known to control circadian rhythms (e.g., CRY2, ARNTL, and RORA). Univariate and penalized logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios (ORs); and the combined effect of multiple SNPs on PA risk was estimated using a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS). Results: A common SNP in the RORA gene (rs2899663) was associated with a 21% reduced odds of PA (P < 0.05). The odds of PA increased with increasing wGRS (Ptrend < 0.001). The corresponding ORs were 1.00, 1.83, 2.81 and 5.13 across wGRS quartiles. Participants in the highest wGRS quartile had a 5.13-fold (95% confidence interval: 3.21-8.21) higher odds of PA compared to those in the lowest quartile. Although the test for interaction was not significant, the odds of PA was substantially elevated for preeclamptics with the highest wGRS quartile (OR = 14.44, 95%CI: 6.62-31.53) compared to normotensive women in the lowest wGRS quartile. Discussion: Genetic variants in circadian rhythm genes may be associated with PA risk. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings and to further elucidate the pathogenesis of this important obstetrical complication.

AB  - Kisspeptin is an essential gatekeeper of reproductive function. During pregnancy high circulating levels of kisspeptin have been described, however the clear role of this neuropeptide in pregnancy remains unknown. We tested the existence of rhythmic kisspeptin expression in human full-term placenta from healthy pregnant women at six different time points during the day. The data obtained by Western blotting were fitted to a mathematical model (Fourier series), demonstrating, for the first time, the existence of a circadian rhythm in placental kisspeptin expression.

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: Perinatal changes in maternal sleep patterns may modify circadian phase. Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD).Methods: Twelve women (age±SD=26.9±5 years) who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase.Results: Nine women had DLMO phase shifts ≥30 min. On average±SD, new mothers phase delayed 42±80 min (range=163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6.Limitations: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require replication.Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders.

AB  - Pregnancy is a complex and well-regulated temporal event in which several steps are finely orchestrated including implantation, decidualization, placentation, and partum and any temporary alteration has serious effects on fetal and maternal health. Interestingly, alterations of circadian rhythms (i.e., shiftwork) have been correlated with increased risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia. In the last few years evidence is accumulating that the placenta may have a functional circadian system and express the clock genes Bmal1, Per1-2, and Clock. On the other hand, there is evidence that the human placenta synthesizes melatonin, hormone involved in the regulation of the circadian system in other tissues. Moreover, is unknown the role of this local production of melatonin and whether this production have a circadian pattern. Available information indicates that melatonin induces in placenta the expression of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, prevents the injury produced by oxidative stress, and inhibits the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) a gene that in other tissues is controlled by clock genes. In this review we aim to analyze available information regarding clock genes and clock genes controlled genes such as VEGF and the possible role of melatonin synthesis in the placenta.

AB  - Several studies attempted to evaluate the predictive value or the associated risk of several factors only on generic sleep disorders and mainly night-wakings. Aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of biological and historical and clinical factors on the different aspect of sleep behavior and disturbances evaluated by the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Mothers of 1157 children (583 M, 574 F) aged 6.5 to 15.3 years (mean 9.8) completed the SDSC together with a questionnaire on demographic data about family composition, parent's education and professional activities, as well as clinical data about pregnancy, delivery and medical history of the child with specific questions regarding pathologies that could affect sleep; sleep habits of parents and children were also investigated. Global sleep disturbances measured as SDSC total score were affected by cc sleeping, early sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis, asthma and parents' sleep disorders. Early sleep disorders, asthma and parents' sleep disorders had a significant main effect on disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Sleep breathing disorders score was associated with the presence of cosleeping, adenotonsillitis, asthma, food allergy. Disorders of Arousal score was affected by early sleep disorders and parents' sleep disorders. There was a significant main effect of co-sleeping, early sleep disorder, adenotonsillitis, parents' sleep disorder on sleep-wake transition disorders score; of gender, parents' sleep disorder on Disorders of excessive somnolence score and of gender, early sleep disorder and parents' sleep disorder on Sleep hyperhydrosis score. Post-hoc comparisons showed that females vs. males have higher scores in Disorders of excessive somnolence score while males scored higher in Sleep hyperhydrosis score. A visual generalized model revealed that predictors for Total SDSC score are early sleep disorders, parents' sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis and asthma. Our results underline the role of genetic and neurobiological substrate on the development of children sleep, delineating the areas of the sleep that are involved and rising some suggestions on which factors could lead to different later sleep disturbances.

AB  - A 4-year-old girl who had been born of normal pregnancy and delivery and had an unremarkable family or personal history was referred to a neuropsychiatric department because of the appearance of peculiar nocturnal episodes. Parents described that their child abruptly became stiff during sleep. These episodes usually ranged from 20 to 40 seconds, and after that the child continued to sleep. Initially she presented 1 episode per week, but there was a progressive increase in frequency up to 3 to 4 times per night. The child never presented similar episodes while awake. Her examination revealed some café-au-lait spots, congenital microcephaly (3rd centile) and low stature for the age (10th centile). She did not present any neurologic deficit, but she failed to develop an age-appropriate speech, with a delay in the main language milestones.

TI  - CME Certified Symposium Monograph. Special needs of women with bipolar disorder.

AB  - While the prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in women and men, the course of illness tends to be more severe in women. In 50% of women with bipolar disorder, illness onset occurs at or within 1 year of menarche. Despite this pattern, most women with bipolar disorder are not accurately diagnosed until they have had a child and developed an episode of PPD. The occurrence of PPD in a patient with recurrent depression but no history of mania or hypomania should raise the index of suspicion for the presence of an underlying bipolar disorder. Medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder can result in side effects, such as sexual dysfunction or weight gain, and in drug-drug interactions. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills while sodium valproate may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most common cause of menstrual disturbance in women of reproductive age. Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not protect against bipolar disorder relapse. Thus, physicians must be proactive in protecting the mother from relapse. In general, physicians should use nonpharmacologic measures as much as possible, pharmacology when necessary, and consider electroconvulsive therapy when the risks of medications are too great. Psychotic, floridly manic, or profoundly depressed patients should be given medication, for which information concerning safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding exist. For less severe problems, nonpharmacologic strategies can be employed and include promoting the maintenance of healthy nutrition and activity, protecting social and activity/sleep rhythms, educating patients and their families on how to recognize a prodrome of illness, and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address mild symptoms of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the physiological stability and behavioral effects of co-bedding with those of single-bedding premature multiple-gestation infants in incubators as well as the psychological effects on their parents. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, repeated measure. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 16 infants and 8 parents in the co-bedded group, and 21 infants and 11 parents in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: Infants in the study group were co-bedded in incubators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline and posttesting for parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction measures; infant sleep-wake synchronicity; physiological measures; and stress cue measures during baseline and activity. MAIN RESULTS: Repeated measures 5 (time) x 2 (group) analysis of variance found significant differences in infant daily weight, feeding amount, and high-activity heart rate. There was no difference in parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction scores by group, except for higher baseline parental satisfaction scores in the co-bedded group. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the safety of co-bedding multiple-gestation infants in incubators but did not find any significant clinical improvement in infant or parental outcomes with co-bedding. Neonatal intensive-care unit providers should educate staff and parents about the potential benefits of co-bedding and consider developing policies and procedures for co-bedding in both incubators and cribs. Co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants may be provided as an adjunctive developmental care strategy if parents desire this intervention.

T2  - Journal for Healthcare Quality: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare
AB  - This study was part of a large departmental performance improvement initiative to implement and evaluate developmental and family-centered care as 'best practice' in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The goal was to evaluate the safety, effect on infant clinical and developmental outcomes, and maternal satisfaction of co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants compared to traditionally bedded infants/mothers. A secondary purpose was to evaluate co-bedding and American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended 'back to sleep' behaviors in the same infants/mothers after discharge. A retrospective, comparative, descriptive design was used. Chart reviews and mailed written surveys were used to collect study data. Findings showed no significant differences in demographic variables or clinical and developmental outcomes between the total traditionally bedded and co-bedded groups. All mothers reported positive experiences with the NICU. Co-bedding may promote maternal bonding and has no negative clinical or developmental outcomes. Once policies and education are in place, parents should be offered the option to co-bed multiple-gestation infants in the NICU. There is a performance improvement opportunity regarding the education provided to parents of multiple-gestation infants before discharge on the 'back to sleep' recommendations.

AB  - SYNOPSIS: Sleep was monitored in five primiparous women in a laboratory setting every 2 months during pregnancy and at 1 month postpartum. Only the first 6 hours of sleep were analyzed. As predicted from theory about the restorative function of sleep, deep sleep (stages 3-4, slow-wave, delta sleep) increased significantly during the third trimester compared to the first trimester. No difference was found in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep across time. Wake time was significantly higher at the postpartum phase compared to the first trimester.

AB  - SYNOPSIS: The purpose of this study was to describe maternal-infant bonding in homeless parenting adolescents who were participating in a residential program for homeless pregnant and parenting adolescents and their infants. The Capable Adolescent Mothers (CAM) program is focused on helping adolescents who plan to keep and raise their children, who show a readiness for taking responsibility, and who are currently drug free to become capable in parenting skills, life skills, and job skills. Seventeen primarily African-American (n = 11) adolescents between the ages of 15 and 18 years, were videotaped during 34 infant-feeding episodes. The videotapes were analyzed using Barnard's Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale and compared to a national normative sample (NCAST scores). The CAM group scores (41.9) compared favorably to the NCAST scores (41.6) on the parent scale (sensitivity to cues, response to distress, social-emotional, and cognitive growth fostering). The CAM group child scores (clarity of cues, responsiveness to parent) were significantly lower than the NCAST group's scores, probably reflecting the expected lower response scores for infants compared to older children. The author also described the three adolescents who had low total scores and the three who had high total scores. Additionally, as a group, the adolescents did not seem to have a good sense of time; they had not developed routine times for feeding, sleep, and play.

T2  - AWHONN's Women's Health Nursing Scan
AB  - SYNOPSIS: The purpose of this study was to examine the safety of providing mothers 'kangaroo care' (skin-to-skin contact) with their premature infants and to measure maternal emotional reactions to this care. The convenience sample consisted of eight mother-infant pairs. At the initiation of the study, the infants ranged from 1,250 to 1,750 g, were born at 24 to 32 weeks gestation, were not on ventilator assistance, and were physiologically stable. Mothers spent a minimum of 4 hours each day holding their infants upright between their breasts, skin-to-skin. Physiologic monitoring demonstrated no significant changes in apnea, heart rate, or oxygen saturation during these sessions. Time spent in sleep and skin temperature were lower for the infant during kangaroo care but changes were not deemed clinically significant. The cognitive adaptation framework used to categorize maternal responses identified common expressions of helplessness, lack of control, and guilt during the first week after delivery. All mothers experienced an emotional crisis during the second week. By Week 3, mothers expressed increased comfort and control over their environment. All mothers reported that the experience of kangaroo care helped them to gain a sense of control and competency. The authors concluded that skin-to-skin contact activated a process of reconciliation and healing. [Original article accession number: 1993163240 (research, tables/charts)]

AB  - Sleep disorders, prevalent in industrialized countries, are associated with adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose, depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well-being. This focused review of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep disorders of interest: breathing-related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies.

AB  - The effects of comorbid depression and anxiety were compared to the effects of depression alone and anxiety alone on pregnancy mood states and biochemistry and on neonatal outcomes in a large multi-ethnic sample. At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone.

AB  - Objective: To compare self-reported safe sleep data from a community social service agency and primary care centers. Design, Settings, and Participants: Cross-sectional Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)–based survey data from a community social service agency and survey data from primary care centers were compared using descriptive statistics. There were 166 community survey respondents, average age of 25 years (SD = 5.4 years), and 79 primary care center respondents, average age of 24 years (SD = 5.4 years). Two binary logistic regressions were performed to examine the association between demographic differences and safe sleep position/bed sharing. Results: Safe sleep position responses did not differ significantly between the community-based (n = 126, 85%) and primary care center–based (n = 62, 79%) samples, χ2(1) = 0.79, P = .372. Reported bed sharing was significantly higher in the community sample (n = 54, 36%) than the health care center sample (n = 4, 5%), Fisher’s exact test, P< .001. Black race was determined to be significantly associated with increased unsafe sleep positioning (OR = 2.86, P = .022). The community center cohort was the only significant predictor of bed sharing (OR = 25.40, P = .002). Conclusion:Differences in reported safe sleep environments may be due to knowledge variances of safe sleep guidelines, or clinic-based respondents may have been more likely to provide socially desirable responses. The comparison data further highlight the need for continued targeted effort to improve safe sleep behaviors to improve infant health outcomes.

AB  - Background: This study was designed to compare the effects of fluoxetine and imipramine on fasting blood glucose (FBG) in patients with major depressive disorder.Methods: Non-diabetic patients, with major depressive disorder (based on DSM-IV criteria) entered this randomized, double-blind study. Patients did not receive any medication affecting serum FBG levels at least for 2 weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Patients were assigned to receive 20 to 40 mg/day of fluoxetine or 75 to 200 mg/day of imipramine for 8 weeks. Benzodiazepines were allowed when needed for anxiety, agitation or sleep. Pregnant women, and patients with diabetes mellitus, and history of major heart diseases were excluded from this study. Additionally, none of the patients should have received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within 6 months prior to initiation of the antidepressants. FBG levels were measured at the initiation of study as well as 4 and 8 weeks after starting antidepressants.Results: Nineteen patients in the fluoxetine and 24 patients in the imipramine groups completed the study. In the fluoxetine group, FBG level was decreased from 88.5 mg/dL (baseline) to 85.0 mg/dL at week 4 (P=0.73), and to 79.8mg/dL at week 8 (P<0.001). On the other hand, in the imipramine group, FBG level was increased from 86.96 mg/dL (baseline) to 89.71 mg/dL at week 4 (P=0.079), and to 96.90 mg/dL at week 8 (P<0.001).Conclusion: This 8-weeks study showed that FBG levels may decrease in depressive patients receiving fluoxetine and may increase in those patients treated with imipramine. Therefore, it is suggested to measure and monitor FBG before initiation and during treatment with fluoxetine and imipramine. This abstract was translated into English by the publisher or author.

AB  - Background: Quality of sleep disorder is a common problem during pregnancy. Training based on continuous care model and telehealth has improved the quality of health care and may also ameliorate quality of sleep. Aim: The present study was conducted to compare the effects of training on the quality of sleep in pregnant women on the basis of continuous care model and telehealth. Method: This three-group clinical trial was performed in 2017 on 91 pregnant women visiting health centers in Mashhad, Iran. Orientation, sensitization, control and evaluation were carried out in the continuous care group, and four DVDs were watched by mothers in the telehealth group over the course of four weeks along with eight weeks of follow-up, and the routine care of health centers was administered for the control group. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was completed at the end of weeks 8 and 12 after the start of the study. Data were analyzed in SPSS version 24 using Kruskal-Wallis statistical test. Results: The three groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables (P<0.05). The Kruskal-Wallis test results showed that the mean quality of sleep score before the intervention was homogeneous among the three groups (P=0.42), but it was significantly different (P<0.001) immediately after the intervention in the three groups of continuous care (4.4±1.7), telehealth (4.4±1.4), and control (9.0±3.7), and there was a significant difference four weeks post-intervention in the three groups of continuous care (3.5±2.1), telehealth (5.3±1.8), and control (10.7±3.1) (P<0.001). Implications for Practice: Training based on the continuous care model and telehealth can improve the quality of sleep in pregnant women. Considering that telehealth is a simpler and easier method, it can be used to boost the quality of sleep in pregnant women.

AB  - Pregnancy is accompanied by several haemodynamic, biochemical and haematological changes, which may lead to severe problems, if they are not suitably addressed. The current study highlights the haematological and biochemical differences observed in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida (NAP), in the 2nd trimester, in a north Indian population. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the body weight and body temperature of NAP compared with AP. A significant decrease (p < 0.001) in haematological parameters including haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count, MCH and MCHC, was observed in AP; however, MCV was found to be significantly higher (p = 0.038). Many biochemical parameters viz. potassium, albumin, total protein and calcium levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in AP, except alkaline phosphatase whose level was found significantly increased (p < 0.01). The findings of the study suggest that haematological and biochemical changes take place in anaemia during pregnancy. Further, the results obtained should be used for establishing normative values for similar populations.

AB  - Objectives: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep, including habitual snoring and insomnia. The co-occurrence among non-pregnant cohorts is 30%-50% with increased risk for adverse health outcomes. To date, no study has examined the comorbid status or impact in pregnant women.Methods: The prevalence of insomnia (INS) and habitual snoring (HS) were examined in 439 women in the third trimester (34.1 ± 3.7 weeks). Habitual snoring (snoring ≥3 times/week) was self-reported. Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ).Results: Four groups emerged: HS-/ISQ- (n = 161; 36.7%), HS-/ISQ+ (n = 146; 33.3%), HS+/ISQ- (n = 63; 14.4%), and HS+/ISQ+ (n = 69; 15.7%). Logistic regression models revealed both independent associations, as well as comorbid HS/INS status with excessive daytime sleepiness (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.3-6.5, p < 0.001; aOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.4, p = 0.02; aOR 7.2, 95%CI 3.7-14.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Only comorbid HS/INS was associated with gestational hypertension (aOR 3.2 95%CI 1.0-10.6, p = 0.048). Insomnia alone and HS alone were associated with a baby born large for gestational age (aOR 2.9 95%CI 1.2-7.1, p = 0.019 and aOR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11.1, p = 0.034 respectively) but however, the comorbid state was not significantly associated with LGA. Only women with HS alone were at increased odds of having an unplanned cesarean section (aOR 2.2 95%CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.046).Conclusions: Both insomnia alone and comorbid insomnia/habitual snoring were associated with adverse outcomes even after accounting for confounders. These findings are clinically relevant since adverse pregnancy outcomes may have severe consequences for both mother and baby. In order to mitigate these outcomes, identifying viable treatment(s) for women at risk should be considered a high priority.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Connexin hemichannels can open during ischemia, resulting in loss of membrane potential, calcium influx, and release of glutamate. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may contribute to delayed evolution of injury. METHODS: We infused a mimetic peptide that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 ± 1 days gestation (term is 147 days), starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7 days later. RESULTS: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from -13 ± 1.9dB (n = 7) after ischemia-vehicle to -9 ± 1.6dB (n = 7) after ischemia-short infusion and -5 ± 1.6dB after ischemia-long infusion (n = 6, p < 0.05). Peptide infusion was associated with reduced seizure activity after ischemia, less frequent status epilepticus (p < 0.05), and earlier return of sleep state cycling (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion (but not ischemia-short infusion) was associated with improved survival of oligodendrocytes in intragyral and periventricular white matter (p < 0.05) and increased brain weight (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion was associated with an intermediate estimate of surviving neurons in the parasagittal cortex of 2.9 ± 0.8 x 10(6) , in comparison to sham control (4.3 ± 0.9 x 10(6) ) or ischemia-vehicle (1.5 ± 0.4 x 10(6) ; p < 0.05 vs sham control). INTERPRETATION: These data support the hypothesis that opening of connexin hemichannels is a significant mediator of postischemic white and gray matter dysfunction and injury.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is common during pregnancy, affecting approximately one in five pregnant women in Western countries. Many report moderate or severe symptoms and negative impact on sleep. There is very little information in the medical literature for practitioners on the management of this condition during pregnancy. Accordingly, a task force was chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. A committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12 consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including reassurance, exercise and avoidance of exacerbating factors, are outlined. A rationale for iron supplementation is presented. Medications for RLS/WED are risk/benefit rated for use during pregnancy and lactation. A few are rated "may be considered" when RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches. An algorithm summarizes the recommendations. These guidelines are intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research.

T2  - Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice & Policy
AB  - Objective: Research has demonstrated that exposure to violence and adversity has negative effects on both mental health and biobehavioral outcomes, such as sleep health. Research examining the relationship between past and recent violence exposure and mental health suggests that the effects of childhood adversity are especially pernicious, but to date, no studies have attempted to disentangle the direct, indirect and relative effects of past year versus childhood exposure to violence and adversity on sleep. The objective of the current study was to examine the direct effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and past year intimate partner violence (IPV) on different aspects of sleep health in pregnant women. Method: A sample of high-risk pregnant women (n = 101) were interviewed. Mediation analysis with bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals was used to evaluate direct and indirect effects. Results: Findings indicated that while ACEs had significant direct effects on mental health, past year IPV had stronger effects on sleep quality, latency, and efficiency. ACEs did, however, indirectly affect subjective sleep quality via past year psychological IPV. Conclusion: These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may be a regulatory stress response that is most clearly linked to past year violence and trauma. That is, though long-term sleep disturbance may be evident following childhood adversity, it is likely that this relationship is better explained by the role of childhood adversity in predicting adulthood revictimization or due to long-term mental health difficulties associated with early trauma.

AB  - Highlights • Key content was identified to share with expectant fathers during maternity care. • Key content relates to infant and partner support. • Additional content relates to planning/participating in birth and father support. • This shared content can benefit all members of the family triad. Abstract Objective To examine whether there is a consensus on what guidance to share with expectant fathers from the prenatal through early infancy period among a multidisciplinary group of professionals with expertise on father involvement. Design Consensus-building approach using mixed methods involving two rounds of data collection. In Round 1, participants were requested to individually generate content as text messages to share with expectant fathers that a father should know or do for his infant, his partner, and himself starting prenatally and through early infancy. A content analysis of Round 1 data was conducted to identify domain content to share with fathers. During Round 2, experts were asked to rate their perceived level of importance of the content generated in Round 1. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means, and standard deviations were calculated for Round 2. Setting Electronic survey. Participants Nine multidisciplinary professionals with expertise on father involvement, representing psychology, pediatrics, nursing/midwifery, and sociology. Measurements and findings During Round 1, participants individually generated 302 message content items across domains in the following contexts: plan for/participate in birth (n = 71); his infant (n = 95); his partner (n = 107); and himself (n = 38). During Round 2, participants achieved greatest consensus in more content items in two contexts: infant support and partner support. For infant support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with for fathers included: knowledge about signs of infant illness, feeding, sleep patterns, and impact of second hand smoke/drug use; training on providing newborn care; and taking action including participating in infant care, providing verbal stimulation, engaging in age-appropriate play and physical contact, supporting safe sleep, and making/attending doctor appointments. For partner support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with fathers included: communicating with partners with regular check-ins, and about parenting styles and shared responsibilities, signs/symptoms of maternal depression, and hopes/dreams for infant; and taking actions to support partner's physical and emotional health and breastfeeding. Although less content was generated in the other two contexts - plan for/participate in birth and father support - participants achieved consensus on some content in these domains as being important to share with fathers. Key conclusions Despite lack of professional guidelines for expectant fathers, experts generally agreed on the content that should be shared with expectant fathers from pregnancy through early infancy, especially in the domains of infant support and partner support. Implications for practice This study can assist clinicians and practitioners on guidance to share with expectant fathers during their partner's pregnancy and the early postnatal period. Dissemination of such guidance to fathers can assist in benefiting all members of the family.

T2  - Journal of Women's Health (15409996)
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Factors associated with weight gain during pregnancy that may be linked to maternal overweight and obesity were examined. METHODS: In this observational study, 144 women reported on demographics, (prepregnancy) body weight, and lifestyles in self-reported questionnaires at 30 weeks gestation. Body weight at the end of pregnancy (self-reported at 6 weeks postpartum) was used to determine total gestational weight gain. Multivariate prediction models were developed to identify factors associated with total gestational weight gain and excessive gestational weight gain (i.e., higher weight gain than recommended by the Institute of Medicine). RESULTS: Women gained 14.4 (+/-5.0) kg during pregnancy. Obese women gained almost 4 kg less than normal weight women. Pregnant women judging themselves to be less physically active or women who reported increased food intakes during pregnancy gained significantly more weight. Over one third of women (38%) gained more weight than recommended. Being overweight, judging yourself to be less physically active than others, and a perceived elevated food intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with excessive weight gain (odds ratio [OR] = 6.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01-19.32; OR = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.55l, 10.15; and OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.36, respectively). A higher age at menarche and hours of sleep reduced the odds for excessive weight gain (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; and OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mean hours of sleep, perceived physical activity, and measures of food intake at 30 weeks gestation were identified as modifiable behavioral correlates for excessive gestational weight gain. Strategies to optimize gestational weight gain need to be explored, with a focus on the identified factors.

AB  - Background and Aims: The ideal cardiovascular health (iCVH) construct consists of 4 health behaviors (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and diet) and 3 health factors (total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting glucose). A greater number of iCVH components in adolescence are related to better cardiovascular health, but little is known about the correlates of iCVH in adolescents. Thus, the aim of the study was to examine correlates of iCVH in European adolescents.Methods and Results: The study comprised 637 European adolescents with complete iCVH data. Participants were part of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, a cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted in 9 different European countries. Correlates investigated were sex and age, family affluence scale, maternal education, geographic location, sleep time, television viewing, duration of pregnancy, birth weight and breastfeeding. Younger adolescents, those whose mothers had medium/high education or those who watched television less than 2 h per day had a greater number of iCVH components compared to those who were older, had a mother with low education or watched television 2 h or more daily (P ≤ 0.01).Conclusion: Since in our study older adolescents had worse iCVH than younger adolescents, early promotion of cardiovascular health may be important. Future studies may also investigate the usefulness of limiting television viewing to promote iCVH. Finally, since adolescents of mothers with low education had poorer iCVH, it may be of special interest to tailor public health promotion to adolescents from families with low socioeconomic status.

TI  - Correlates of mother-infant interaction and self-regulation in a perinatal intervention program.
AU  - Fehringer KA
AB  - The purposes of this study are to investigate whether the number of nurse home visits during pregnancy and the early postnatal period is related to mother-infant interactions and infant's patterns of self-regulation, whether these interactions change over the course of the first six weeks of life, and if demographic variables are related to mother-infant interactions and sleep patterns. A fourth purpose is to learn about the timing and topics for presentation of educational materials, and about support systems during pregnancy.Twenty-three low-income, first time mothers completed the two week feeding and teaching session, using the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST) feeding scale. Nineteen mother-infant dyads completed both the two week and six week feeding observations and the exit interview. Sixteen mothers completed the Sleep Activity Record (SAR).Statistically significant (p < .05) results from the feeding observation are as follows: (a) mothers who had more education had a higher caregiver total score at two weeks and six weeks, (b) infants of mothers with more education had a higher infant total score at two weeks, and (c) the dyad had a higher total contingency (reciprocal interaction) score at two weeks. Mothers in households with higher levels of income had higher contingency scores at 6 weeks, and the change in the contingency score from two to six weeks was positive for mothers with more income. The cluster of positive findings related to the SAR is that infants who had a higher total score at 2 weeks received more feedings at 3-4 weeks.Mothers reported that the medical and health education information of the nurses was valuable during the pregnancy and after the birth of the baby. Mothers appreciated the social support of the nurses and credited them with being an important part of the support network.A larger sample size pooled from multiple sites, a longer time period for intervention and data collection, and serial SAR recordings might yield more significant results. Further investigation into topics covered, the timing of education for pregnant and parenting women, and the role of social supports may provide information to shape policy and funding considerations.

AB  - Background: The socioecological model proposes a wide array of factors that influence behaviours. There is a need to understand salient correlates of these activity behaviours in a specific population. However, few studies identified socio-demographic, behavioural, physical, and psychological correlates of objectively-assessed physical activity and sedentary time in young adults.Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants in the Raine Study (a pregnancy cohort started in 1989). Australian young adults (mean 22.1 years ± SD 0.6) wore Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the hip 24 h/day for seven days to assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (n = 256 women, n = 219 men). Potential correlates were assessed via clinical assessment and questionnaire and included socio-demographic variables (ethnicity, relationship status, work/study status, education, mothers education), health behaviours (food intake, alcohol consumption, smoking status, sleep quality), and physical and psychological health aspects (anthropometrics, diagnosed disorders, mental health, cognitive performance). Backwards elimination (p < 0.2 for retention) with mixed model regressions were used and the gender-stratified analyses were adjusted for demographic variables, waking wear time and number of valid days.Results: Increased time spent in MVPA was associated with: being single (IRR 1.44 vs in a relationship living together, 95%CI: 1.17, 1.77, p = .001) in women; and better sleep quality in men (lower scores better IRR 0.97, 95%CI: 0.93, 1.00). Less time spent sedentary was associated with: lower mother's education (- 32.1 min/day, 95%CI -52.9, 11.3, p = 0.002 for having mother with no university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and smoking (- 44.3 min/day, 95%CI: - 72.8, - 15.9, p = .0002) for women; lower education status (- 32.1 min/day, 95%CI: -59.5, - 4.8, p = 0.021 for having no university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and lower depression scores in men (- 2.0, 95%CI: - 3.5, - 0.4, p = 0.014); more alcoholic drinks per week for women (- 1.9 min/day, 95%CI: -3.1, - 0.6, p = 0.003) and men (- 1.0, 95%CI: -1.8, - 0.3, p = 0.007).Conclusions: Less desirable correlates were associated with positive levels of activity in young Australian adult women and men. Interventions to increase MVPA and decrease sedentary activity in young adults need to specifically consider the life stage of young adults.

AB  - Background: Depression during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal morbidity and mortality, and subsequent possible adverse effects on the cognitive, emotional and behavioral development of the child. The aim of the study was to identify maternal characteristics associated with poor mental health, in a group of overweight/obese pregnant women in nine European countries, and thus, to contribute to better recognition and intervention for maternal depression.Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, baseline data from early pregnancy (< 20 weeks) of the DALI (Vitamin D and Lifestyle Intervention for gestational diabetes mellitus prevention) study were analyzed. Maternal mental health was assessed with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Women were classified as having a low (WHO-5 ≤ 50) or high wellbeing.Results: A total of 735 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of having a low wellbeing was 27.2%, 95% CI [24.0, 30.4]. Multivariate analysis showed independent associations between low wellbeing and European ethnicity, OR = .44, 95% CI [.25, .77], shift work, OR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.11, 2.93], insufficient sleep, OR = 3.30, 95% CI [1.96, 5.55], self-efficacy, OR = .95, 95% CI [.92, .98], social support, OR = .94, 95% CI [.90, .99], and pregnancy-related worries (socioeconomic: OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.02, 1.15]; health: OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.01, 1.11]; relationship: OR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.05, 1.31]).Conclusions: Mental health problems are common in European overweight/obese pregnant women. The identified correlates might help in early recognition and subsequent treatment of poor mental health problems during pregnancy. This is important to reduce the unfavorable effects of poor mental health on pregnancy outcomes.Trial Registration: ISRCTN70595832 , 02.12.2011.

T2  - Contemporary Pediatrics
AB  - A genetic test for trisomy 21-an extra third chromosome 21-can let parents know if their child would be born with Down syndrome. One in 800 to 1,000 babies have Down syndrome, marked by learning disabilities, physical similarities of the face (short neck, wide nose, epicanthic fold to the eyes), and a series of related birth defects such as sleep apnea and congenital heart defects. Yet few human beings seem able to love and be loved more than someone with Down syndrome. These links help parents of children with Down syndrome, and pregnant women, learn more about it.

AB  - Background Sleep disturbances are common in women, especially during pregnancy. Previous studies have confirmed the importance of sleep disturbances as a risk factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the need for screening and treatment of inadequate sleep. These reports, however, did not examine health-related quality of life which may be affected by sleep long before adverse clinical consequences are detectable in women during pregnancy. Objectives To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between sleep and health-related quality of life in pregnant women. Design A prospective observational study. Setting A university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan and participants’ homes. Participants A total of 164 pregnant women completed questionnaires and wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 days each trimester. Methods Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy, subjective sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-12v2 questionnaire across three trimesters. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between sleep and health-related quality of life. Results Sixty-four (39.0%) women consistently had an average sleep efficiency < 85% by actigraphy and 40 (24.4%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score > 5 in all three trimesters. Cross-sectionally, more actigraphic daytime sleep ( p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better physical health-related quality of life in first-trimester pregnant women. Better actigraphic sleep efficiency ( p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in second-trimester pregnant women. Longer actigraphic total nighttime sleep ( p < 0.01) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in third-trimester pregnant women. Longitudinally, first-trimester actigraphic total nighttime sleep ( p < 0.05) and subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) predicted mental health-related quality of life in the second and third trimester. Conclusions Sleep disturbances are a highly prevalent and persistent problem in pregnant women. Adequate sleep is essential for women at all pregnancy stages and improving nocturnal sleep quantity and quality in early gestation is of utmost importance for an optimal health-related quality of life later in pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association among nighttime sleep and daytime napping behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perception of fatigue in pregnant women. DESIGN: A prospective descriptive study with within-subject design. SETTING: A university-affiliated hospital and participants' home environments. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight third trimester nulliparous women completed sleep and depressive symptom questionnaires, wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 consecutive days, and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent association. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mean duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 ± 60.7 min, with 11 (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep < 6 h. Nineteen women (50%) napped > 3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P = 0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention effect.

T2  - Infant & Child Development
AB  - Data from our research are reviewed showing limited attentiveness and responsivity to animate stimuli in newborns of depressed mothers. These include face-voice stimuli of mothers and strangers, newborn cry sounds and instrumental and vocal music. Newborns of depressed mothers are also noted to be less attentive and responsive when presented with inanimate stimuli, including different texture nipples, different temperature nipples and different weight tubes. Potential underlying mechanisms are suggested by research showing negative effects of prenatal depression, elevated prenatal cortisol and lower prenatal dopamine and serotonin on the newborns of depressed mothers. Additional risk factors are explored, including sleep disturbances and other prenatal stressors. Early interventions, including pregnancy massage, massage therapy for infants and demonstration of the Brazelton Assessment, have been noted to enhance the neonates' attentiveness and responsivity to animate and inanimate stimuli. Limitations of these studies are discussed, including the sample being limited to lower SES women who have many other problems that potentially affect newborns. More controlled studies are needed to assess potential mediating factors for the inferior performance of these newborns on perceptual tasks such as limited attentiveness and/or greater arousal as well as longitudinal follow-up studies to determine whether these limited perceptual abilities continue into infancy.

AB  - Pregnant black depressed women were compared to pregnant black non-depressed women on self-report stress measures and cortisol levels at mid and late pregnancy and on neonatal outcomes. The depressed women had higher anxiety, anger, daily hassles, sleep disturbance scores and cortisol levels at both prenatal visits. These higher stress levels may have contributed to the greater incidence of prematurity and low birthweight neonatal outcomes noted in the depressed group, and they may partially explain the higher rate of prematurity and low birthweight among black women.

TI  - Depression increases in women during early to late menopause but decreases after menopause.
AU  - Bosworth HB
T2  - Evidence Based Mental Health
AB  - Is there an association between depression and the transition to menopause?METHODS:Design: Longitudinal prospective cohort study.Follow up period: Four years.Setting: Philadelphia County, USA; timeframe not statedPeople: 436 initially premenopausal women (218 white, 218 African American mean age at endpoint 44.6 years, range 38-52 years) with 22-35 day menstrual cycles, an intact uterus and of least one ovary. Exclusions: psychotropic or hormonal medication, pregnancy, breastfeeding, compromised ovarian function, or substance abuse. Risk factors: Data were collected during six assessments, approximately every 8 months. Trained researchers collected blood samples for hormone assays (obtained between days 2 and 6 of consecutive menstrual cycles); administered a structured interview to assess general health status and behaviour, and the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Major depressive disorder was assessed according to DSM-IV criteria. At each interview, menopausal status was determined. Outcomes: Depressive symptoms (CES-D a cut off score of >/=16 defined high depressive symptoms); MDD; menopausal status determined with the Staging System for Reproductive Aging in Women (premenopausal: regular 22-35 day menstrual cycle; early menopause: change in cycle length by more than a week for two cycles; late menopause: absence of menstruation for 3-11 months; postmenopausal: absence of menstruation for more than 12 months); predictor variables (including hot flashes, sleep pattern, employment status, history of depression, PMS severity).MAIN RESULTS:Data are presented for 76% of the original sample (332 women). 21% of women had a history of depression at baseline. At 4 years, 3% were postmenopausal, 3% in late menopause, 21% in early menopause, and 73% remained premenopausal. Depressive symptoms were more likely during early and late transition to menopause than pre or post menopause. History of depression, severe PMS, and poor sleep increased likelihood of depression in menopausal women (see http://www.ebmentalhealth.com/supplemental for table).CONCLUSIONS:Depression significantly increases in women as they reach menopause but decreases once menopause is complete.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - Pregnancy impacts common symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as energy, appetite, weight change, and sleep and somatic complaints. However, it is not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience.

AB  - Objective: The Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms (LIFE-Moms) Consortium is designed to determine, in pregnant women with overweight or obesity, whether various behavioral and lifestyle interventions reduce excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and subsequent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and obesity in offspring. The design and planning process of the LIFE-Moms Consortium is described.Methods: The LIFE-Moms Consortium is a collaboration among seven clinical centers, a Research Coordinating Unit, and the NIH designed to support each clinical center's conduct of a separate trial of a unique intervention. Specific common measures, procedures, and eligibility criteria are consistent across the seven trials allowing data to be combined in exploratory analyses and/or compared readily.Results: Numerous committees and working groups were created to define common measures and outcomes during pregnancy and through 1 year postpartum, develop Consortium policies, and oversee progress of the trials. The primary outcome for the Consortium is excessive GWG. Secondary outcomes include maternal, neonatal, and infant anthropometric measures, physical activity, sleep, and complications of pregnancy and delivery.Conclusions: A multi-center consortium of independent, lifestyle interventions with common measures and outcomes may enhance the ability to identify promising interventions for improving outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring.

AB  - The design of an early mobile health application (app) prototype to manage interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, a chronic condition characterized by recurrent pain/discomfort in the bladder and pelvic floor, is described. The purpose of this app prototype is to help people who have IC/PBS manage and learn what triggers their symptoms. Another aim of this research was to provide an example of how sex and gender could be included into the design of a health information system. Based on a literature search of common symptoms and challenges faced by people living with IC/PBS, the researcher created an app prototype design including many features: resources for relaxation, mental health, intimacy, pregnancy, and daily life; reminders for appointments, and medication; logs for diet, activity, sleep, pain, menstruation; and a link to a public washroom locator. This prototype will later undergo usability and content evaluation.

AB  - Background: Inspiratory flow limitation is a breathing pattern during sleep caused by upper airway (UA) narrowing that occurs during snoring and various degrees of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Clinical examination of flow limitation relies on identifying patterns of airflow contour, however this process is subjective and lacks physiological evidence of UA narrowing. Our objective is to derive the temporal features of nasal airflow contour that characterize flow limitation. The features that correlate with UA narrowing can be used to develop machine learning classifiers to detect flow limitation with physiological support.Methods: Sixteen healthy adult men underwent full daytime polysomnography where the nasal airflow was recorded. Before and after sleep, we measured UA anatomical parameters including neck circumference (NC) and upper-airway cross-sectional area (UA-XSA). We extracted various temporal features of airflow and investigated their relationships with the UA anatomical parameters.Results: We found that three features were correlated with the anatomical parameters associated with UA narrowing: deviation index vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.67, p = 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.69, p < 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. ΔNC (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) and peak number vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.54, p = 0.04).Conclusions: Temporal features of airflow were associated with UA narrowing. Future studies could utilize the features to develop classifiers to detect flow limitation and assess the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in high-risk populations such as pregnant women and children.

AB  - Purpose: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet few studies are currently available regarding the determinants of sleep quality among pregnant women in China. This study aimed to: (a) calculate the prevalence of sleep disorder during pregnancy, (b) examine the difference in sleep quality among three trimesters, and (c) identify determinants of sleep quality in pregnant women.Materials and Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. Five hundred pregnant women were recruited at the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynecology of two teaching hospitals in central China. Five selfreport questionnaires were used for gathering data, including information of sample characteristics, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), prenatal depression (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)).Results: A total of 454 pregnant women participated in the study between September 2016 and April 2017. Eighty-seven percent pregnant women experienced sleep disorder (PSQI score >5). Poorer global sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, lower sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances were most prevalent during third trimester. The significant contributors to sleep quality for pregnant women were prenatal depression, maternal age, and gestational age.Conclusions: Sleep disorder is very common in pregnant women from China. Depressive symptoms, increased maternal age, and gestational age are determinants of sleep quality. These determinants can assist healthcare professionals in preventative intervention.

T2  - Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are commonly used to screen for sleep apnea in non-pregnant populations. We sought to evaluate the Berlin and ESS in pregnancy and to determine whether an alternative screening approach could better detect sleep apnea in pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women at high risk for sleep apnea (women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) completed a sleep survey composed of the Berlin and ESS, and participated in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted device designed to diagnose sleep apnea, defined as an apnea hypopnea index >= 5. Using multivariable statistics, demographic, clinical, and subjective symptoms that were independently associated with sleep apnea were determined and a prediction rule for the presence of sleep apnea was developed. The predictive capacity of this newly developed system was compared to that of the Berlin and ESS using receiver-operating curve (ROC) statistics. RESULTS: Of the 114 women who participated and had a valid WP100 study, 100 completed the Berlin and 96 the ESS. The Berlin and ESS did not accurately predict sleep apnea in this high-risk pregnancy cohort, with ROC area under the curves (AUC) of 0.54 (p = 0.6) and 0.57 (p = 0.3), respectively. Conversely, a model incorporating frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, age, and body mass index performed significantly better (AUC 0.86, p > 0.001). CONCLUSION: The Berlin and ESS are not appropriate tools to screen for sleep apnea in high-risk pregnant women. Conversely, our four-variable model more accurately predicts sleep apnea in pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: To describe the development of the integrative capacity of the fetal autonomic nervous system (ANS) according to gestational age and emerging behavioral states, assuming that developing integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variability markers. Methods: Magnetocardiograms of 114 healthy fetuses (21-40 weeks of gestation) were recorded. Level of fetal activity (quiet/active sleep) was estimated according to characteristic heart rate patterns. Autocorrelation functions of (i) fetal heart rate and (ii) time patterns of SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal intervals) were calculated and autocorrelation was determined over different time scales. Age and activity related changes were examined using linear regression and non-parametric tests. Results: During pregnancy, autocorrelation increased in fetal heart rate signals and time patterns of SDNN and RMSSD. Short-time correlation (0-20 s) changed between 21 and 31 gestational weeks. Long-time correlation (75-300 s) accelerated later in pregnancy and did not increase in quiet heart rate patterns. Strong state-dependent changes were found with time patterns of SDNN. Conclusions: Emerging integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate fluctuations over increasing time scales. The period from 21 to 31 gestational weeks seems to be critical to ANS development. Increasing long-time correlation is specific to active sleep states.

AB  - Several modifiable pre- and postnatal determinants of childhood overweight are known, but no one has examined how they influence risk of overweight in combination. We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex >or=95th percentile) at age 3. We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child pairs breastfed for <12 m, and 31% of infants slept <12 h/day. Among the 3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model, the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact on prevention of childhood overweight.

AB  - This paper describes the importance of diabetic retinopathy in the loss of visual function. We exposed the most important risk factors, such as diabetes duration, poor metabolic control, pregnancy, puberty, hypertension, poor control of blood lipids, renal disease, and sleep apnea syndrome. We describe the pathogenesis of the disease, small retinal vessel microangiopathies which produce extravasation, edema and ischemia phenomena. We put special emphasis on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its pathogenic importance. They are also described the main clinical symptoms as microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard and soft exudates, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), venous disorders, formation of new vessels and diabetic macular edema (the latter being the most common cause of vision loss). Finally we describe the latest diagnostic techniques and eye treatment, with special emphasis on obesity surgery importance as more important preventive factor to eliminate the predisposing and precipitating disease symptoms.

There are some pieces of evidence linking poorer maternal and neonatal outcome with pregnant patients having OSA. At present, there are inadequate data on which to base fetal or maternal parameters for treatment of OSA, and no evidence that treatment in the short-term impacts maternal or neonatal outcomes.Summary: Further research is needed to help in the detection and treatment of OSA in pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This narrative review describes the differential diagnosis of restless legs syndrome, and provides an overview of the evidence for the associations between RLS and potential comorbidities. Secondary causes of RLS and the characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management strategies for RLS are summarized. Methods: The review began with a comprehensive PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy, obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications. Results and Conclusions: Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the disorder.

T2  - Journal of Nurse-Midwifery
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the differences between primigravidae and multigravidae women in their experience of sleep efficiency, fatigue and vitality, and level of functioning in the third trimester of pregnancy and the first month postpartum. A secondary analysis of a descriptive, longitudinal study was done. A convenience sample of 31 pregnant women was used to test the hypothesis that multigravidae would have significantly higher levels of functioning in the household, increased fatigue, and decreased sleep efficiency and vitality than primigravidae at both phases of the study. Results indicate, however, that primigravidae experienced significantly more disturbed sleep, with sleep efficiency falling from 89.79% in the third trimester to 77.25% postpartum. Multigravidae had only a minor reduction in sleep efficiency from 86.76% in the third trimester to 83.99% postpartum. Although there was no statistically significant difference in level of vitality, primigravidae experienced more fatigue (73.58 +/- 15.22) than multigravidae (64.35 +/- 18.96) at 1 month postpartum. These results suggest that maternal role 'acquisition,' experienced by primigravidae, results in more fatigue and sleep disruption than does maternal role 'expansion.' The significant decrease in sleep efficiency and increase in fatigue in primigravidae after delivery indicate that health care professionals need to provide anticipatory guidance to primigravidae to help smooth the transition from pregnancy to motherhood.

AB  - Background: Neurodevelopmental disorders are increasingly believed to originate from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Current reviews exploring the neurodevelopmental effects of IUGR, however, are mostly based on birthweight, an inadequate proxy.Objective: We aimed to examine the association between IUGR documented in utero, and neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood.Search Strategy: Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published after 1970.Selection Criteria: The analysis included studies that identified IUGR in utero, with follow-up assessments between 1 month and 12 years of age.Data Collection and Analysis: Data was extracted for cognitive, behavioural, language, motor, hearing, vision or sleep outcomes. Studies were summarised separately for children born at <35 and ≥35 weeks gestation.Main Results: Of 28 876 titles identified, 38 were suitable for inclusion. IUGR children born ≥35 weeks gestation scored on average 0.5 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children born <35 weeks of gestation scored approximately 0.7 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution (preferential perfusion of the brain) had more severe neurodevelopmental impairments than those born IUGR alone.Conclusions: IUGR increases the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment during childhood differentially across domains. IUGR children born preterm or with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution are more severely affected.Tweetable Abstract: IUGR is associated with an overall risk for neurodevelopmental delay in a range of neurodevelopmental domains.

AB  - Overweight and obesity (body mass index (BMI) â 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m(2) and BMI â 30 kg/m(2,) respectively are increasingly common among women of reproductive age. Overweight and obesity are known to be associated with many adverse health conditions in the preconception period, during pregnancy and during the labour and postpartum period. There are no current guidelines to suggest which preconception health programs and interventions are of benefit to these women and their infants. It is important to evaluate the available evidence to establish which preconception interventions are of value to this population of women. To evaluate the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions for improving pregnancy outcomes in overweight and obese women. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised controlled trials (including those using a cluster-randomised design), comparing health programs and interventions with routine care in women of reproductive age and a BMI greater then or equal to 25 kg/m(2). Studies published in abstract form only, were not eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised trials or randomised trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. The intervention in such studies would involve an assessment of preconception health and lead to an individualised preconception program addressing any areas of concern for that particular woman.Preconception interventions could involve any or all of: provision of specific information, screening for and treating obesity-related health problems, customised or general dietary and exercise advice, medical or surgical interventions. Medical interventions may include treatment of pre-existing hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance or sleep apnoea. Surgical interventions may include interventions such as bariatric surgery. The comparator was prespecified to be standard preconception advice or no advice/interventions. We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The search identified one study (published in four trial reports) which was independently assessed by two review authors and subsequently excluded. There are no included trials. We found no randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of preconception health programs and interventions in overweight and obese women with the aim of improving pregnancy outcomes. Until the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions can be established, no practice recommendations can be made. Further research is required in this area.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the timing of hospital discharge, time to outpatient follow-up, and home care practices (breastfeeding initiation and continuation, tobacco smoke exposure, supine sleep position) for late-preterm (LPT; 34 0/7-36 6/7 weeks) and early-term (ET; 37 0/7-38/6/7 weeks) infants with term infants. METHODS: We analyzed 2000-2008 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Χ2 Analyses were used to measure differences in maternal and infant characteristics, hospital discharge, outpatient care, and home care among LPT, ET, and term infants. We calculated adjusted risk ratios for the risk of adverse care outcomes among LPT and ET infants compared with term infants. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, LPT infants were less likely to be discharged early compared with term infants, whereas there was no difference for ET infants (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.65 [0.54-0.79]; 0.95 [0.88-1.02]). LPT and ET infants were more likely to have timely outpatient follow-up (1.07 [1.06-1.08]; 1.02 [1.02-1.03]), more likely to experience maternal tobacco smoke exposure (1.09 [1.05-1.14]; 1.08 [1.06-1.11]), less likely to be initially breastfed (0.95 [0.94-0.97]; 0.98 [0.97-0.98]), less likely to be breastfed for ≥10 weeks (0.88 [0.86-0.90]; 0.94 [0.93-0.96]), and less likely to be placed in a supine sleep position (0.95 [0.93-0.97]; 0.97 [0.96-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS: Given that LPT and ET infants bear an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, greater efforts are needed to ensure safe and healthy posthospitalization and home care practices for these vulnerable infants.

AU  - Tayfun F

T2  - Turkiye Klinikleri Journal of Medical Sciences
AB  - In mammals, the vast majority of dietary tryptophan is metabolized via the kynurenine pathway (KP), which is initiated by the oxidative opening of the indole ring and eventually produces the ubiquitous enzyme cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Several neuroactive intermediates are yielded with the degradation of triptophan by this pathway, including the free radical generator 3-hydroxykynurenine, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist quinolinic acid, and the NMDA and -7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist kynurenic acid. The kynurenine pathway may play a role in certain physiological functions such as behaviour, sleep, thermoregulation and pregnancy. Furthermore, the kynurenine pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of cerebral diseases including the AIDS dementia complex, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer, epilepsy, Down syndrome, septicemia-related encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, malaria, and certain inflammatory brain diseases, as well as in traumatic brain injury. New pharmacological agents designed to manipulate concentrations of kynurenine pathway intermediates may prove to be new therapeutic vectors in the treatment of these disorders.

AB  - Background For a small but significant group, pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain may become persistent. While multiple factors may contribute to disability in this group, previous studies have not investigated sleep impairments, body perception or mindfulness as potential factors associated with disability post-partum. Objectives To compare women experiencing no pain post-pregnancy with those experiencing pregnancy-related persistent lumbopelvic pain (either low- or high-level disability) across multiple biopsychosocial domains. Design Cross-sectional. Methods Participants completed questionnaires for thorough profiling of factors thought to be important in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain. Specific measures were the Urinary Distress Inventory, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, Back Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophising Scale, The Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Women where categorised into three groups; pain free (n = 26), mild disability (n = 12) and moderate disability (n = 12) (based on Oswestry Disability Index scores). Non-parametric group comparisons were used to compare groups across the profiling variables. Results Differences were identified for kinesiophobia (p = 0.03), body perception (p = 0.02), sleep quantity (p < 0.01) and sleep adequacy (p = 0.02). Generally subjects in the moderate disability group had more negative findings for these variables. Conclusion Disturbances in body-perception, sleep and elevated kinesiophobia were found in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain subjects with moderate disability, factors previously linked to persistent low back pain. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for identification of directional pathways between factors. The results support the consideration of these factors in the assessment and management of pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain.

AB  - Objective: Disturbed sleep and depression are potential risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health. Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse outcomes.Methods: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n = 168) at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth weight, and peripartum events.Results: Among depressed women, short sleep duration (<7 hours) was associated with higher interleukin (IL)-8 across time (β = 0.506, p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (<85%) was associated with higher IL-6 (β = 0.205, p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor necrosis factor α (β = 0.105, p = .024). Aspects of poor sleep were associated with having a lower weight baby (p values <.053). Among depressed women, interferon-γ increased risk for preterm birth (odds ratio = 1.175, p = .032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (β = 105.2, p = .085), interferon-γ and lower birth weight (β = -19.92, p < .069), and increased IL-8 and babies weighing less than 4000 grams (odds ratio = 0.72, p < .083) were observed.Conclusions: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships.

AB  - The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is an increased reporting of sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence implicating significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, with adverse outcomes, such as an increase in depressive symptomatology or the development postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant, and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD.

AB  - Objective: The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) is likely caused by multiple factors, which may include disturbed sleep. We evaluated whether sleep disturbance was associated with PTB and whether the association was affected by other psychosocial risk factors. Methods: Pregnant women ( n=217) for whom we had depression and sleep data at 20 or 30 weeks gestation and delivery information were evaluated. Logistic models were used to test the hypotheses that disturbed sleep was associated with PTB. Results: Time in bed at 20 weeks was significantly associated with risk for preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.88). However, after controlling for depression/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) status, history of PTB, age, employment, and marital status, this relationship was no longer significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI .92-1.71). No other relationships were significant. Conclusions: We report preliminary evidence suggesting that poor sleep may contribute to risk for PTB. Although it is speculative and additional work is needed to confirm or refute whether sleep is an independent or mediating risk factor for PTB, disturbed sleep does appear to play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Abnormalities of sleep and biological rhythms have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, less is known about the influence of biological rhythm disruptions across the perinatal period on postpartum depression (PPD). The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the relationship between subjective changes in both sleep and biological rhythms and worsening of depressive symptoms from pregnancy to the postpartum period in women with and without mood disorders. Eighty-three participants (38 euthymic women with a history of a mood disorder and 45 healthy controls) were studied. Participants completed subjective assessments of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), biological rhythm disturbances (Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), and depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) prospectively at two time points: third trimester of pregnancy and at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Multivariate regression analyses showed that changes in biological rhythms across the perinatal period predicted worsening of depressive symptoms in both groups. Moreover, women with a history of a mood disorder showed higher levels of sleep and biological rhythm disruption during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. These findings suggest that disruptions in biological rhythms during the perinatal period increase the risk for postpartum mood worsening in healthy pregnant as well as in pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

T2  - Journal of Clinical Nursing
AB  - Aims and objectives. To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background. Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design. Cross-sectional study design. Methods. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results. The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.

AB  - Objective: A number of studies have established an association between antenatal maternal depression and infant sleep. One key question is whether all infants are equally susceptible to environmental influences, including the intrauterine environment. Reactive temperament has been examined as a plasticity factor, with accumulating evidence suggesting that infants with reactive temperament may be more susceptible to both positive and negative environmental influences. This study examines whether infant reactivity moderates any association between antenatal depression and infant sleep in 2 longitudinal studies: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Generation R cohorts.Methods: Maternal depression scores were assessed during pregnancy using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Infant sleep duration and awakenings, in ALSPAC (N = 8318) and Generation R (N = 2241), were assessed at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Infant reactivity was assessed by temperament questionnaire at 6 months of age.Results: Hierarchical linear regression models indicated a 3-way interaction between reactivity and gender moderating the effect of antenatal depression on infant sleep, on sleep duration in Generation R at 24 months (β = .085, p < .001) in the whole sample and when limited to the Dutch/European group (β = .055, p = .030), and on night awakenings at 18 months in ALSPAC (β = -.085, p = .013). Boys with more reactive temperament exhibited shorter sleep duration and a higher number of awakenings when previously exposed to maternal symptoms of antenatal depression.Conclusion: For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.

AB  - Objective:The current study examined the relationship between sleep state development across the preterm and early post-term periods and subsequent growth trajectories from 1 to 27 months corrected age.Study design:Retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively from 111 preterm infants (⩽34 weeks gestation) who participated in a multi-site longitudinal study. Separate longitudinal parallel process models were calculated for each sleep state (active and quiet sleep) and growth (weight, length and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores) variable to estimate the associations between their developmental trajectories.Results:Significant associations were identified between the trajectories of quiet sleep and weight, active sleep and weight, quiet sleep and BMI, and active sleep and BMI. No statistically meaningful associations were identified between the trajectories of early childhood length and the preterm sleep states.Conclusion:Faster preterm period sleep development appears to predict more favorable early childhood growth trajectories, particularly for weight, indicating preterm sleep may be an important biomarker for subsequent growth outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Nocturia is more than an isolated lower urinary tract symptom, being significantly associated with dysfunction of sleep quality and duration, cardiovascular morbidity, mental health and mortality1. The medical conditions co-existing with nocturia may share central neural control areas in the brainstem2,3. The aim of this study was to investigate whether improvement in one comorbid variable, in patients with nocturia, may regulate other co-morbid dysfunctions toward a more normal state. Materials and methods: A prospective, two-arm repeated measures study was performed in 2017. Participants were recruited from both Continence and Sleep Medicine Services. Inclusion criteria included: ≥40 years of age; nocturia; either urinary urgency or urge incontinence (UUI) severe enough to require pharmacotherapy or sleep disordered breathing (SDB) requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Exclusion criteria were current urinary tract infection, end-stage renal disease, bladder cancer, previous pelvic radiotherapy, pregnancy, urinary catheterisation and dementia or cognitive impairment that precluded completion of study tasks. Patients not able to complete questionnaires in English were also excluded from the study. Ethics approval: HREC number LNR/17/ MH/96 Baseline data included demographic information, overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), Nocturia-specific quality of life instrument (NQoL), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Euroquol-5D Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D), 2-day bladder diary variables, actigraphy parameters and blood pressure. Study intervention was either an anticholinergic agent or beta-3 agonist (mirabegron) to treat urgency or urgency incontinence or CPAP to reduce apnoea episodes. Those with SDB were not treated for any urinary tract symptoms; UUI patients did not commenced CPAP therapy during the study. Participants were followed up regularly by their clinician as per usual care. Data were re-collected at 12 weeks. Results: Overall, 36 patients participated (20 continence, 16 sleep medicine), 58% female, mean age of 63 years (SD 12) and health status on EQ-5D of 73/100 (SD 17). Full compliance with intervention was 78% for OAB medication and 55% for CPAP worn at least 4 hours at night. Findings are presented in Table 1. As expected, the OABSS was significantly reduced (p=0.04) in the continence cohort while sleep efficiency and sleep disturbance improved in the SDB arm (p<0.001 and 0.020 respectively). In both arms OABSS and sleep parameters changed significantly, while nocturia frequency significantly reduced in the Continence group and approached a significant difference in the sleep cohort (p=0.07). Specific co-morbid dysfunctions improved. In UUI patients sleep parameters improved significant (p=0.03) and high systolic blood pressure fell (p=0.04). In patients with SDB significant improvement was noted in OABSS (p=0.01), sleep domains (total score p=0.04) night urine production (p<0.01) and nocturia-related QoL (p=0.01). A non-significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was noted. Wellbeing measures did not change in either study group. Conclusions: In a cohort of young, relatively healthy individuals, treatment targeted to the presenting dysfunction resulted in less nocturia, improved sleep quality and duration and a reduction in clinically relevant systolic blood pressure (Continence arm only). There were no significant changes in bladder storage, diuresis or nocturnal polyuria index to explain the findings. Treatment appears to have induced change toward a more normal state in non-urinary variables known to have control areas in the brainstem. Competing interest statement: None.

TI  - Does Tongue Size Contribute to Risk of Airway Narrowing in Preterm Infants Sitting in a Car Safety Seat?
AU  - Tonkin, S. L.

T2  - American Journal of Perinatology
AB  - Background Preterm infants are at risk of narrowing of the upper airway while restrained in infant car seats, leading to secondary apnea. However, some infants are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect relatively smaller tongue size. Methods We retrospectively analyzed previously reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm infants ready for discharge (32.6 ± 1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8 ± 9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an index of relative tongue size. Results A smaller airspace around the tongue (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (p < 0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway size (r2 = 0.16, p = 0.11). Conclusion The present study supports the hypothesis that the vulnerability of preterm infants to airways compromise while restrained in a car safety seat may be in part related to relative tongue size.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if maternal sleeping position around the time of implantation influences eventual placental implantation site. Between November 1997 and April 1999, women with singleton pregnancies between gestational ages of 15 and 20 weeks presenting for ultrasound examinations were prospectively queried regarding their usual position of sleep during early gestation. Dominant position of sleep was noted as prone, supine, right side, or left side. At ultrasound examination, placental location was categorized as (1) fundal, (2) left high, (3) right high, (4) anterior high, (5) posterior high, (6) anterior low, (7) posterior low, (8) right low, (9) left low, or (10) central low. During the 18 months of this study, data were obtained from 1,500 patients. At the time of conception, front or prone sleeping was the most common (497 of 1,500, 33.1%), followed by right side (439 of 1,500, 29.3%) and left side (360 of 1,500, 24%), with the back being the least frequent position of sleep (204 of 1,500, 13.6%). Women who usually slept supine at the time of conception and implantation were significantly more likely to have a high or fundal placental location compared with those who usually slept in the prone position (p = 0.041). In addition, women who slept exclusively on their right side early in pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a right-sided placental location compared with women who slept exclusively on their left side (p = 0.025). The data from this investigation indicate that sleeping position early in gestation may influence the ultimate placental implantation site.

AB  - Introduction: One indicator for fetal risk of mortality is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Whether markers reflecting the impact of growth restriction on the cardiovascular system, computed from a Doppler-derived heart rate signal, would be suitable for its detection antenatally was studied.Material and Methods: We used a cardiotocography archive of 1163 IUGR cases and 1163 healthy controls, matched for gestation and gender. We assessed the discriminative power of short-term variability and long-term variability of the fetal heart rate, computed over episodes of high and low variation aiming to separate growth-restricted fetuses from controls. Metrics characterizing the sleep state distribution within a trace were also considered for inclusion into an IUGR detection model.Results: Significant differences in the risk markers comparing growth-restricted with healthy fetuses were found. When used in a logistic regression classifier, their performance for identifying IUGR was considerably superior before 34 weeks of gestation. Long-term variability in active sleep was superior to short-term variability [area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 72% compared with 71%]. Most predictive was the number of minutes in high variation per hour (AUC of 75%). A multivariate IUGR prediction model improved the AUC to 76%.Conclusion: We suggest that heart rate variability markers together with surrogate information on sleep states can contribute to the detection of early-onset IUGR.

AB  - Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance There is limited evidence about the role of herbal and traditional medicine in pregnancy-related insomnia. Extant documents on traditional Persian medicine refer to many plants which could induce sleep and which were used by pregnant women. In Iran, local herbal shops continue to provide these herbs to pregnant women to treat insomnia. One such herb is Lactuca sativa L. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lettuce seed on pregnant women for the treatment of insomnia. Methods and materials In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 100 pregnant women with insomnia aged 20–45 years were assigned to receive capsules containing 1000 mg of lettuce seed or a placebo daily for two weeks. The main outcome was the quality of sleep, which was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results Each group contained 50 participants. An improvement in the PSQI score was significantly greater in patients receiving lettuce seed than those receiving the placebo. Linear regression analysis showed that, after controlling for the other variables, the average sleep score of the experimental group was significantly lower than for the placebo group (p = 0.03). Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that lettuce seed decreased insomnia during pregnancy and could be recommended as a safe natural remedy for treatment of pregnancy-related insomnia.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the prevalence and phenomenology of dream-associated behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum mothers. Episodes consist of anxious dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion). DESIGN: Three-group design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures. SETTING: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by telephone. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum: n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 +/- 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas); pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 +/- 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age = 28.5 +/- 6.34 years). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects completed questionnaires about pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares, associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%). Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P < 0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%) as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%) (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of dream-associated behaviors. CONCLUSION: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.

AB  - Objective. To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting and subjects. A total of 1765 women were invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11-16 weeks of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use. Main outcome measures. Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors, smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic medicine. Results. Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%). Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p < 0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with multiparity. Conclusions. Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting.

TI  - Drugs for preventing malaria in pregnant women in endemic areas: any drug regimen versus placebo or no treatment.
AU  - Garner P
AU  - Gülmezoglu AM
T2  - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria and this is associated with poor health outcomes for both the mother and the infant, especially during the first or second pregnancy. To reduce these effects, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas sleep under insecticide-treated bednets, are treated for malaria illness and anaemia, and receive chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial drug during the second and third trimesters. To assess the effects of malaria chemoprevention given to pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas on substantive maternal and infant health outcomes. We also summarised the effects of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone, and preventive regimens for Plasmodium vivax. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists up to 1 June 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any antimalarial drug regimen for preventing malaria in pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas compared to placebo or no intervention. In the mother, we sought outcomes that included mortality, severe anaemia, and severe malaria; anaemia, haemoglobin values, and malaria episodes; indicators of malaria infection, and adverse events. In the baby, we sought foetal loss, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality; preterm birth and birthweight measures; and indicators of malaria infection. We included regimens that were known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time but may no longer be used because of parasite drug resistance. Two review authors applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD); both are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Seventeen trials enrolling 14,481 pregnant women met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and Thailand (two trials). Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo or no intervention; chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), and mefloquine (weekly), or intermittent preventive therapy with SP (given twice, three times or monthly). Trials recruited women in their first or second pregnancy (eight trials); only multigravid women (one trial); or all women (eight trials). Only six trials had adequate allocation concealment.For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate to severe anaemia by around 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, high quality evidence), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials,, 3662 participants, high quality evidence). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by around 61% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; seven trials, 3663 participants, high quality evidence), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (low quality evidence). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (very low quality evidence).For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (MD 92.72 g, 95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, moderate quality evidence), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; eight trials, 3619 participants, moderate quality evidence), and reduces placental parasitaemia by around 46% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69; seven trials, 2830 participants, high quality evidence). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses were underpowered to detect clinically important differences.In multigravid women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; three trials, 977 participants, high quality evidence)but there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes.In trials giving chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia (defined by authors, but at least < 8 g/L: RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two trials, 1327 participants, low quality evidence), but consistent benefits have not been shown for other outcomes.In an analysis confined only to intermittent preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the evidence were similar.A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis against P. vivax showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20; one trial, 942 participants). Routine chemoprevention to prevent malaria and its consequences has been extensively tested in RCTs, with clinically important benefits on anaemia and parasitaemia in the mother, and on birthweight in infants.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

TI  - Early kangaroo care for 34--36 week preterm infants: Effects on temperature, weight, behavior, and acuity.
AU  - Chwo M
AB  - Preterm infants are routinely placed in incubators immediately after birth in Taiwan. Mothers can be with their infants only during scheduled visiting times in the nursery. However, some health professionals propose that infants are at increased physiological and developmental risk if on-cue self-regulatory access to their mothers is not provided. Kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care may be nurturing for medically stable, lower-risk preterm infants because it supports their efforts toward self-regulation and competent functioning (Anderson, 1999). This randomized controlled trial was done to test the hypotheses that infants given kangaroo care (KC) would have higher tympanic core temperature, less weight loss, more optimal behavioral state, and lower acuity.Thirty-four healthy preterm infants and their mothers were selected from Chung Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Maternal inclusion criteria were no pre-existing medical problems, willingness to breastfeed, and no problems that would keep the mother from the nursery. Infant inclusion criteria were 34-36 completed weeks gestation, 5-minute Apgar score <=7, stable respirations, and admission to the normal newborn or observation nursery.Eligible dyads were recruited after birth (Day 0). On Day 1 they were randomly assigned by minimization just before the first study feeding to the control (n = 17) or KC group (n = 17). Stratification variables were gender, birth weight, delivery method, and parity. On Days 1 and 2, control infants wore a shirt and diaper, were wrapped in a blanket, and held by their mothers for one hour, three times a day at scheduled feeding times; KC infants wore a diaper and were held upright skin-to-skin on their mothers' chest except during breastfeeding.Hypothesis testing was done using repeated measures analysis of variance and independent sample t-tests. KC infants compared to control infants had higher mean tympanic temperature (37.3 degrees]C vs. 37.0 degrees]C), more quiet sleep (62% vs. 22%), more inactive awake behavior (14% vs. 7%), less drowsiness (2% vs. 15%), and less crying (2% vs. 6%) all at p = .000. No significant difference was found for weight loss and acuity (length of hospital stay).These findings can be used for evidence-based nursing practice in Taiwan. This is the first randomized controlled trial to provide information about the effect of early KC on tympanic temperature, weight loss, behavioral state, and acuity for 34-36 week gestation preterm infants in Taiwan. KC as given in this study is a safe intervention.

T2  - Early Postpartum Depression Screening
AB  - In Hawai.i, postpartum depression (PPD) has a prevalence rate of 14 to 15 percent, affecting about 3,000 women annually (Hayes, Shor, & Fuddy, 2010). Postpartum depression is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) as a "Major depressive condition that occurs in the one year period following childbirth" (Grier & Geraghty, 2015, p. 110). After delivery, women with PPD experience feelings of sadness, loneliness, or inadequacies daily for at least two weeks. Additional symptoms include erratic sleep patterns, anxiety, or the inability to care for oneself or the newborn infant. In the Kaiser Permanente (KP) organization, postpartum depression screening occurs in the antepartum (third trimester) during pregnancy and repeated during the routine four to six week postpartum visit. This project implemented a validated depression-screening tool between one to three days post hospital discharge at the KP Special Delivery Program clinics. The goal was to screen for early postpartum depressive symptoms, and if detected, initiating an immediate referral to the KP Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. There is no current screening program for depressive symptoms during the early postpartum period in the KP Hawai.i region.

AB  - Background: Preterm delivery may affect the development of the upper airways resulting in a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We investigated whether children born at early term (37-38 6/7 weeks' gestation) are at an increased risk for childhood OSA as compared with those born later.Methods: In this population-based cohort analysis all singleton deliveries occurring between 1991-2013 at a single regional tertiary medical centre were included. Gestational age upon delivery was sub-divided into: early preterm (<33 6/7 weeks' gestation), late preterm (34-36 6/7), early term, full term (39-40 6/7), late term (41-41 6/7), and post term (>42 0/7). Incidence of OSA related hospitalizations of the offspring, up to the age of 18 years, was evaluated. A survival curve and a Cox model were used to assess the association.Results: During the study period 240 953 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. OSA hospitalization (n = 1320) rates decreased as gestational age increased from 1.1% in the early preterm group, 0.8% in late preterm, 0.7% at early term, 0.5% in full term, 0.4% in late term, to 0.3% in post term born children. In the Cox regression, early term delivery exhibited an increased risk for paediatric OSA (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.3 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.5) while late and post term deliveries were associated with significantly lower OSA risk when compared with full term (HR 0.8 95% CI 0.6, 0.9 and HR 0.6 95% CI 0.4, 0.8, respectively).Conclusions: Early term deliveries are associated with higher rates of paediatric OSA, which decrease gradually as gestational age advances.

TI  - Economic antecedents of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers.
AU  - Bruckner TA
T2  - Annals of Epidemiology
AB  - Purpose: Black infants die from sudden infant death syndrome at twice the incidence observed among non-Hispanic white infants. Explanations for this disparity include a two-fold greater prevalence of prone (i.e., stomach) infant sleep placement among black caregivers. I test the hypothesis that the contraction of state economies may contribute to this disparity by increasing the risk of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers.Methods: I retrieved data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment series and 33,518 black mothers in 26 states participating in the 1996-2002 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. I use weighted multivariable analyses to control for individual characteristics and state and time trends.Results: Black mothers exhibit an elevated risk of reporting prone placement one month following statewide declines in employment (adjusted odds ratio for a one percent decline = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22). This risk remains elevated after control for individual variables. In contrast, I find no association between the economy and prone placement among white mothers.Conclusions: Statewide economic decline may reduce adherence to the recommended non-prone infant sleep position among black, but not white, mothers. Additional research among black caregivers should determine which mechanisms connect economic downturns to prone infant sleep placement.

AB  - <italic>Objectives</italic> Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked with ill-health in adulthood, but ACE literature has focused on family disruption or dysfunction (e.g., child abuse, parental separation), with less attention to economic adversity. We examined whether a mother’s economic hardship in childhood (EHC) was associated with women’s hardships and health-risk behaviors during/just before pregnancy. <italic>Methods</italic> We analyzed population-based survey data on 27,102 postpartum California women. EHC included respondents’ reports that during childhood they/their families experienced hunger because of inability to afford food or moved because of problems paying rent/mortgage and the frequency of difficulty paying for basic needs. We examined six maternal hardships/behaviors during/just before pregnancy, including four hardships (poverty, food insecurity, homelessness/no regular place to sleep, intimate partner violence) and two behaviors (smoking, binge drinking). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated from sequential logistic regression models estimating associations between EHC (categorized by level of hardship) and each maternal hardship/behavior, first without adjustment, then adjusting for other childhood and current maternal factors, and finally adding family disruption/dysfunction. <italic>Results</italic> Before adjustment for family disruption/dysfunction, the highest and intermediate EHC levels were associated with each maternal hardship/behavior; after full adjustment, those associations persisted except with smoking. Higher EHC levels generally appeared associated with larger PRs, although confidence intervals overlapped. <italic>Conclusions for Policy/Practice</italic> These findings link childhood economic hardship with women’s hardships, binge drinking, and possibly smoking around the time of pregnancy. Without establishing causality, they support previous research indicating that childhood economic adversity should be considered an ACE.

AB  - Since poor sleep quality is associated with multiple health problems, it is important to understand factors that may affect sleep patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a continuous, 60-Hz, nighttime magnetic field exposure on sleep outcomes in young women sleeping at home. The study was a randomized crossover trial, comparing intervention (0.5-1.0 micro T above ambient levels) with ambient magnetic field levels, during two 5-night measurement periods. Subjects lived in the Seattle, Washington, area and were 20-40 years of age, had regular menstrual cycles, were not taking oral contraceptives, and had not breastfed or been pregnant during the previous year. The study was conducted between March and September of 2001. Sleep outcomes were measured via actigraphy. The range of magnetic field exposure was 0.001-0.50 micro T during the ambient period and 0.41-1.21 micro T during the intervention period. Sleep outcomes were not significantly different between the intervention and the ambient measurement periods. The intervention magnetic field had no effect on sleep patterns, suggesting that this exposure may not be an important factor in predicting sleep of young women who sleep at home.

AB  - Sleep disturbance and fatigue are frequent complaints during pregnancy and postpartum. We assessed the effectiveness of Lavender cream and footbath on sleep quality and fatigue in pregnancy and postpartum. In this trial, 141 women with sleep disturbance at 25-28 weeks gestation were recruited from public health centers in Tabriz, Iran, from May 2013 until January 2014 and randomized into one of three groups receiving: Lavender and footbath, Lavender alone, or placebo cream. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index at the 4th and 8th weeks after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional assessment of fatigue scale at the 6th week after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA were used. Compared with the placebo group, the global sleep quality score post-intervention in pregnancy and the postpartum were significantly lower in the Lavender and footbath and the Lavender cream only groups. Fatigue in both intervention groups was significantly improved only at the 6th week postpartum. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two intervention groups. Lavender cream with or without footbath may improve sleep quality in pregnancy and postpartum.

AU  - Iqbal, Waseem

T2  - American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology
AB  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea, a breathing disorder caused by the repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, results in a state of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Although the etiology and consequences of CIH are extensively investigated in the adult, the developmental ramifications of this disease process are unknown. Design: This study was done to investigate the effect of CIH during gestation on offspring development. Pregnant female Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to daily CIH throughout the gestational period. Results: Postnatal day-1 offspring from CIH mothers were asymmetrically growth restricted, with decreased body weights and elevated brain-weight:liver-weight ratios. Furthermore, CIH newborns had elevated heart- and brain-weight:body weight ratios, and decreased liver-weight:body weight ratios. By adulthood, body weights of growth restricted offspring were significantly greater, as were the liver-weight:body weight ratios. CIH offspring also had greater body fat deposition, were hyperglycemic and had elevated plasma levels of insulin during development into adults. Conclusion: These data suggest that alteration of the maternal intrauterine environment by gestational CIH effects the long-term development of the offspring and increases the risk of the offspring to metabolic diseases in adulthood.

TI  - Effect of sleep and play positions on infant development: reconciling developmental concerns with SIDS prevention.
AU  - Hunter JG
AU  - Malloy MH
T2  - Newborn & Infant Nursing Reviews
AB  - Preterm infants have traditionally been considered at risk for positional deformities and delayed or atypical development. During the last decade, however, similar problems have increasingly been documented in normal infants born at term gestation, with recommendations of supine sleeping for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome often implicated as a causal factor. This article seeks to inform and educate neonatal and pediatric nurses on positional and postural influences in normal and delayed infant development, including the relationship of sleep and play positions to developmental issues. An observant nurse who understands normal development, can recognize atypical postures, and is knowledgeable about potential developmental consequences is in a position to intervene at the earliest interaction with the family. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) sleep position guidelines, however, must not be compromised in the process. Current AAP rationale and guidelines for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome are summarized to facilitate nursing efforts to correctly model and teach infant caregivers. Common-sense suggestions for hospital and community-based nurses to help parents avoid preventable developmental delay while reinforcing current sleep position guidelines are presented.

T2  - Journal of Perinatal Medicine
AB  - Aim: The present observational study aimed to clarify the effects of sleep disorders on threatened premature delivery, especially preterm uterine contraction. Methods: The participants included 122 healthy singleton pregnant women. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index was used to evaluate the quality of sleep during the previous month at the initial examination and at 16, 24, and 32 weeks of gestation; scores > 5 indicate poor sleep. Threatened premature delivery was defined as preterm uterine contraction > 6 times/h and requiring tocolytic therapy before 37 weeks of gestation. We analyzed the relationship between poor sleep and threatened premature delivery. Results: Poor sleep affected 27% (n = 33) at the initial examination, 34% (n = 41) at 16 weeks, 37% (n = 45) at 24 weeks, and 41% (n = 50) at 32 weeks of gestation. There were 23 patients (19%) with threatened premature delivery. Poor sleep affected 35% and 25% of patients with threatened and non-threatened premature delivery at the initial examination, respectively, 52% and 29% at 16 weeks, 48% and 34% at 24 weeks, and 43% and 40% at 32 weeks of gestation. Conclusions: Sleep disorders at 16 weeks of gestation were the most significantly associated with threatened premature delivery.

AB  - Background: Pregnant women with depression and/or anxiety prior to pregnancy are at higher risk of preterm birth, breastfeeding problems, postpartum depression, and disruption of the mother-infant attachment. It is well documented that exercise improves psychological well-being in nonpregnant subjects with symptoms of depression. However, in only a few small studies have researchers examined the effect of exercise on symptoms of depression among pregnant women. We hypothesize that physiotherapist-supervised group exercise for pregnant women at risk of antenatal depression increases their psychological well-being. This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a supervised group exercise intervention for pregnant women with a current or previous history of depression and/or anxiety.Methods/design: The RCT is being carried out at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, in the period 2016-2019. The inclusion criteria are pregnant women ≥18 years of age with depression and/or anxiety requiring treatment by a psychiatrist or a psychologist within the last 10 years and/or intake of antidepressants in the 3 months prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The women must have appropriate Danish language skills, be pregnant with a single fetus, give written informed consent, and be at 17-22 gestational weeks when the intervention begins. The primary outcome is psychological well-being (the five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), functional ability (General Health Questionnaire), clinical symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), sleep quality and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and pregnancy and delivery outcomes. The intervention is supervised group exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. The control group will receive standard antenatal care. On the basis of sample size calculation, a total of 300 women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a ratio of 1:1.Discussion: The trial is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge used in planning antenatal care for pregnant women at risk of depression.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02833519 .

TI  - Effects of altitude on sleep during late pregnancy.
AU  - Kipnis, Gayle Jean
AB  - The majority of pregnancy sleep research has been conducted at sea level and relatively low elevations. Pregnancy at higher altitudes has distinctive physiologic attributes that affect perinatal outcomes and have been correlated with the duration and intensity of altitude. The effect of altitude on adult sleep has been studied at various elevations and has unique characteristics that may impact pregnant women. The effect of altitude on sleep during pregnancy is mostly unknown.This dissertation research explored late pregnancy sleep quantity and quality characteristics at moderate altitude by comparing them to a similar sample at sea level, describing associations between moderate altitude sleep parameters and length of labor by self-report and medical records, and testing associations between sleep and pregnancy outcomes (length of labor and mode of delivery) at moderate altitude. Participants were nulliparous third trimester women (n=50) recruited in Flagstaff, Arizona (elevation 6910 feet [2106 meters]). A 3-day sleep diary and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were completed between 35 gestational weeks and one week prior to delivery. Descriptive statistics, unpaired t-tests, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, ANCOVA, multiple regression, and logistic regression were utilized.Results showed that after controlling for education, compared to nulliparous women at sea level, women at moderate altitude reported significantly higher sleep disturbance scores. After controlling for infant birth weight, length of labor was associated with the PSQI self-report measure for sleep onset latency. Together, infant birth weight, maternal weight, age, income, and sleep onset latency, hours of sleep, sleep disturbance, and sleep quality accounted for 51.6% of the variance in length of labor. Mode of delivery was also associated with sleep disturbance.

TI  - Effects of childhood sexual abuse on childbirth: one woman's story.
AU  - Rose A
T2  - Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care
AB  - Anna Rose is a survivor of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Much of the abuse was 'submerged' until her mid-thirties, when she was pregnant with her second child, and finally began to remember and deal with the realities of what had happened to her. During her second pregnancy, Anna wrote, 'It has taken me more than three years to even begin to deal with the rage I feel about my first birth experience, even though I have been in therapy most of that time. Now that I am pregnant again, the unresolved issues are coming to the surface, and intense fears that this birth will be a repeat of the first.' Anna's first child, Elliot, was born in 1987 in a hospital birthing room in the northeastern United States. Her husband Paul, a younger sister, and a close friend were present, and she was attended by an obstetrician named Bernie. She describes that birth as '19 hours of hard labor, absolutely exhausting and unmanageable, which required drugs at some point to let me sleep for a few hours.' Labor was induced by Pitocin due to premature rupture of membranes and lack of effective contractions after 12 hours. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was used throughout labor. Anna breastfed Elliot for three years, and found La Leche League 'extremely helpful and supportive' during that time. Tom, Anna's second child, was born at home in 1991. Two midwives attended the birth after she changed caregivers during the pregnancy because she 'did not feel safe enough' with the obstetrician and nurse-midwife team she had chosen for this birth. She maintained the team as backup, although they did not know of her plans for a home birth. Her second labor lasted under 6 hours, was noninterventive, and 'incredibly intense and painful, partly due to the abuse memories that were coming up and getting in the way and partly due to the baby's position.' We thank Anna Rose for sharing her story with Birth. Her reason for doing so is, in her words, because, 'I feel strongly that it is important to share this information in an effort to educate health care professionals so that other women may be helped.'

TI  - Effects of Early Parenting Interventions on Parents and Infants: A Meta-Analytic Review.
AU  - Mihelic, Mandy

T2  - Journal of Child & Family Studies
AB  - This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of parenting interventions on parent, infant and parent-infant relationship outcome measures for parents of infants under 12 months old. Parent outcomes examined included competence, and confidence; baby outcomes included infant behaviours of crying, settling, and sleeping problems and parent-infant relationship outcomes included parental responsiveness. Systematic searches of five databases were carried out. In total, 36 randomised controlled trials over the past 35 years were included in the meta-analyses, with a total of 4880 participants. Interventions were carried out either during pregnancy or within the first 12 months after birth and involved teaching specific strategies and provision of information on infant development and behaviour. Mean effect sizes were obtained using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was found on parent responsiveness and infant sleep. Potential moderator variables were assessed for these two outcomes using the SEM approach. Results showed that early parenting interventions are effective in improving parental responsiveness ( d = 0.77), and improving or preventing infant sleep problems ( d = 0.24), but not crying problems ( d = 0.27) possibly due to low power. No conclusions could be drawn in regards to parental competence or confidence. Moderator analysis showed that for interventions aimed at improving responsiveness, briefer interventions were more effective than longer ones; and studies published more recently reported smaller effects than older studies. No other moderators influenced the assessed intervention outcomes. The findings of this study provide further evidence for the positive effects of early parenting interventions for infants under 12 months of age, however future research is needed to assess intervention effects on parental competence and confidence.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) complicates 5-10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, mortality and neurodevelopmental delay. The development of sleep and cardiovascular control are closely coupled and IUGR is known to alter this development. In the long-term, IUGR is associated with altered sleep and an increased risk of hypertension in adulthood. Melatonin plays an important role in the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental animal studies have shown that melatonin therapy has neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in the IUGR fetus. Consequently, clinical trials are currently underway to assess the short and long term effects of antenatal melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies. Given melatonin's role in sleep regulation, this hormone could affect the developing infants' sleep-wake cycle and cardiovascular function after birth. In this review, we will 1) examine the role of melatonin as a therapy for IUGR pregnancies and the potential implications on sleep and the cardiovascular system; 2) examine the development of sleep-wake cycle in fetal and neonatal life; 3) discuss the development of cardiovascular control during sleep; 4) discuss the effect of IUGR on sleep and the cardiovascular system and 5) discuss the future implications of melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies.

AB  - Thirteen healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were studied to examine effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz, square wave) on fetal heart rate, fetal breathing, and gross fetal body movement patterns. All fetuses were stimulated during an episode of low fetal heart rate variability (mean minute range less than or equal to 32 milliseconds for greater than or equal to 5 minutes) lasting at least 5 minutes. There was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term FHR variability, number of FHR accelerations, and gross fetal body movements after stimulation. Fetuses made breathing movements more irregularly after vibratory stimulus. We hypothesize that external low-frequency vibratory stimulus, applied during episodes of low fetal heart rate variability, causes a change from a state of quiet sleep to a state of rapid-eye-movement sleep in healthy term fetuses.

AU  - Kneitel, Anna W.
AU  - Treadwell, Marjorie C.
AU  - O’Brien, Louise M.
T2  - Journal of Perinatology
AB  - Objective: To investigate whether maternal obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with changes in fetal growth trajectory.Study design: Retrospective review of pregnant women who underwent overnight polysomnography. Fetal growth was estimated using sonographic biometric measurements obtained during routine prenatal care. Customized estimated fetal weight and birth weight centiles were calculated and impaired fetal growth was defined as birth weight <10th centile or a slowing of fetal growth by >33% during the last trimester. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between maternal OSA and altered fetal growth after adjusting for potential covariates.Results: There were 48 women without and 31 women with OSA. There were no differences in the proportion of infants with birth weight <10th centile between women with and without OSA (23 vs. 25%, p = 1.0), However, the presence of maternal OSA was predictive of impaired fetal growth (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.6). Logistic regression models were repeated using only a slowing of fetal growth in the 3rd trimester (excluding birth weight <10th centile) and OSA predicted a slowing in fetal growth across the 3rd trimester (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4-9.4). Fourteen additional women were treated with positive airway pressure during pregnancy; fetal growth was not significantly different in these women compared to controls.Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with altered fetal growth, which appears to be ameliorated with use of positive airway pressure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a history of maternal tobacco smoking affected the maturation of arousal responses and whether sleeping position and infant age alters these relations. DESIGN: Healthy term infants (13 born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy) were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) two to three weeks after birth, (b) two to three months after birth, and (c) five to six months after birth. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold in response to air jet stimulation were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. RESULTS: Maternal smoking significantly elevated arousal threshold in QS when infants slept supine at 2-3 months of age (p<0.05). Infants of smoking mothers also had fewer spontaneous arousals from QS at 2-3 months in both prone (p<0.05) and supine (p<0.001) sleeping positions. In infants of non-smoking mothers, arousal thresholds were elevated in the prone position in AS at 2-3 months (p<0.01) and QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and 2-3 months (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal tobacco smoking significantly impairs both stimulus induced and spontaneous arousal from QS when infants sleep in the supine position, at the age when the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome is highest.

T2  - Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology Research
AB  - Abstract: Aim: To elucidate the changes in the daily variation seen in the autonomic nervous system during pregnancy brought about by maternity yoga and to evaluate how maternal yoga affects stress and sleep. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014. Pregnant women who were attending maternity yoga classes at Palmore Hospital between 20 and 23 weeks’ gestation were enrolled as the yoga group, and a matched control group was also enrolled. Study participants completed questionnaires, including a perceived stress scale and sleep logs, during their second and third trimesters. Heart rate variability and salivary α‐amylase levels were evaluated as stress indices at 20–23 weeks’ gestation, 28–31 weeks’ gestation and 36–40 weeks’ gestation. Results: A total of 38 women were in the yoga group, with 53 in the control group. At 28–31 weeks’ gestation, heart rate variability during night and late‐night periods was significantly higher in the yoga group than in the control group. At 36–40 weeks’ gestation, variability between the morning, afternoon and late night was significantly higher in the yoga group. Salivary α‐amylase levels decreased significantly immediately after practicing yoga during all evaluation periods in the yoga group. Night‐time sleep duration was significantly longer in the yoga group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that practicing yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system during the third trimester of pregnancy, consolidating sleep during the night and decreasing α‐amylase levels, which indicates reduced stress.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this experimental pilot study was to measure the effects of a mindfulness-based yoga intervention on sleep in pregnant women. METHODS: Fifteen healthy, nulliparous women in their second or third trimesters with singleton pregnancies attended weekly mindfulness meditation and prenatal Hatha yoga classes in the community for 7 weeks. Sleep variables, as estimated by 72 hr of continuous wrist actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), were recorded at baseline (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2). Control data were obtained by evaluating sleep in the third-trimester group at Time 1. Due to small sample size, data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: Women who began the intervention in the second trimester had significantly fewer awakenings, less wake time during the night, and less perceived sleep disturbance at Time 2 than at baseline. Those who began during the third trimester had poorer sleep over time in spite of the intervention. Women who began the intervention in their second trimester had less awake time at Time 2 compared to third-trimester controls at Time 1. CONCLUSIONS: Mindful yoga shows promise for women in their second trimester of pregnancy to diminish total number of awakenings at night and improve sleep efficiency and merits further exploration. Results from this pilot study provide the data to estimate sample size and design and implement powered and more controlled studies in the future.

AB  - Prenatal sleep disturbance has been associated with undesirable birthing outcomes. To determine the effectiveness of listening to music at home in improving sleep quality, 121 Taiwanese pregnant women with poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] score > 5) were systematically assigned, with a random start to music listening (n = 61) or control (n = 60) group. Participants in the music listening group self-regulated listening to music in addition to receiving general prenatal care similar to that in the control group for 2 weeks. The PSQI and State-Anxiety Inventory were used to assess outcomes. ANCOVA analyses were used with the pretest scores as covariates and showed significant improvement in sleep quality, stress, and anxiety in the music listening group compared with the control group. The most frequently used music genre by participants in the experimental group was lullabies, followed by classical music and crystal baby music. This study supported the theory that 2-week music listening interventions may reduce stress, anxiety, and yield better sleep quality for sleep-disturbed pregnant women. The analysis of participants’ journals also implied that the expectant mothers’ choices of musical genres may correlate more with perceived prenatal benefits or the desire to interact with their unborn child.

AB  - Objective: To examine the effects of a community-based mutual health organization (MHO) on utilization of priority health services, financial protection of its members and inclusion of the poor and other target groups.Methods: Four MHOs were established in two districts in Mali. A case-control study was carried out in which household survey data were collected from 817 MHO member households, 787 non-member households in MHO catchment areas, and 676 control households in areas without MHOs. We compiled MHO register data by household for a 22-month period. Outcome measures included utilization of priority services, health expenditures and out-of-pocket payments. Independent variables included individual, household and community demographic, socioeconomic and access characteristics, as determined through a household survey in 2004.Findings: MHO members who were up to date on premium payments (controlling for education, distance to the nearest health facility and other factors) were 1.7 times more likely to get treated for fevers in modern facilities; three times more likely to take children with diarrhoea to a health facility and/or treat them with oral rehydration salts at home; twice as likely to make four or more prenatal visits; and twice as likely, if pregnant or younger than 5 years, to sleep under an insecticide-treated net (P<0.10 or better in all cases). However, distance was also a significant negative predictor for the utilization of many services, particularly assisted deliveries. Household and individual enrolment in an MHO were not significantly associated with socioeconomic status (with the exception of the highest quintile), and MHOs seemed to provide some financial protection for their members.Conclusion: MHOs are one mechanism that countries strengthening the supply of primary care can use to increase financial access to -- and equity in -- priority health services.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the neurophysiologic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use. The aim of this study, designed to overcome methodologic limitations of previous research, was to investigate the effects of prenatal cocaine use on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, a marker of central nervous system development. METHODS: In a longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine/crack exposure, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester about cocaine, crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. Two-hour paper- and computer-generated EEG sleep recordings were obtained on a sample of the full-term infants on the second day of life and at 1 year postpartum. Eligible newborns were full-term, had received no general anesthesia, and had a 5-minute Apgar score >5. All infants whose mothers used one or more lines of cocaine during their first trimester or any crack (n = 37) were selected. A comparison group was chosen randomly from the group of women who did not use cocaine or crack during their pregnancy (n = 34). RESULTS: Women who used cocaine/crack during the first trimester were older, less educated, less likely to be working, and used more tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs than women who did not use cocaine/crack during the first trimester. There were no differences in infant birth weight, length, head circumference, or gestational age between the two exposure groups. After controlling for the significant covariates, prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with less well developed spectral correlations between homologous brain regions at birth, and with lower spectral EEG power values at 1 year of age. Prenatal alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use were found to affect state regulation and cortical activities. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use can be detected with quantitative EEG measures.

TI  - Effects of prone and supine positions on cardiorespiratory and behavioral parameters in mechanically ventilated preterm infants.
AU  - Chang Y
AB  - Ventilated preterm infants are usually placed supine which might increase energy expenditure due to lowered self-control of infant behaviors in response to environmental stimulation. To determine a better position for ventilated preterm infants, this study was done: (1) to compare the effect of supine and prone position on factors which impact energy conservation, including motor activity, behavioral state, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and heart rate (HR); and (2) to examine relationships among these variables.Twenty-eight premature infants undergoing intermittent mandatory ventilation were included. Inclusion criteria were: <36 weeks gestation, <seven days postnatal age, no sedation or congenital abnormalities, and parental consent.A two-period crossover was used. Each infant was randomly assigned to position sequence: supine/prone or prone/supine. Infants were placed supine for two hours and prone for two hours. During the study protocol, care procedures were minimized and ventilator weaning did not occur.Most hypotheses were supported. When infants were prone, compared to supine, they had (a) less motor activity (1.11 vs. 2.16, p < .001), (b) less crying (6% vs. 12%, p < .05), less active sleep (24% vs. 43%, p < .001), and more quiet sleep (68% vs. 40%, p < .001), (c) less signs of behavioral stress (8.9 vs. 27.3, p < .001), (d) higher SpO2 (96.5% vs. 95.7%, p < .01) and (e) fewer oxygen desaturation event, defined as SpO2 <90% and >=20 seconds (.86 vs. 4.47, p < .01). No significant differences were found in HR and frequencies of tachycardia and bradycardia. Motor activity was positively related to HR (r = .3) but negatively related to SpO2 (r = -.2); active sleep, active awake, and crying were associated with higher HR and lower SpO2. However, without severe oxygen desaturation, SpO 2 was not associated with HR.These findings suggest that prone position may reduce oxygen desaturation and assist energy conservation for ventilated preterm infants. Improved energy conservation, in turn, may enhance infant adaptation to extrauterine life and facilitate ventilator weaning.

T2  - Journal of Advanced Nursing
AB  - BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Preterm infants in mechanical ventilation are vulnerable and may manifest physiological instability and a disorganized behavioural state when responding to external stimuli. Adequate positioning strategies may play an important role in protecting infants from environmental stressor and assisting quality of sleep. However, no study has examined effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch responses for ventilated preterm infants during the critical first week postbirth. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to compare effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress responses in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. DESIGN/METHODS: The infants were aged 25-36 weeks of gestation, < or = 7 days of age, and without sedation or congenital abnormalities. Using a crossover design, 28 infants were randomly assigned to supine/prone or prone/supine position sequence. Infants were placed in each position for 2 hours. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. Behavioural state and frequencies of stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch were systemically recorded and analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance. FINDINGS: Infants when prone compared with supine had (a) less crying, less active sleep, and more quiet sleep states, and (b) fewer stress responses of startle, tremor, and twitch. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that prone positioning improves the quality of sleep and decreases stress for ventilated preterm infants during the first week postbirth. These may conserve energy and assist infants' extrauterine adaptation.

T2  - Health Care for Women International
AB  - Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities, reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function. Sixty-eight nurses < 40 years old completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual function, and pregnancy outcome. Fifty-three percent of the women noted menstrual changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more physiological symptoms (p < 0.003), slept approximately one hour less when working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep (p < 0.01) when working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork intolerance.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether sleep disturbances during pregnancy affect cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of 160 pregnant women at various stages of gestation. Participants were interviewed about their sleep length per night, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), snoring habits, and symptoms of restless legs syndrome during the previous few weeks. Cardiac autonomic modulation in the resting state was quantified by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) from short-term electrocardiogram monitoring. The relationship of HRV to diverse covariates was studied by multiple regression analysis.Results: No significant influences were observed of short sleep duration (<7 hours per night), poor sleep quality (PSQI score >5), or restless legs syndrome on HRV measures. Participants with excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS score >9) and habitual snorers had a significantly elevated low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio and LF power in normalized units (LF norm). In multiple regression analyses, habitual snoring was strongly and positively associated with LF/HF ratio (P<0.001) and LF norm (P<0.001).Conclusion: Resting cardiac autonomic modulation was found to shift toward a sympathetic predominant state among pregnant women who are habitual snorers.

AB  - Background: During pregnancy, a sedentary lifestyle may have negative consequences on maternal and foetal health status. The main objective of this project is to assess the effects of an exercise intervention in overweight and grade I obese pregnant on maternal and foetal health markers.Methods/design: The present study aims to recruit 60 overweight and grade I obese women interested in participating in an exercise intervention program from the 17th gestational week until delivery. Women will be randomized to either an exercise (three 60-min sessions/week of combined aerobic and strength training and pelvic floor exercises), or usual care (control) group (30 women per group). The primary outcome measures are maternal weight gain, and maternal and neonatal glycaemic profile. Secondary outcome measures are: i) perinatal obstetric records; i) body composition; iii) dietary patterns; iv) physical fitness; v) low-back pain; vi) objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour; vii) haematology and biochemical analyses; viii) oxidative stress; ix) pro- and anti-inflammatory markers; x) bone health biomarkers; xi) sleep quality; xii) mental health, quality of life and positive health.Discussion: The findings of this project will help to identify strategies for primary prevention and health promotion based on this exercise-based intervention program among overweight and grade I obese pregnant women.Trial Registration: NCT02582567 ; Date of registration: 20/10/2015.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of a 15-month intervention on dietary intake conducted among obesity-prone normal-weight pre-school children.Design: Information on dietary intake was obtained using a 4 d diet record. A diet quality index was adapted to assess how well children's diet complied with the Danish national guidelines. Linear regression per protocol and intention-to-treat analyses of differences in intakes of energy, macronutrients, fruit, vegetables, fish, sugar-sweetened beverages and diet quality index between the two groups were conducted.Setting: The Healthy Start study was conducted during 2009-2011, focusing on changing diet, physical activity, sleep and stress management to prevent excessive weight gain among Danish children.Subjects: From a population of 635 Danish pre-school children, who had a high birth weight (≥4000 g), high maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (≥28·0 kg/m2) or low maternal educational level (<10 years of schooling), 285 children completed the intervention and had complete information on dietary intake.Results: Children in the intervention group had a lower energy intake after the 15-month intervention (group means: 5·29 v. 5·59 MJ, P=0·02) compared with the control group. We observed lower intakes of carbohydrates and added sugar in the intervention group compared with the control group after the intervention (P=0·002, P=0·01).Conclusions: The intervention resulted in a lower energy intake, particularly from carbohydrates and added sugar after 15 months of intervention, suggesting that dietary intake can be changed in a healthier direction in children predisposed to obesity.

AB  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and highly burdensome sleep disorder. While relaxation therapies, including yoga, are often recommended for RLS management, rigorous supporting research is sparse. The goal of this preliminary study was to assess the effects of yoga on RLS symptoms and related outcomes in women with RLS. Methods: Participants were 13 nonsmoking women with moderate to severe RLS, who did not have diabetes, sleep apnea, or other serious concomitant chronic conditions, and who were not pregnant. The intervention was a gentle, 8-week Iyengar yoga program. Core outcomes assessed pre- and post-treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Scale [IRLS] and RLS ordinal scale), sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Participants also completed yoga logs and a brief exit questionnaire regarding their experience with the study. Results: Ten (10) women, aged 32-66 years, completed the study. Participants attended an average 13.4±0.5 (of 16 possible) classes, and completed a mean of 4.1±0.3 (of 5 possible) homework sessions/week. At follow-up, participants demonstrated striking reductions in RLS symptoms and symptom severity, with symptoms decreasing to minimal/mild in all but 1 woman and no participant scoring in the severe range by week 8. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large: 1.6 for IRLS total, and 2.2 for RLS ordinal scale. IRLS scores declined significantly with increasing minutes of homework practice per session ( r=0.70, p=0.025) and total homework minutes ( r=0.64, p<0.05), suggesting a possible dose-response relation. Participants also showed significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood (all p's≤0.02), with effect sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that yoga may be effective in attenuating RLS symptoms and symptom severity, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep and mood in women with RLS.

AB  - Maternal morbidity is associated with cesarean deliveries. However, new evidence suggests that short- and long-term neonatal morbidity is also associated. This includes respiratory morbidity with conflicting results. To determine whether mode of delivery has an impact on the long-term risk for respiratory morbidity in the offspring, a population-based cohort analysis was conducted including all singleton term deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single tertiary medical center. A comparison was performed between children delivered via elective cesarean delivery (CD) and those delivered vaginally. Multiple gestations and fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded from the analysis as were all cases of urgent CDs. Pediatric hospitalizations involving respiratory morbidity of offspring up to the age of 18 years were evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity incidence and a Cox regression model to control for confounders. During the study period, 132,054 term deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 8.9% were via elective CDs (n = 11,746) and 91.1% (n = 120,308) were vaginal deliveries. Hospitalizations of the offspring involving respiratory morbidity were significantly more common in offspring delivered by CDs (5.2 vs. 4.3% in vaginal deliveries, p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of respiratory morbidity in the elective CD group (log rank p < 0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model, while controlling for maternal age, gestational age, and birthweight, CD exhibited a significant and independent association with long-term respiratory morbidity of the offspring (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.22 (CI, 1.12-1.33), p < 0.001).Conclusion: Elective cesarean delivery at term is a significant risk factor for long-term pediatric respiratory morbidity of the offspring. What is Known: • Cesarean delivery is a major surgery with known possible complications. • Cesarean delivery has possible immediate complications for the newborn including respiratory complications. What is New: • Our study shows more long term respiratory morbidity in the CD group including asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. • Different possible explanations have been proposed including exposure to maternal flora during vaginal delivery and the stress hormones secreted during contractions and delivery.

AB  - We report a patient with pregnancy related obstructive sleep apnea ([OSA]; apnea hypopnea index [AHI] 18/h) early after delivery, with improvement of AHI by 87% following 45-degree elevation in body position compared with the non-elevated position. Improvement associated with this position may be explained, at least in part, by an increased upper airway diameter (as measured during wakefulness). Sleep apnea in this patient resolved at 9 months postpartum. This observation suggests that 45-degree elevated body position may be an effective treatment of pregnancy related OSA during the postpartum period.

AB  - Study Objectives: Pregnant women have an increased risk of experiencing restless legs syndrome (RLS). Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology. Design: Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin, hemoglobin) and polysomnographic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol. Interventions: N/A. Results: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211 ± 6,397 pg/mL vs. 25,475 ± 7,990 pg/mL, P< 0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P < 0.05). PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P < 0.05); sleep efficiency increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron, ferritin or hemoglobin. Conclusions: RLS in pregnant women goes along with transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: During pregnancy, upper airway resistance is increased, predisposing vulnerable women to pregnancy-related OSA. Elevation of the upper body increases upper airway cross-sectional area (CSA) and improves severity of OSA in a subgroup of nonpregnant patients (positional-dependent sleep apnea). We tested the hypothesis that elevated position of the upper body improves OSA early after delivery.Methods: Following institutional review board approval, we conducted a randomized, crossover study on two postpartum units of Massachusetts General Hospital. Women during the first 48 h after delivery were included. Polysomnography was performed in nonelevated and 45° elevated upper body position. Upper airway CSA was measured by acoustic pharyngometry in nonelevated, 45° elevated, and sitting body position.Results: Fifty-five patients were enrolled, and measurements of airway CSA obtained. Thirty patients completed polysomnography in both body positions. Elevation of the upper body significantly reduced apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from 7.7 ± 2.2/h in nonelevated to 4.5 ± 1.4/h in 45° elevated upper body position (P = .031) during sleep. Moderate to severe OSA (AHI > 15/h) was diagnosed in 20% of postpartum patients and successfully treated by elevated body position in one-half of them. Total sleep time and sleep architecture were not affected by upper body elevation. Change from nonelevated to sitting position increased inspiratory upper airway CSA from 1.35 ± 0.1 cm2 to 1.54 ± 0.1 cm2 during wakefulness. Position-dependent increase in CSA and decrease in AHI were correlated (r = 0.42, P = .022).Conclusions: Among early postpartum women, 45° upper body elevation increased upper airway CSA and mitigated sleep apnea. Elevated body position might improve respiratory safety in women early after delivery.Trial Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT01719224; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.

T2  - BMJ Case Reports
AB  - Melnick-Needles syndrome (M-NS) is a rare genetic disorder which primarily affects skeletal developments. M-NS may also affect the cardiorespiratory and renal systems. A 35 kg patient presented complaining of abdominal pain. Following a positive pregnancy test and ultrasound examination, she was diagnosed with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She had a significant background history of M-NS, obstructive sleep apnoea (with narrow gauge tracheostomy in situ), obstructive lung disease and scoliosis. She received fluid resuscitation, and the case was managed using an open salpingectomy and clot evacuation under combined spinal/epidural anaesthesia. Anticipated difficulty in securing a definitive airway was pivotal to choosing a regional anaesthetic technique. The operation was successful and the patient recovered well. This was a unique surgical and anaesthetic challenge due to abnormal facial, spinal and abdominal morphology compounded by the time-critical emergency nature of the case. Individually tailored perioperative management is frequently required for patients with rare syndromes.

T2  - Journal of Reproductive & Infant Psychology
AB  - Objective: This systematic review explores changes in perinatal empathy and influence on maternal behaviours and child development. Background: The well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers' capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may disrupt empathic processing. Methods: Original research papers (n = 7413) published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking. Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. Results: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of children and was partially explained by mothers' aversive response to infant crying. Conclusion: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based, incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.

TI  - Energy conservation during skin-to-skin contact between premature infants and their mothers.
AU  - Ludington SM
T2  - Heart & Lung
AB  - The effects of skin-to-skin contact on three indexes of energy expenditure: heart rate, activity level, and behavioral state, were examined in a pilot study. It was hypothesized that skin-to-skin contact, because of its soothing effects, would increase sleep, lower activity level, and reduce heart rate. Eight healthy preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, who had reached 34 to 36 weeks gestation, experienced one session of skin-to-skin contact for an interfeeding interval. Observations were made once each minute using continuous videotape throughout three consecutive interfeeding intervals (before, during, and after skin-to-skin contact). Significant treatment effects were found by repeated-measures analysis of variance for behavioral state and activity level; pair-wise comparisons showed that quiet sleep frequency was significantly increased and activity level reduced during skin-to-skin contact. Infants had longer durations of quiet sleep during skin-to-skin contact. The Pearson product-moment correlation between heart rate and behavioral state was robust and generally linear, supporting use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure in these subjects. The findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact is a simple, cost-effective intervention that reduces activity and state-related energy expenditure.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify factors that may predispose women to excess gestational weight gain (GWG).Methods: Seventy-two healthy women with obesity (30 class I, 24 class II, 18 class III) expecting a singleton pregnancy were studied at 13 to 16 weeks gestation. Energy expenditure (EE) was measured during sleep (SleepEE, average EE from 0200-0500 hours) in a whole-room calorimeter, and total daily EE (TDEE) over 7 days using doubly labeled water. Glucose, insulin, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines were measured.Results: Body composition explained 70% variability in SleepEE, and SleepEE accounted for 67% to 73% of TDEE. Though there was no evidence of consistent low metabolism, there was considerable variability. Low SleepEE was associated with insulin resistance and low triiodothyronine concentrations (both P = 0.01). Physical activity level was 1.47 ± 0.02. For women with SleepEE within 100 kcal/d of their predicted EE, TDEE was significantly less than the estimate (2,530 ± 91 vs. 2,939 kcal/d; P < 0.001) provided from the most recent gestational energy requirement model.Conclusions: Pregnant women with obesity are inactive, possibly predisposing them to excess GWG. Current energy requirement models overestimate activity and may promote excess GWG in women with obesity. Furthermore, the observed large interindividual variability in basal metabolism may be important to consider when assessing the risk for excess GWG.

AB  - Background: Sleep fragmentation during late gestation (LG-SF) is one of the major perturbations associated with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders during pregnancy. We have previously shown that LG-SF induces metabolic dysfunction in offspring mice during adulthood.Objectives: To investigate the effects of late LG-SF on metabolic homeostasis in offspring and to determine the effects of LG-SF on the epigenome of visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) in the offspring.Methods: Time-pregnant mice were exposed to LG-SF or sleep control during LG (LG-SC) conditions during the last 6 days of gestation. At 24 weeks of age, lipid profiles and metabolic parameters were assessed in the offspring. We performed large-scale DNA methylation analyses using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled with microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in VWAT of 24-week-old LG-SF and LG-SC offspring (n=8 mice per group). Univariate multiple-testing adjusted statistical analyses were applied to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the groups. DMRs were mapped to their corresponding genes, and tested for potential overlaps with biological pathways and gene networks.Results: We detected significant increases in body weight (31.7 vs 28.8 g; P=0.001), visceral (642.1 vs 497.0 mg; P=0.002) and subcutaneous (293.1 vs 250.1 mg; P=0.001) fat mass, plasma cholesterol (110.6 vs 87.6 mg dl(-1); P=0.001), triglycerides (87.3 vs 84.1 mg dl(-1); P=0.003) and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance values (8.1 vs 6.1; P=0.007) in the LG-SF group. MeDIP analyses revealed that 2148 DMRs (LG-SF vs LG-SC; P<0.0001, model-based analysis of tilling-arrays algorithm). A large proportion of the DMR-associated genes have reported functions that are altered in obesity and metabolic syndrome, such as Cartpt, Akt2, Apoe, Insr1 and so on. Overrepresented pathways and gene networks were related to metabolic regulation and inflammatory response.Conclusions: Our findings show a major role for epigenomic regulation of pathways associated with the metabolic processes and inflammatory responses in VWAT. LG-SF-induced epigenetic alterations may underlie increases in the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring.

AB  - Abstract: Over 25,000 epileptic women deliver viable pregnancies each year in the United States. Although medical management is the first line of treatment, many physiological changes associated with pregnancy can make optimal treatment challenging. Medication dosage is adjusted based on side effects and seizure frequency, with the goal being no seizures with the lowest medication dosage(s) and side-effect profile possible. Whenever possible, monotherapy is preferred. Many antiepileptic drugs have teratogenic potential, so preconceptional optimization of medication dosage(s) is recommended. Epilepsy has associated neurological comorbidities, the most common being migraines and sleep disorders.

T2  - Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology
AB  - Purpose: To study the epileptiform discharges (EDs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 6-8-year-old children of women with epilepsy (WWE). Materials and Methods: All children born to women with epilepsy and prospectively followed up through the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy (KREP), aged 6–8 years, were invited (n = 532). Out of the 254 children who responded, clinical evaluations and a 30-min digital 18 channel EEG were completed in 185 children. Results: Of the 185 children examined, 37 (20%) children (19 males, 18 females) had ED in their EEG. The EDs were generalized in 7 children, and focal in 30 children. The EDs were present in the sleep record only of 16 (43%) children and in the awake record only of 6 (16%) children. Out of the 94 children for whom seizure history was available, 7 children (7.4%) had seizures (neonatal seizures: 4, febrile seizure: 1, and single nonfebrile seizure: 2) and none had history of epilepsy or recurrent nonfebrile seizures. The odds ratio (OR) for occurrence of ED in the EEG was significantly higher for children of WWE [OR = 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-6.0] when compared to the published data for age-matched children of mothers without epilepsy. There was no association between the occurrence of ED and the children’s maternal characteristics [epilepsy syndrome, seizures during pregnancy, maternal intelligence quotient (IQ)] or the children’s characteristics [antenatal exposure to specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), birth weight, malformations, IQ]. Conclusion: Children of WWE have a higher risk of epileptiform activity in their EEG when compared to healthy children in the community though none had recurrent seizures.

T2  - American Family Physician
AB  - Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem that occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of women. Lactation requires the presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress, suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wall irritation and physiologic causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.

AB  - To increase access to safe infant sleep surfaces and reduce risk of sleep-related infant deaths, the Georgia Department of Public Health implemented a portable crib distribution and safe sleep educational program. The aim of this evaluation was to compare parental knowledge and practices related to infant sleep before and after receipt of the safe sleep educational program and crib. A prospective, matched pre- and post-test cohort design with a follow-up survey was utilized to evaluate changes in knowledge and practices. Female participants were recruited through the county health department and met the following criteria: (1) between 32 and 40 weeks pregnant or within 3 months postpartum, and (2) demonstrated financial need. Participants completed a survey prior to the start of a group educational program and upon program completion. For those who agreed, a follow-up phone survey was conducted approximately 10 weeks after program completion or after the infant’s birth. McNemar’s Chi square tests were conducted to detect significant differences between specific items on pre-test, post-test, and follow-up surveys, and paired sample t tests were conducted to compare differences in knowledge and practice scores. A total of 132 participants completed matched pre- and post-test surveys and 76 completed follow-up surveys. Knowledge of recommendations regarding position, surface, environment, smoking, breastfeeding, and pacifier use increased significantly between pre- and post-test, with most participants maintaining knowledge at follow-up. The proportion of recommended practices also increased significantly. A group-based safe sleep educational program can be effective in reducing risky infant sleep practices.

T2  - Journal of Paediatrics & Child Health
AB  - Aim: Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) rates for Māori and Pacific infants remain higher than for other ethnic groups in New Zealand and bed-sharing is a major risk factor when there is smoking exposure in pregnancy. Sleep space programmes of education and Pēpi-Pod baby beds require evaluation.Methods: Two hundred and forty Māori and Pacific women and infants were randomised 1:1, to the Pēpi-Pod sleep space programme, or to a control group with 'usual care'. When infants were under 2 weeks of age, baseline interviews occurred, followed up by interviews at 2 and 4 months of age to assess safe sleep knowledge, infant care practices and Pēpi-Pod use and acceptability. All participants were offered a New Zealand Standard approved portable cot.Results: At baseline, 25% of babies did not have a baby bed. Knowledge of smoking and bed-sharing as SUDI risks improved at follow-up in both groups. One quarter regularly bed-shared at follow-up in both groups. Intention to bed-share was a strong predictor of subsequent behaviour. Pēpi-Pods were regularly used by 46% at 2 months and 16% at 4 months follow-up.Conclusions: Bed-sharing and knowledge improvement were similar irrespective of group. It is likely that the impact of the intervention was reduced because the control group received better support than 'usual care' and all participants had a baby bed. New Zealand SUDI rates have declined since sleep space programmes have been available. Sleep space programmes should be prioritised for those with modifiable SUDI risk.

AB  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a disease which is estimated to be undiagnosed to a large extent. Hence, the prevalence of OSAS in pregnant women is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women with chronic diseases.Methods: In the study, 97 pregnant women with chronic diseases and 160 healthy pregnant women were included. A form questioning socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy characteristics, Epworth scale and the Berlin questionnaire to evaluate the risk of OSAS were applied to participants.Results: It has been determined that 10-12.5% of healthy pregnant women, 34-45.4% of pregnants with chronic diseases and 20.6-23.3% of all pregnant women had a high risk of OSAS, the pregnants with chronic disease compared to healthy pregnant women had statistically significant higher risk of OSAS. The risk of OSAS was found to be significantly higher especially in pregnant women with hypertension and diabetes.Conclusions: OSAS can lead to the adverse consequences in pregnancy, should be questioned for all pregnants especially those with chronic diseases. Pregnant women with OSAS should be monitored more carefully in terms of diabetes and hypertension in antenatal care.

T2  - International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics
AB  - Background: Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological option to relieve pregnancy-related complaints.Objectives: To critically appraise the best available evidence for the use of acupuncture in outpatient care.Search Strategy: The MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases were searched for English-language and German-language papers published from January 1980 to March 2017 using search terms related to pregnancy combined with 'acupuncture'.Selection Criteria: Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-pharmacological treatments in unselected or low-risk pregnant women.Data Collection and Analysis: Quality was assessed using a checklist (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were also performed.Main Results: High-quality systematic reviews (n=5) and RCTs with low risk of bias (n=3) were identified. The systematic reviews were based on single studies, with small sample sizes, that showed a benefit of acupuncture for evening pelvic pain; pelvic and low-back pain; nausea; functional disability; and sleep quality. Contradictory results were found in the RCTs regarding cesarean delivery; time to delivery; spontaneous labor; fetal distress; and Apgar score. Data pooling emphasized the heterogeneity of results.Conclusions: Evidence to support the use of acupuncture for relief of pregnancy-related conditions was limited.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate relationships among women's body attitudes, physical symptoms, self-esteem, depression, and sleep quality during pregnancy. Pregnant women (N=215) at 15-25 weeks gestation completed a questionnaire including four body image subscales assessing self-reported feeling fat, attractiveness, strength/fitness, and salience of weight and shape. Women reported on 29 pregnancy-related physical complaints, and completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regressions, controlling for retrospective reports of body image, more frequent and intense physical symptoms were related to viewing the self as less strong/fit, and to poorer sleep quality and more depressive symptoms. In a multi-factorial model extending previous research, paths were found from sleep quality to depressive symptoms to self-esteem; self-esteem was found to be a mediator associated with lower scores on feeling fat and salience of weight and shape, and on higher perceived attractiveness.

T2  - Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care
AB  - Background: Although both expectant mothers and expectant fathers complain of fatigue during the last trimester of pregnancy, studies have focused exclusively on mothers. This pilot study examined parents' levels of morning or evening fatigue, number of uninterrupted sleep periods and length of sleep during the last trimester of pregnancy; and the relationship of sleep to parents' reports of fatigue. Methods: Data were collected from 24 midwestern, nulliparous couples, who completed the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue each morning and each evening on 4 consecutive days during the last trimester. Concurrently, the couples recorded sleep and wake periods in an activity diary. Results: Expectant mothers but not expectant fathers reported increasing levels of fatigue, especially morning fatigue, as the pregnancy progressed. Expectant fathers and mothers did not differ either in the night-time mean number of minutes of sleep obtained, or in the mean number of night-time uninterrupted 90-minute sleep cycles obtained. Fatigue and sleep were not significantly related for either mothers or fathers. Conclusions: These findings support the multidimensional nature of fatigue and indicate a need for perinatal health caregivers to develop individualized interventions for mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy. Fathers should also participate in future research of factors influencing the prenatal and postpartum experience.

AB  - Pregnancy usually is an exciting and joyous time, however it is accompanied by some common and unpleasant conditions referred to as minor disorders of pregnancy. The disorders are not life threatening, just a normal part of pregnancy but they can be troublesome. The study assessed the experience and coping measures of minor discomforts of pregnancy (nausea, vomiting and back-pain) among pregnant women. A cross sectional analytical design was employed for the study and simple random sampling technique was used to select 300 pregnant women proportionally from Primary Health Care Centre, Idi-Ogungun and Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Yemetu. Structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Descriptive statistics and chi square were used for analysis. More than two-third of the women experienced nausea and vomiting (79.9%) and back-pain (77.7%) in pregnancy. The respondents coped well with the selected discomforts of pregnancy as majority scored above the average rating score of 5. The commonly used coping measures for nausea and vomiting among the respondents are licking sweets 193(92.3%) and ginger 72(34.5%) and the mostly used coping measures for backpain in pregnancy are asking for assistance with task (95.1%), sleep/rest 123(85.4%) and massage 97(67.4%). There is significant association between severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and degree of coping, p value< 0.05. Nausea, vomiting and back-pain are common complaints in pregnancy. Finding unveiled that the women coped well with the selected discomforts. Midwives continuous assessment and education on every visit to antenatal clinic is recommended to enhance coping and prompt management in extreme cases.

AB  - Aims To explore the experiences of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, and the relationships between perceptions of glucose control, attitudes to technology and glycaemic responses with regard to closed-loop insulin delivery. Methods We recruited 16 pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes [mean ± sd age 34.1 ± 4.6 years, duration of diabetes 23.6 ± 7.2 years, baseline HbA1c 51±5 mmol/mol (6.8 ± 0.6%)] to a randomized crossover trial of sensor-augmented pump therapy vs automated closed-loop therapy. Questionnaires (Diabetes Technology Questionnaire, Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey) were completed before and after each intervention, with qualitative interviews at baseline and follow-up. Results Women described the benefits and burdens of closed-loop systems during pregnancy. Feelings of improved glucose control, excitement and empowerment were counterbalanced by concerns about device visibility, obsessive data checking and diminished attentiveness to hyper- and hypoglycaemia symptoms. Responding to questionnaires, eight participants felt less worry about overnight hypoglycaemia and that diabetes 'did not run their lives'; however, five reported that closed-loop increased time thinking about diabetes, and three felt it made sleep and preventing hyperglycaemia more problematic. Women slightly overestimated their glycaemic response to closed-loop therapy. Most became more positive in their technology attitudes throughout pregnancy. Women with more positive technology attitudes had higher degrees of overestimation, and poorer levels of glycaemic control. Conclusions Women displayed complex psychosocial responses to closed-loop therapy in pregnancy. Perceptions of glycaemic response may diverge from biomedical data.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the perinatal period using appraisal theory of emotions. Design Repeated measures. Setting Antenatal clinics of a health center associated with the Northern Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants 122 pregnant women in their third trimester of gestation. Methods Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and an appraisal questionnaire during the third trimester of gestation, within 7 to 10 days after childbirth, and at 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Correlational and regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and appraisals. Results Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhood-related issues as well as with negative expectations about the future. Conclusions Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are similar to those related to maternal distress identified by previous research. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between self-reports of sleep and maternal mood. Practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To identify the effectiveness of 'facilitated tucking,' a nonpharmacologic nursing intervention, as a comfort measure in modulating preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses to minor pain. Design: Prospective, repeated measure, random sequencing, and experimental. Setting: Level III neonatal intensive-care unit of a tertiary care university pediatric hospital. Participants: Thirty preterm neonates, 25-35 weeks gestation. Interventions: Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and sleep state were recorded 12 minutes before, during, and 15 minutes after two heelsticks, one with and one without facilitated tucking. Hypothesis: Premature neonates will have less variation in heart rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation, shorter crying and sleep disruption times, and less fluctuation in sleep states in response to the painful stimulus of a heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. Results: Neonates demonstrated a lower mean heart rate 6-10 minutes post-stick (p < 0.04), shorter mean crying time (p < 0.001), shorter mean sleep disruption time (p < 0.001), and fewer sleep-state changes (p = 0.003) after heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. Conclusion: Facilitated tucking is an effective comfort measure in attenuating premature neonates' psychologic and behavioral responses to minor pain.

AB  - Objective:This study examined prospectively whether maternal orientation (Facilitator/Regulator) in pregnancy predicted maternal orientation and mothering practices at six months postpartum.Background:A woman’s preferred approach to infant care, present prior to the birth, has been proposed to explain individual differences in mothering behaviour.Method:At 30 weeks gestation, 192 women completed two questionnaire measures assessing maternal orientation. At six months postpartum, maternal orientation and maternal caretaking behaviours were assessed by interview and questionnaire.Results:Bivariate analyses indicated small but significant correlations among measures of antenatal and postnatal maternal orientation. In addition, as predicted, lower Regulator scores in pregnancy were associated with greater likelihood of breastfeeding exclusively, less scheduling of infant feeds and sleeps, and less likelihood of leaving baby to cry to sleep. Associations were found between mother–infant night-time proximity and postnatal (but not antenatal) maternal orientation.Conclusions:Findings offer modest support for the stability and construct validity of maternal orientation assessed in pregnancy and reveal antenatal attitudinal factors that influence maternal caregiving trajectories.

AB  - Mother-infant bed-sharing has been associated with a higher risk of sleep-related infant deaths, which affects African Americans at a disproportionately higher rate. Although 'separate but proximate sleep surfaces' for infants has been recommended since 2005, bed-sharing remains a common practice, especially among African Americans. This study examined factors associated with bed-sharing among African American and White mothers. Separate logistic regression models were constructed for African American and White respondents to the 2007-2010 Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System. The sample consisted of 806 African Americans and 1,680 Whites ( N = 2,486). A significantly larger proportion of African Americans (70.6 %) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.4 %). For both races, partner-related stress was significantly associated with bed-sharing; no significant differences were found between the two racial groups. For African Americans, partner stress (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) and maternal education of 13-15 years (OR 2.0: 1.2-3.4) or ≥16 years (OR 2.7: 1.1-6.3) was associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. For Whites, partner stress (OR 1.3: 1-1.8), breastfeeding (OR 2.5: 1.9-3.1), income of $35,000-$49,999 (OR 1.6: 1.2-2.3), being unmarried (OR 1.5: 1.1-2.2), needing money for food (OR 1.6: 1.1-2.3), and non-supine sleep (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) were associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. Differences were found in bed-sharing factors between racial groups which suggests a need for culturally-relevant, tailored safe infant sleep interventions. Providers should ask families about their infant's sleeping environment and address safety issues within that environment. More research is needed on the context and reasons for bed-sharing.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep, common during pregnancy, is associated with negative health risks. The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant insomnia among pregnant Latinas. Methods: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and questions about demographics and sleep. Results: Clinically significant insomnia (ISI≥10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS≥9 and 9% with EPDS<9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26% versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%) was experienced by women with EPDS≥9 who completed measures in English. The lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by women with EPDS<9 who completed measures in Spanish. Conclusions: In this sample of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas. Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation, as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors (e.g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be important to directly test this explanation in future research.

AB  - Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman's ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4-15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score ≥9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years ± 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean pre-pregnancy BMI 30 kg/m ± 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored ≥9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).

AB  - Objective: To quantify insomnia and their components in a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women and factors associated with insomnia.Study Design: A prospective cohort of 486 healthy singleton pregnancies assembled before the 14th gestational week (February 2013 to March 2016). Insomnia data were collected pre-gestationally, in each trimester and six months post-partum, analysing five different moments. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to generate adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of determinants of insomnia in each trimester, defined using Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) as score ≥8.Results: Insomnia prevalence was 6.1% (3.9-8.9) pre-gestational, 44.2% (39.3-49.6) in first trimester (T1), 46.3% (41.9-51.3) in second (T2) and 63.7% (57.7-67.8) in third trimester (T3). Post-gestational insomnia was 33.2% (28.2-37.9) (p < 0.001 pre-gestational vs T1, T2 vs T3 and T3 vs after pregnancy). There was worsening mean AIS score, from: 2.34 before pregnancy to 9.87 in T3 because the deterioration of nighttime sleep, in absolute terms, but daytime impact was higher in T1. Previous trimester insomnia was associated with insomnia in T2 (aOR = 4.21, 95% CI 2.78-6.37) and T3 (aOR = 4.43, 95% CI 2.77-7.08). Pre-gestational insomnia was determinant of insomnia in T1 (aOR 12.50, 95% CI 3.58-43.60) and obesity was associated with insomnia in T3 (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI 0.99-5.32). On the contrary, moderate physical activity reduced the odds of insomnia in T3 (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40-1.03).Conclusions: Insomnia prevalence was high from the beginning of pregnancy, associated with pre-gestational insomnia. In late pregnancy, two out of three pregnant women suffering insomnia. Insomnia prevention should be targeted particularly to those with high body mass index and pre-gestational insomnia.

The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background. Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design. This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods. Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21-40 years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results. Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion. When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and emotional changes. Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, these changes can affect the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women, affecting both maternal and infant health. The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic, physical and psychological factors in developed countries.Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made in PubMed, EMBASE and BDSP (Public Health Database). Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Countries with a human development index over 0.7 were selected. The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of the STROBE criteria.Results: In total, thirty-seven articles were included. While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout pregnancy, the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy. Main factors associated with better QOL were mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age, the absence of social and economic problems, having family and friends, doing physical exercise, feeling happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic. Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction, complications before or during pregnancy, obesity, nausea and vomiting, epigastralgia, back pain, smoking during the months prior to conception, a history of alcohol dependence, sleep difficulties, stress, anxiety, depression during pregnancy and sexual or domestic violence.Conclusions: Health-related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical, mental and social dimensions of well-being. Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible.

AB  - Aim: To determine the relationship between the working situation (full-time housewife, stopped working during pregnancy, or currently employed) and the lifestyle factors, reasons for stopping work during pregnancy, and effects of working conditions in order to identify the factors that are related to the continuation of employment among pregnant Japanese women. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to pregnant women who visited an obstetrics clinic in a Tokyo suburb for an outpatient medical check-up during July and August 2004. Results: The data of 530 healthy pregnant women were analyzed. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy had lower mental health scores than the full-time housewives and employed pregnant women. In each trimester, the employed pregnant women reported a shorter daytime sleep duration than the pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy and the full-time housewives. The reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were categorized as somatic symptoms due to pregnancy, working conditions, and a sense of values or social reasons. The employed women in the third trimester more often reported the availability of, and access to, a rest area in their company, compared to those in the first and second trimesters. Conclusion: The lifestyle factors of the pregnant women were different, based on their work situation. In particular, the employed pregnant women had a shorter daytime sleep duration. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy could have benefited from mental health support. In addition, the reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were different in the three trimesters. A flexible

AB  - AIM: To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the sleeping environment of Irish infants. METHODS: A five year population based case-control study with parental interviews conducted for each case and three controls matched for age, place of birth, and last sleep period. A total of 203 SIDS cases and 622 control infants born 1994-98 were studied. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis, co-sleeping significantly increased the risk of SIDS both as a usual practice (adjusted OR 4.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 17.37) and during the last sleep period (adjusted OR 16.47; 95% CI 3.73 to 72.75). The associated risk was dependent on maternal smoking (OR 21.84; 95% CI 2.27 to 209.89), and was not significant for infants who were > or =20 weeks of age (OR 2.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 70.10) or placed back in their own cot/bed to sleep (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.21 to 5.41). The use of pillows, duvets, and bedding with tog value > or =10 were not significant risk factors when adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, including maternal smoking and social disadvantage. However, the prone sleeping position remains a significant SIDS risk factor, and among infants using soothers, the absence of soother use during the last sleep period also significantly increased the SIDS risk (OR 5.83; CI 2.37 to 14.36). CONCLUSION: Co-sleeping should be avoided in infants who are <20 weeks of age, or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. The prone position remains a factor in some SIDS deaths, and the relation between soother use and SIDS is a complex variable requiring further study.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of non-violent, gender-based forms of maltreatment of women by husbands and in-laws [i.e., gender-based household maltreatment (GBHM)] during pregnancy and postpartum; to clarify the role of GBHM in compromising infant health, and whether this role extends beyond that previously observed for intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: Cross-sectional, quantitative data were collected from women (ages 15-35) seeking immunizations for their infants <6 months of age (N = 1061) in urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between maternal abuse (perinatal IPV, in-law violence and GBHM) and recent infant morbidity (diarrhea, respiratory distress, fever, colic and vomiting). Results: More than one in four women (28.4 %) reported IPV during their recent pregnancy and/or during the postpartum period, 2.6 % reported perinatal violence from in-laws, and 49.0 % reported one or more forms of perinatal GBHM. In adjusted regression models that included all forms of family violence and maltreatment, perinatal GBHM remained significantly associated with infant morbidity (AORs 1.4-1.9); perinatal IPV and in-law violence ceased to predict infant morbidity in models including GBHM. Conclusions: Findings indicate that non-violent expressions of gender inequity (e.g., nutritional deprivation, deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care during pregnancy) are more strongly associated with poor infant health than physical or sexual violence from husbands or in-laws in urban India. These results strongly suggest the need to expand the conception of gender inequities beyond IPV to include non-violent forms of gendered mistreatment in considering their impact on infant health.

AU  - Reeves N

T2  - Journal of Nurse-Midwifery
AB  - The experience of fatigue in early pregnancy was studied, using a general model of fatigue as the conceptual framework. A convenience sample of 30 women, age 20-35 years, who were at less the 20 weeks' gestation and without health problems were included in the study. Physiologic, psychological, and environmental factors were measured and related to the occurrence and intensity of fatigue. Pearson correlations and content analysis were used to analyze the data. Results showed that a large portion of the sample (90%) experienced fatigue and that this fatigue had a significant impact on their ability to maintain personal and social activities. Significant correlations were observed between fatigue and the physiologic variables of nausea and feeling tired upon awakening from sleep. There was no significant relationship between fatigue and environmental variables such as number of hours worked or the number of children living in the home. In addition, significant correlations were observed between fatigue and psychological variables that included depression, anger, anxiety, and confusion. These data suggest that fatigue is a significant problem for pregnant women and is not relieved by rest. These data further suggest that the fatigue may be related to other physiologic changes, perhaps hormonal, that mediate physiologic and psychological variables, including fatigue.

AU  - Webb AA
T2  - Evidence Based Nursing
AB  - Question: How is HIV related fatigue experienced and managed on a daily basis by people with HIV infection or AIDS? Design: A hermeneutic phenomenological study. Setting: An inner city medical centre in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Patients: 5 men and 5 women with HIV infection (mean age 33 y, 80% African-American) who reported that fatigue had developed since their previous clinic appointment. Fatigue was severe enough to affect activity levels. All participants were receiving disability benefits, lived alone, and 7 reported previous substance abuse. Methods: Individual, semistructured interviews of 30-60 minutes were done at the clinic. Topics discussed were personal meanings of fatigue, subjective responses to fatigue, contextual description of when fatigue occurred and the interpretation of the fatigue, the effect fatigue had on daily life, how each person managed the fatigue, and how the fatigue associated with HIV infection was similar or different from non-HIV fatigue. Audiotapes were transcribed, initial interpretations were made, and a team of content experts achieved consensus on the findings. The team consisted of an expert in each of phenomenological research, clinical management of patients with HIV, and fatigue research. Main findings: Thematic analysis identified 3 concerns for participants. The first, fatigue as a signal of AIDS, showed that fatigue was seen as a critical factor in the fight against the disabling effects of disease progression and AIDS. Because fatigue seas variable, participants continuously evaluated their own fatigue and compared it with that of others. Fatigue was seen as an indication of disease status. 'It's a danger sign. A lot of my friends, the ones that went on, that's how it started with them.' The second concern was the body, the mind the social experience of fatigue. The sensation of the body being tired was intense and was seen as being different from previous experiences with other conditions such as pregnancy and intoxication primarily because the fatigue was felt to be linked to disease progression. Emotional awareness of fatigue was linked to feelings of tearfulness, isolation, and lack of motivation and contributed to a depressed mood and fear of the future. Fatigue led to changes in social aspects such as isolation, frustration on the part of both patients and families, and family members taking on protective roles. 'It's like being stuck in a dark, cold, clammy room where you can't get out. You can't go nowhere, you're not really locked in a room, you just can't get enough motivation to get out of it. It's just there.' The third concern was choosing ways to live with fatigue and addiction and involved both personal understandings and actions. Participants chose to push themselves to fight the fatigue, accept the fatigue as inevitable, come to terms with the need to pace themselves, think positively, and improve their lifestyles. Participants felt the need to stop alcohol and drug abuse and to try to come to terms with their disease and its progression while balancing what was important to them in their daily lives. 'To sit around and mope about it is a sign of defeat so I find things to do. Then I go and try to take a little nap. You've got to keep your mind on the right perspective. You're not dead.' Conclusions: Among people with HIV infection or AIDS, fatigue was seen as a barometer of disease progression. Participants developed ways to deal with the fatigue both physically and emotionally to achieve their desired activities. [Original article accession number: 1998061427 (research)]

AB  - Fatigue, a common presenting symptom in primary care, negatively impacts work performance, family life, and social relationships. The differential diagnosis of fatigue includes lifestyle issues, physical conditions, mental disorders, and treatment side effects. Fatigue can be classified as secondary to other medical conditions, physiologic, or chronic. The history and physical examination should focus on identifying common secondary causes (e.g., medications, anemia, pregnancy) and life-threatening problems, such as cancer. Results of laboratory studies affect management in only 5 percent of patients, and if initial results are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated. Treatment of all types of fatigue should include a structured plan for regular physical activity that consists of stretching and aerobic exercise, such as walking. Caffeine and modafinil may be useful for episodic situations requiring alertness. Short naps are proven performance enhancers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline, may improve energy in patients with depression. Patients with chronic fatigue may respond to cognitive behavior therapy. Scheduling regular follow-up visits, rather than sporadic urgent appointments, is recommended for effective long-term management.

AB  - Background: Smart wristbands enable the continuous monitoring of health parameters, for example, in maternity care. Understanding the feasibility and acceptability of these devices in an authentic context is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second trimester until one month postpartum.Methods: The feasibility of a smart wristband was tested prospectively through pregnancy in nulliparous women (n = 20). The outcomes measured were the wear time of the device and the participants' experiences with the smart wristband. The data were collected from the wristbands, phone interviews, questionnaires, and electronic patient records. The quantitative data were analyzed with hierarchical linear mixed models for repeated measures, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.Results: Participants (n = 20) were recruited at a median of 12.9 weeks of gestation. They used the smart wristbands for an average of 182 days during the seven-month study period. The daily use of the devices was similar during the second (17.9 h, 95% CI 15.2 to 20.7) and third trimesters (16.7 h, 95% CI 13.8 to 19.5) but decreased during the postpartum period (14.4 h, 95% CI 11.4 to 17.4, p = 0.0079). Participants who could not wear smart wristbands at work used the device 300 min less per day than did those with no use limitations. Eight of the participants did not wear the devices or wore them only occasionally after giving birth. Nineteen participants reported that the smart wristband did not have any permanent effects on their behavior. Problems with charging and synchronizing the devices, perceiving the devices as uncomfortable, or viewing the data as unreliable, and the fear of scratching their babies with the devices were the main reasons for not using the smart wristbands.Conclusions: A smart wristband is a feasible tool for continuous monitoring during pregnancy. However, the daily use decreased after birth. The results of this study may support the planning of future studies and help with overcoming barriers related to the use of smart wristbands on pregnant women.

AB  - In recent years, the field of scientific and practical interest has shifted to ensuring the health of newborns and children that contribute to public health and future generations. The health of Russia's population, including reproductive health, to date, represents the State value. In recent years, in Russian Federation, there is a trend to an increase in fertility, including in connection with transition from 2012 registration of childbirth recommendations of the WHO with 22 weeks of gestation, but is directly proportional to increasing morbidity and mortality through early disability and perinatal morbidity. The highest frequency of adverse perinatal outcomes occurs in placental insufficiency, particularly in critical condition in the fetus, resulting in the subsequent health of the future generation. The aim of our study is to investigate the morbidity of babies in the first year of life birth on antenatal diagnosed critical state of the fetus. The highest perinatal mortality, high perinatal morbidity with the outcome of the disability we get at the critical state of the fetus, which should be understood as a degree of violation of the morphofunctional state in which the depletion of the compensatory mechanisms is the high risk antenatal, intrapartum or early neonatal death. According to various authors, the perinatal mortality rate in critical condition of the fetus reaches 9.3‰, early neonatal and 7.5‰. or the critical condition of the fetus characterized by early and very early preterm birth, severe perinatal CNS damage, respiratory distress syndrome, which subsequently affects the health status of children born in decompensated placental insufficiency. The aim of our research is the study of morbidity of children of the first year of life, born with antenatal diagnosed critical condition of the fetus. A clinical prospective study of 83 pregnant women with complicated critical to the fetus during pregnancy. The results of the study revealed high perinatal morbidity. Perinatal loss in the study group was 1.8‰ (N=15 ). Of the 8 surviving children, only 33 (48,5%) were observed later in the study of the catamnesis. When studying the history of the development of children during the first year of life with a critical antenatal diagnosed fetal-placental blood flow was noticed by the high frequency of infectious, allergic, neurological morbidity, abnormalities of bone and cartilage system of the visual apparatus. When analyzing the frequency and duration of monitoring by a neurologist, we have identified the expected high frequency of neurological pathology in children with antenatal critical condition. So, all children up to 1 year of life and further consisted on the account at the neurologist, which was due not only to the severity of CNS damage, but also by prematurity. The effects of neonatal ivh transferred 2-4 degree newborns manifested in children over 1 year of life in the form of hypertension-hydrocephalic syndrome in 5 children (15,1%), ischemic brain infarction in the region of the "island zone" with the subsequent formation of cystic leukomalacia in 1 child at 1 month of life. For these children, a characteristic diagnosis to the end of the 1st year of life was cerebral palsy (N=6, 18.2 %). It should be noted the high frequency of perinatal encephalopathy among children in this group (100%). Among the violations of psychomotor development we were allocated a syndrome of increased neuro-reflex irritability (restlessness, sleep disturbances, frequent and persistent vomiting) in 3 children (10,5%). The syndrome of autonomic dysfunction remained until 1 year of life in 24 (71,72%) children, premature live births, respectively gestational age was fading reflexes motor automatism, spinal reflexes, had a late start walking, crawling, ability to sit. There was a high frequency of diagnosis of retinopathy and risk of all children observed in the study of the catamnesis, which is natural, as in decompensated MON characteristic for newborns preterm labor, and abnormalities of cerebral blood flow including microcirculation in the body. For infants born with antenatal diagnosed with a critical condition of the fetus, characterized by high incidence of infectious disease (more than 2 times per year) in 7(21%) children by the end of 1 the first year of life. Allergic reactions manifest in the first year of life are clinically atopic dermatitis in 5 (15,1%), a high frequency which could be explained not only by prematurity at birth, but also the fact that the majority of children in this group were on artificial feeding. Thus, the results of the study showed that children born with antenatal diagnosed with a critical condition are at high risk of development of neurological pathology, physical, infectious, allergic morbidity, which may further entail the delay of psychomotor, speech development, with a likely outcome in the disability and social maladjustment.

AB  - Abstract: Background and Aims: In‐utero exposure to opioids including buprenorphine (BUP) has been shown to affect fetal activity, specifically heart‐rate variability (FHRV) and fetal movement (FM). Our objective was to extract simultaneous recordings of fetal cardiac and brain‐related activity in BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women using a novel non‐invasive biomagnetic technique. Design: A pilot study was conducted, recording and analyzing biomagnetic data from fetuses of BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women. Signals were acquired with the non‐invasive 151‐channel SARA (SQUID‐Array for Reproductive Assessment) system. Advanced signal‐processing techniques were applied to extract fetal heart and brain activity. Setting: University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA). Participants: Eight BUP‐maintained pregnant women from UAMS Women's Mental Health Program between gestational ages (GA) of 29–37 weeks who were treated with 8–24 mg of BUP daily. Sixteen pregnant women with no known opioid exposure in the same GA range were also included. Measurements: Outcome measures from the fetal heart and brain signals included: heart rate (FHR), FM, FHR accelerations, FHR–FM coupling, FHRV, fetal behavioral states (FBS) and power spectral density (PSD) of spontaneous brain activity. These measures were analyzed at three GA intervals. Findings: Fetal heart and brain activity parameters were extracted and quantified successfully from 18 non‐opioid and 16 BUP recordings. Overall analysis in both groups show that: FHR and FM ranged from 131 to 141 beats per minute (b.p.m.) and 5 to 11 counts, respectively. In the 35–37 weeks GA, the coupling duration (~9 s) was the shortest, while three of the FHRV parameters were the highest. The PSD of brain activity revealed highest power in 0.5‐4 Hz bandwidth. Transitions in FBS from quiet to active sleep were > 50% of sessions. Conclusions: This pilot study showed that a novel biomagnetic technique allows simultaneous quantification of cardiac and brain activities of a group of buprenorphine‐exposed and non‐exposed fetuses in the third trimester.

AB  - Four behavioural states are recognised in the human fetus and are comparable to those of the neonate: 1F (quiet sleep), 2F (active state), 3F (quiet awake), and 4F (active awake). State 5, or crying, is not considered to have a fetal correlate. In a study assessing the effects of exposure to tobacco and cocaine during pregnancy on fetal response and habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation, what appears to be the fetal homologue of crying was observed. These behaviours were seen on ultrasound, and have been captured on video recordings and include: an initial exhalation movement associated with mouth opening and tongue depression, followed by a series of three augmented breaths, the last breath ending in an inspiratory pause followed by an expiration and settling. This is the first report/video documenting these behaviours and suggests the possibility of a state 5F.

T2  - International Journal of Childbirth Education
AB  - This paper reviews available evidence on fetal and maternal sleep states during pregnancy. While the mother spends the bulk of her sleep time during pregnancy in NREM (non REM) Stage N2 (light) sleep, the developing baby spends the bulk of its sleep time in REM. Fetal REM is synchronized with maternal wake-rest activity schedules and is tightly coupled to respiratory physiology. Fetal REM exhibits hormonal and sensory signaling functions as well. The absence of sufficient fetal REM activity is associated with fetal distress and may be interpreted as a danger signal by the pregnant mother. It is suggested that maternal N2 NREM light sleep allows the mother to quickly awaken and respond to any danger signals received from internal or external sources. Near term NREM Stage N3 (slow wave activity) helps initiate birth contractions. At birth fetal REM is maximal and declines rapidly in the neonate.

AB  - Objective: We evaluated the possible association between fetal gender and long-term pediatric neurological morbidity.Methods: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort analysis comparing the risk of long-term neurological morbidity (up to age 18 years) of children born during the years 1991 to 2013 according to their gender. Neurological morbidity evaluated included hospitalizations in childhood involving pervasive developmental disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and infantile spasms and disorders of eating as recorded in the hospital files. Multiple pregnancies and fetal congenital malformations were excluded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare the cumulative neurological morbidity over the study period. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for obstetrical confounders, including gestational age at birth, birth weight, and maternal factors.Results: During the study period, 240,953 newborns were included in the long-term analysis: 51.0% (n = 122,840) males and 49.0% (n = 118,113) females. Hospitalizations for neurological problems (up to age 18 years) were significantly more common in males compared with females (1.1% vs 0.8%, respectively, odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001). Specifically, pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea were found to be significantly more common in males, and cerebral palsy reached borderline significance (0.1% vs 0.04%, odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.9, P = 0.06). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated males to have a significantly higher cumulative incidence of total neurological morbidity as well as of pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea (all log-rank test P values <0.001). In the Cox regression model, male gender exhibited an independent association with long-term neurological morbidity, while adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, and other confounding variables (adjusted hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001).Conclusion: Males are at an increased risk for pediatric neurological morbidity independent of gestational age at birth and birth weight.

TI  - Gender differences in sleep disorders.
AU  - Krishnan V

T2  - Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To evaluate recent evidence regarding gender differences in sleep. RECENT FINDINGS: Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns. Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more common in men. SUMMARY: Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy.

AB  - Objectives: Modern technology may have desensitised the 'biological clock' to environmental cues, disrupting the appropriate co-ordination of metabolic processes. Susceptibility to misalignment of circadian rhythms may be partly genetically influenced and effects on sleep quality and duration could predispose to poorer health outcomes. Shorter sleep duration is associated with obesity traits, which are brought on by an increased opportunity to eat and/or a shift of hormonal profile promoting hunger. We hypothesised that increased sleep duration will offset susceptible genetic effects, resulting in reduced obesity risk.Methods: We recruited 643 (male: 338; female: 305) European children born to participants in the New Zealand centre of the International Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints sleep study. Ten genes directly involved in the circadian rhythm machinery and a further 20 genes hypothesised to be driven by cyclic oscillations were evaluated by Sequenom assay. Multivariable regression was performed to test the interaction between gene variants and average sleep length (derived from actigraphy), in relation to obesity traits (body mass index (BMI) z-scores and percentage body fat (PBF)).Results: No association was found between average sleep length and BMI z-scores (p = 0.056) or PBF (p = 0.609). Uncorrected genotype associations were detected between STAT-rs8069645 (p = 0.0052) and ADIPOQ-rs266729 (p = 0.019) with differences in average sleep duration. Evidence for uncorrected gene-by-sleep interactions of the CLOCK-rs4864548 (p = 0.0039), PEMT-936108 (p = 0.016) and GHRELIN-rs696217 (p = 0.046) were found in relation to BMI z-scores but not for PBF.Conclusion: Our results indicate that children may have different genetic susceptibility to the effects of sleep duration on obesity. Further confirmatory studies are required in other population cohorts of different age groups.

AB  - Background: Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, considered endemic in modern society, are associated with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. Little, however, is known about the consequences of insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during pregnancy on glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes.Methods: A cohort of 1,290 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic testing for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were abstracted from medical records. Generalized linear models were fitted to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of GDM associated with sleep duration and snoring, respectively.Results: After adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, GDM risk was increased among women sleeping < or = 4 hours compared with those sleeping 9 hours per night (RR = 5.56; 95% CI 1.31-23.69). The corresponding RR for lean women (<25 kg/m2) was 3.23 (95% CI 0.34-30.41) and 9.83 (95% CI 1.12-86.32) for overweight women (> or = 25 kg/m2). Overall, snoring was associated with a 1.86-fold increased risk of GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94). The risk of GDM was particularly elevated among overweight women who snored. Compared with lean women who did not snore, those who were overweight and snored had a 6.9-fold increased risk of GDM (95% CI 2.87-16.6).Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest associations of short sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM. Though consistent with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger studies that include objective measures of sleep duration, quality and apnea are needed to obtain more precise estimates of observed associations.

TI  - Growing up in Ireland: Factors impacting sleep patterns of preterm infants.
AU  - Fallon, Joanne
AB  - Preterm infants represent the largest child patient group in the European Union (EU), accounting for 5.5-11.4% of all births (European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants, 2011b). Preterm birth is defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation. Infants born late preterm (34-36 weeks) are considered more similar to early preterm (> 34 weeks) than to full-term infants, despite previously regarded as near-term (Raju Higgins, Stark, & Leveno, 2006). For preterm infants, sleeping functions are critical as they demonstrate the ability to adjust to biological and social rhythms and support emotional regulation, learning, and memory. Many studies have focused on sleep patterns of full-term infants; however, few have investigated preterm infants and none have compared early and late preterm infants with a population from the Republic of Ireland. The purpose of this study was to identify infant and parent characteristics that promote optimal sleep in preterm infants and to establish whether the parent-infant relationship mediates this association. A secondary purpose was to test the transactional model of sleep. Parent report of infant sleep was taken from a recent population-based dataset from the Republic of Ireland. A comparison of the day and nighttime sleep patterns of early and late preterm infants found no difference between groups. There was also no difference in infant temperament, breast-feeding, parental stress, depression, or sociodemographics. A difference was found between groups in infant development, weight at 9 months, and age infant began solid foods. This finding was not surprising as infants born early preterm are at greater at greater risk of developmental delay and disability. Results of this study suggest that the paternal-infant relationship has a mediating impact on the relationship between infant temperament and nighttime waking in the early preterm group only, while the maternal-infant relationship has a mediating role in both groups. These findings add to the body of knowledge on the transactional model of sleep, and are the first to identify infant temperament and the paternal-infant relationship as important factors. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the transactional model of sleep and recommendations for future research are presented.

AB  - The objective was to identify guidelines in relation to self-care practices in pregnancy received by pregnant adolescents during the prenatal period. This is a descriptive, quantitative and transversal study conducted at the clinic of the Hospital de Clínicas, Federal University of Triângulo Mineiro with 30 pregnant adolescents. Data collection was performed in 2012 through home visits, using a script of sociodemographic characteristics and guidance received by pregnant women. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Most patients were aged between 16 and 19 years, had a steady partner, between seven and nine years of schooling, were homemakers, had a family income of one to three minimum wages. The most common guidelines were the importance of early prenatal care, the prenatal booklet, exams, vaccination, about smoking, alcohol intake, use of ferrous sulfate and folic acid. The less frequent information was related to weight control, healthy eating, physical exercise, balance between sleep and rest, practice of sexual activity and use of condom during sexual intercourse. The conclusion is that guidance provided during the prenatal period has biological approach and the guidelines with a holistic view on adolescents were carried out less frequently.

AU  - Swanson, Leslie M
T2  - BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth
AB  - Background: Depression is frequently observed in patients with untreated sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in the general population. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable since pregnancy increases the risk of both SDB and depressive symptoms. However, no study has investigated whether SDB symptoms prior to or in early pregnancy are associated with such mood problems.Methods: A retrospective chart review of pregnant women. Women were included if they attended prenatal clinics between June 2007 and July 2010, were ≥18 years old, pregnant with a single fetus, and had been screened for habitual snoring as well as depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS).Results: In total, 362 women were included and 32.3% reported habitual snoring. Twenty-nine percent of women had an EPDS score ≥10. Significantly more snoring women, compared to non-snorers, had an EPDS score ≥10 (42.7% vs. 22.9%, p < 0.001) despite the mean EPDS values not reaching statistical significance (6.1 ± 4.9 vs. 5.4 ± 5.0, p = 0.2). In a logistic regression model controlling for parity, the presence of pre-pregnancy obesity, presence of a partner, sleep quality, African American race, maternal educational level, pre-eclampsia, and diabetes, snoring was independently associated with a prenatal EPDS score ≥10 (O.R. 2.0, 95%CI 1.13-3.46; p = 0.023).Conclusion: Maternal snoring may be a risk factor for prenatal depressive symptoms. Further investigation of the temporal relationship between maternal snoring and depressive symptoms is warranted.

AB  - This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify 'red flag symptoms' suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a health coaching (HC) intervention designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), and promote positive psychosocial and motivational outcomes in comparison with an Education Alone (EA) group.Design: Randomized-controlled trial.Methods: Two hundred and sixty-one women who were <18 weeks pregnant consented to take part. Those allocated to the HC group received a tailored HC intervention delivered by a Health Coach, whilst those in the EA group attended two education sessions. Women completed measures, including motivation, psychosocial variables, sleep quality, and knowledge, beliefs and expectations concerning GWG, at 15 weeks of gestation (Time 1) and 33 weeks of gestation (Time 2). Post-birth data were also collected at 2 months post-partum (Time 3).Results: There was no intervention effect in relation to weight gained during pregnancy, rate of excessive GWG or birth outcomes. The only differences between HC and EA women were higher readiness (b = 0.29, 95% CIs = 0.03-0.55, p < .05) and the importance to achieve a healthy GWG (b = 0.27, 95% CIs = 0.02-0.52, p < .05), improved sleep quality (b = -0.22, 95% CIs = -0.44 to -0.03, p < .05), and increased knowledge for an appropriate amount of GWG that would be best for their baby's health (b = -1.75, 95% CI = -3.26 to -0.24, p < .05) reported by the HC at Time 2.Conclusions: Whilst the HC intervention was not successful in preventing excessive GWG, several implications for the design of future GWG interventions were identified, including the burden of the intervention commitment and the use of weight monitoring.Statement Of Contribution: What is already known on the subject? Designing interventions to address gestational weight gain (GWG) continues to be a challenge. To date, health behaviour change factors have not been the focus of GWG interventions. What does this study add? Our health coaching (HC) intervention did not reduce GWG more so than education alone (EA). There was an intervention effect on readiness and importance to achieve healthy GWG. Yet there were no group differences regarding confidence to achieve healthy GWG post-intervention.

AU  - Ahumada HT
T2  - Revista Panamericana de Salud Publica
AB  - The present study was conducted in a population living near a recycling plant for zinc and other metallic dusts to determine whether exposures to these substances were occurring and producing adverse health effects. The plant is situated in a suburb of Monterrey, which is the third most populous city in Mexico and the second most industrialized. A cross-sectional study design was used for the investigation, which was carried out from September 1994 to November 1994. Using cluster sampling procedures, homes in two areas were selected--one exposed through proximity to the plant, and the other unexposed to serve as a control--until the desired sample size was achieved (621 individuals, with an average of five per dwelling). A specially trained psychology student administered a questionnaire to an adult member of each family, soliciting data on the presence of acute and chronic infections, complications of pregnancy, and congenital diseases among the family members. One hundred twenty-seven questionnaires were administered in the exposed population, yielding information on 596 individuals. In the unexposed population, 147 questionnaires were administered furnishing data on 743 individuals. The sex and age distributions of the two populations were similar. The unexposed population had a slightly longer average duration of residence. The most common health problems in the exposed population were irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, allergies, sleep disturbances, bronchitis, excessive fatigue, skin problems, otitis, and anemia. The exposed population had significantly higher risks for skin eruptions and diseases, excessive fatigue, sleep disturbances, upper respiratory infections, otitis, bronchitis, and allergies. Exposed and unexposed women had comparable prevalences of obstetrical problems, spontaneous abortions, congenitally malformed offspring, and low birthweight. The questionnaire used to detect health problems has low sensitivity and may have generated underestimates of some conditions. Nevertheless, the analysis controlled for several different biases, and thus it can be concluded that a positive association exists between environmental exposure to these wastes and increased risk of disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Reduction of prone infant sleep position has been the main public health effort to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a stratified random sample of women after a live birth. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response). RESULTS: Overall, 9.2% of all women 'usually' chose prone infant sleep position, while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics (6.1%) or other sites (8.3%). Compared to health department prenatal clinic patients, private prenatal patients were more likely to choose prone infant sleep position, adjusted odds ratio = 4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-13.92). CONCLUSIONS: Health Department clinics have done a better job than private physicians in educating mothers about putting infants to sleep on their backs. Providers-especially private providers-should continue to stress the importance of supine sleep position for infants.

TI  - Health promoting behaviors, perimenstrual symptoms, and Chinese herbal use among childbearing-age Chinese American women.
AU  - Wey M
AB  - The Chinese are deeply influenced by traditional Chinese culture. Chinese herbal use is a common practice to enhance reproductive health. 'Good' menstrual health facilitates fertility and sets a positive stage for pregnancy during the childbearing years. Many Chinese Americans use traditional Chinese health practices, but they are less likely to disclose these practices. Although the upward trend of herbal use is more prevalent among women and ethnic minorities, little data are available about herbal use in these populations.The overall aim of this dissertation was to examine the influences of health promoting behaviors and the perimenstrual symptom experience on Chinese herbal use among childbearing-age Chinese American women from the theoretical perspectives of Chinese culture, women's health, and health promotion. This cross-sectional, descriptive study included 103 Chinese American women, 21 to 40 years, responding to self-administered questionnaires. Follow-up data were collected prospectively on a subset of the women regarding their perimenstrual symptoms during menstruation.Over 90% of women reported past use of Chinese herbs; 22% were current herbal users; and 70% had consumed Chinese herbs for relief of perimenstrual symptoms, with 55% to 95% of them experiencing relief. Current herbal users were significantly less acculturated. The primary reason for using Chinese herbs was enhanced sense of well-being. A majority of herbal users did not inform their Western health provider of their herbal use. Being less acculturated and engaging in nutrition-related health promoting behaviors were statistically significant determinants of Chinese herbal use.Most women experienced minimal severity of perimenstrual symptoms. Abdominal bloating, fatigue, and breast soreness were the most prevalent and severe symptoms reported retrospectively and prospectively. Uterine cramps were more prevalent during the menstrual period only. Although there were no statistically significant perimenstrual symptom differences between herbal and non-herbal users, women who reported a higher severity of sleep disturbance and emotional related perimenstrual symptoms were more likely to use Chinese herbs.Congruent with Chinese culture, which values health promotion, a majority of the women were relatively healthy and engaged routinely in health promoting behaviors. One such health promoting practice was the use of Chinese herbs for relief of perimenstrual symptoms.

T2  - BMC Pediatrics
AB  - Background: Preterm birth leads to multiple morbidities affecting the health of a child. Lack of information on the health impact of prematurity hinders the possibility of any effective public health interventions in this regard. Our aim was to determine the association between preterm birth and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) among 3 years old children in the Gampaha district, Sri Lanka.Methods: A community-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 790 preterm and term born children who were 03 years old. Multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used to identify children. The exposure status, a preterm birth, was established using the maternal pregnancy records. Outcome status was measured using a validated health related quality of life questionnaire (prepared in Sinhala) for preschool-aged children. Mothers of the children responded to an interviewer-administered questionnaire which had variables on the exposure status, outcome and additional variables such as child development status and birth related information. Quality of life was measured in twelve different domains of health (subscales). The impact was analyzed using the multiple linear regression.Results: Response rate was 95.5% (n = 379) for preterm group and 95.2% (n = 378) for term-born group. Health-Related Quality of Life scores obtained by preterm children were lower than the term born children in eight subscales. Preterm birth showed statistically significant association with subscales on sleep wellbeing, general wellbeing and abdominal symptoms in the adjusted analysis (p < 0.05). Among preterm children prolonged illness, delayed development status, socio economic status and maternal perception on the health status of the child were common predictors of quality of life.Conclusion: Preterm birth affected health related quality of life of preschool aged children.

AB  - The objectives of this study were a) to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among women with postpartum depression, b) examine the association between severity of depressive symptoms and level of impairment in physical and mental HRQoL and c) to identify contributors to physical and mental HRQoL. Seventy-eight women scoring > or =10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale completed the questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form SF-36), sleep quality, life stress, and social support. All women underwent a cardiovascular stress test to determine aerobic capacity. Compared to Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored significantly lower on all SF-36 domains, as well as on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean delivery, poorer sleep quality, life stress, and less social support predicted poorer mental health status.

AB  - Background: Up to 18% of men experience depression and/or anxiety during the transition to parenthood. Interventions designed specifically to promote the mental health of men during the transition to parenthood are scarce. Internet-delivered interventions may be acceptable and far-reaching in enhancing mental health, parenting knowledge, and healthy behaviors in expectant or new fathers.Objective: To guide the development of Healthydads.ca, a website designed to enhance mental health and healthy behaviors in expectant fathers, a needs assessment was conducted to identify fathers' perspectives of barriers to seeking help for emotional wellness, informational needs, and factors affecting the decision to visit such a website.Methods: One hundred and seventy-four men whose partners were expecting, or had recently given birth, in 3 Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta) completed a Web-based survey inquiring about information needs related to psychosocial aspects of the transition to parenthood, lifestyle behaviors, parenting, and factors associated with the decision to visit a father-focused website.Results: Most men (155/174, 89.1%) reported accessing the Internet to obtain information on pregnancy and spent an average of 6.2 hours online per month. Seeking information about parenting on the Internet was reported by 67.2% (117/174) of men, with a mean of 4.4 hours per month of online searching. Top barriers to seeking help to improve emotional wellness during the perinatal period were: no time to seek help/assistance (130/174, 74.7%), lack of resources available in the health care system (126/174, 72.4%), financial costs associated with services (118/174, 67.8%), and feeling that one should be able to do it alone (113/174, 64.9%). Information needs that were rated highly included: parenting/infant care (52.9-81.6%), supporting (121/174, 69.5%) and improving (124/174, 71.3%) relationship with their partner, work-family balance (120/174, 69.0%), improving sleep (100/174, 57.5%), and managing stress (98/174, 56.3%). Perceiving the website as personally relevant (151/174, 86.8%), credible (141/174, 81.0%), effective (140/145, 80.5%), and having an easy navigation structure (141/174, 81.0%) were identified as important factors related to a first website visit. Providing useful (134/174, 77.0%) and easy to understand (158/174, 90.8%) information, which was also free of charge (156/174, 89.7%), were considered important for deciding to prolong a website visit. Providing the possibility to post questions to a health professional (133/174, 76.4%), adding new content regularly (119/174, 68.4%), and personal motivation (111/174, 63.8%) were factors identified that would encourage a revisit.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that there is substantial interest among expectant and new fathers for using Internet-delivered strategies to prepare for the transition to parenthood and support their mental health. Specific user and website features were identified to optimize the use of father-focused websites.

AB  - This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional design was used with young women (n = 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named "mixed)", and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

T2  - Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The study was performed to evaluate the hypothesis that the extremely obese manifest sleep disordered breathing with a preponderance of hypopneas and relative paucity of obstructive apneas. METHODS: Retrospective review of 90 adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) matched for age and gender, comparing two groups, Group A: body mass index (BMI) < 35, Group B: BMI >= 45. Exclusion criteria: age < 18 years, pregnancy, >= 5 central apneas/hour, BMI >= 35 < 45. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Hypopnea/apnea ratio (HAR); secondary measures: obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive and central apnea indices, hypopnea index (HI), oxygen saturation (SpO2) nadir, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2), and presence of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Statistical methods: t-test for independent samples; Mann-Whitney, linear regression with natural log transformation, and Kruskal-Wallis [chi](2). Descriptive statistics were expressed as interquartile range, median and mean ± standard deviation, p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Group A (n = 45): age = 50.6 ± 11.5 years, BMI = 28.9 ± 4 kg/m(2); Group B (n = 45): age = 47.4 ± 12.7 years, BMI = 54.5 ± 8 kg/m(2). HAR was significantly higher in Group B (38.8 ± 50.7) than Group A (10.6 ± 16.5), p = 0.0006, as was HI (28.7 ± 28.6 in B vs 12.6 ± 8.4 in A, p = 0.0005) and AHI (35.5 ± 33.8 vs 22 ± 23, p = 0.03), but not apnea index. HAR was significantly higher in Group B regardless of race, gender, or presence of OHS. The BMI was the only significant predictor of HAR (adjusted r(2) = 0.138; p = 0.002) in a linear regression model with natural log transformation of the HAR performed for age, gender, race, BMI, and PetCO2. CONCLUSION: Extremely obese patients manifest OSAHS with a preponderance of hypopneas. CITATION: Mathew R; Castriotta RJ. High hypopnea/apnea ratio (HAR) in extreme obesity.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common and serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops during sleep, is associated with excess weight and obesity. Little is known about the co-occurrence of OSA among pregnant women from low and middle-income countries.Methods: We examined the extent to which maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity status are associated with high risk for OSA, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness in 1032 pregnant women in Lima, Peru. The Berlin questionnaire was used to identify women at high risk for OSA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to examine sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression procedures were employed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for putative confounding factors.Results: Compared with lean women (<25 kg/m(2)), overweight women (25-29.9 kg/m(2)) had 3.69-fold higher odds of high risk for OSA (95% CI 1.82-7.50). The corresponding aOR for obese women (≥30 kg/m(2)) was 13.23 (95% CI: 6.25-28.01). Obese women, as compared with their lean counterparts had a 1.61-fold higher odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.00-2.63).Conclusion: Overweight or obese pregnant women have increased odds of sleep disorders, particularly OSA. OSA screening and risk management may be indicated among pregnant women in low and middle income countries, particularly those undergoing rapid epidemiologic transitions characterized by increased prevalence of excessive adult weight gain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the developing fetal central nervous system (CNS) and related functional outcomes in infancy remain unexplored. Sleep and wake states of newborns provide a tool for assessing the functional integrity of the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether CNS integrity in newborns, measured with sleep recordings, was associated with maternal concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA. DESIGN: Plasma phospholipid fatty acid concentrations were measured in 17 women at parturition. On postpartum day 1 (P1) and day 2 (P2), a pressure-sensitive pad under the infants' bedding recorded body movements and respiratory patterns to measure sleep and wake states. RESULTS: Maternal plasma phospholipid DHA ranged from 1.91% to 4.5% by wt of total fatty acids. On the basis of previously published data and the median DHA concentration, the women were divided into 2 groups: high DHA (> 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids) and low DHA (</= 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids). Infants of high-DHA mothers had a significantly lower ratio of active sleep (AS) to quiet sleep (QS) and less AS than did infants of low-DHA mothers. Furthermore, the former infants had less sleep-wake transition and more wakefulness on P2. Correlations of maternal DHA status with infant sleep states were consistent with these data. Also, the ratio of maternal n-6 to n-3 fatty acids on P1 was inversely associated with QS and positively associated with arousals in QS. On P2, maternal n-6:n-3 was positively associated with AS, sleep-wake transition, and AS:QS. CONCLUSION: The sleep patterns of infants born to mothers with higher plasma phospholipid DHA suggest greater CNS maturity. Copyright © 2002 American Society for Clinical Nutrition

AB  - Objective:The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of home care practices in very to moderately preterm (VPT), late preterm (LPT) and term infants born in Massachusetts.Study Design:Using 2007 to 2010 Massachusetts Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data, births were categorized by gestational age (VPT: 23 to 33 weeks; LPT: 34 to 36 weeks; term: 37 to 42 weeks). Home care practices included breastfeeding initiation and continuation, and infant sleep practices (supine sleep position, sleeping in a crib, cosleeping in an adult bed). We developed multivariate models to examine the association of infant sleep practices and breastfeeding with preterm status, controlling for maternal sociodemographic characteristics.Results:Supine sleep position was more prevalent among term infants compared with VPT and LPT infants (77.1%, 71.5%, 64.4%; P=0.02). In the adjusted model, LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position compared with term infants (adjusted prevalence ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.97). Breastfeeding initiation and continuation did not differ among preterm and term groups. Nearly 16% of VPT and 18% of LPT and term infants were not sleeping in cribs and 14% of LPT and term infants were cosleeping on an adult bed.Conclusion:Compared with term infants, LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position after hospital discharge. A significant percent of preterm and term infants were cosleeping on an adult bed. Hospitals may consider improving their safe sleep education, particularly to mothers of LPT infants.

AB  - Postpartum psychosis has long-lasting consequences for mother and child. Beside depression, sleep and eating disturbances, exhaustion, social withdrawal, and anxiety, postpartum depression can also interfere with normal maternal-infant bonding and adversely affect child development. Recent reports show that most affected pregnant women are hesitant about taking antidepressant drugs, with a high percentage discontinuing their use. Some authors suggest that the reluctance of pregnant women to take antidepressant drugs should encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients the use of psychological interventions or alternative forms of treatment. In this article, a case of severe postpartum depression, treated successfully with homeopathic therapy, is presented. Considering the high noncompliance of women suffering from postpartum depression with conventional antidepressant medication, research in safe complementary medical methods is justified. One of these methods should be homeopathy.

AB  - In hospitals, women of reproductive age do a range of work tasks, some of which are known to carry potential risks. Tasks such as working with radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents, as well as performing heavy lifting or tasks requiring erratic sleep patterns have been reported to increase the risk of reproductive failures. Our aim was to study pregnancy outcomes in female hospital workers in Denmark. We performed a cohort study of 5976 female hospital workers and used as a reference group 60,890 women employed outside of hospitals. The reproductive health of hospital workers working during pregnancy is comparable to those of non-hospital workers for the majority of reproductive failures studied. However, an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities was noted in some subgroups of hospital workers, which may indicate that some hospital work still entails fetotoxic hazards.

AB  - Unlabelled: Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with significant maternal and infant morbidity are on the rise in Western society despite advances of medical technology. Current risk factors are insufficient to identify women at greatest risk of developing an adverse outcome. An attempt to identify novel contributors to increased risk is warranted. Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, yet are often dismissed as irrelevant. Emerging evidence indicates that sleep disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. Disturbed sleep is also linked with an increased inflammatory response. Increased inflammation is proposed as a key biological pathway through which chronic disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes develop. In this paper, we propose a model and a testable hypothesis of how disturbed sleep in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth via increased inflammation.Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Leaning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to outline data linking sleep disturbances with an increased risk of some systemic disorders, recall characteristics of pregnancy complications which support the hypothesis that sleep disturbances may be related to these pregnancy outcomes, and summarize the likelihood and types of sleep disturbances that are common in pregnant women.

AU  - Matheson, S. L.
AU  - Shepherd, A. M.
AU  - Carr, V. J.
T2  - Psychological Medicine
AB  - Background.True findings about schizophrenia remain elusive; many findings are not replicated and conflicting results are common. Well-conducted systematic reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size. In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia.Method.Reviews were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs that may be prone to bias.Results.High- and moderate-quality evidence shows that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections, childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), particularly in certain ethnic groups. Developmental motor delays and lower intelligence quotient in childhood and adolescence are apparent.Conclusions.We conclude that while our knowledge of schizophrenia is very substantial, our understanding of it remains limited.

T2  - European Journal of Clinical Nutrition
AB  - Objectives: To describe average levels of free-living energy expenditure in people from affluent societies and to determine the influence of body weight, height, age and sex. Design: Analysis of 574 measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE, assessed by the doubly-labelled water method); basal metabolic rate (BMR, directly measured or derived from similar directly measured proxy measures such as during sleep); activity energy expenditure (AEE, derived as TEE-BMR); and physical activity level (PAL, derived as TEE/BMR) from people aged 2-95 years. The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc). Results: A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11% less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated. Conclusions: There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.

AB  - A total of 14 healthy pregnant women between 37 and 41 weeks' gestational age were studied to determine the effects of a 5-second external vibratory stimulus (100 Hz, square wave) on human fetal behavioral states. Fetal behavioral state observations were made with simultaneous recordings of fetal heart rate, gross fetal body movements, and fetal eye movement between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM. During the first episode of behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep state) greater than or equal to 10 minutes duration on two consecutive half days, the vibratory stimulus was placed on the surface of the maternal abdomen over the fetal head. Each fetus received one 5-second vibratory stimulus during either the first or second half day of observation. The time at which the instrument was applied but no vibratory stimulus was administered was considered as the control period. All women were then observed for 2 hours after the control period and after stimulation. A transition period from a quiet sleep state to a stable active sleep state (state 2F, rapid eye movement sleep) averaged less than or equal to 3 minutes after stimulation, as compared with 23 minutes after the control period. These changes in fetal behavioral states persisted for 20 minutes after vibratory stimulation. There also was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term fetal heart rate variability, the number of fetal heart rate accelerations and gross fetal body movement during the first 20 minutes after stimulus, without changes in basal fetal heart rate. We hypothesize that changes in fetal behavior seen after application of low frequency vibratory stimulus are more physiologic than the profound changes in fetal heart rate and gross fetal body movement previously described after vibratory acoustic stimulation with an electronic artificial larynx.

AB  - Objective: To assess the frequency of obstructive sleep apnoea among women with and without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Design: Cohort study.Setting: Obstetric clinics at an academic medical centre.Population: Pregnant women with hypertensive disorders (chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia) and women who were normotensive.Methods: Women completed a questionnaire about habitual snoring and underwent overnight ambulatory polysomnography.Main Outcome Measures: The presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnoea.Results: Obstructive sleep apnoea was found among 21 of 51 women with hypertensive disorders (41%), but in only three of 16 women who were normotensive (19%, chi-square test, P=0.005). [Author correction added on 16 June 2014, after first online publication: Results mentioned in the abstract were amended.] Non-snoring women with hypertensive disorders typically had mild obstructive sleep apnoea, but >25% of snoring women with hypertensive disorders had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Among women with hypertensive disorders, the mean apnoea/hypopnoea index was substantially higher in snorers than in non-snorers (19.9±34.1 versus 3.4±3.1, P=0.013), and the oxyhaemoglobin saturation nadir was significantly lower (86.4±6.6 versus 90.2±3.5, P=0.021). Among women with hypertensive disorders, after stratification by obesity, the pooled relative risk for obstructive sleep apnoea in snoring women with hypertension compared with non-snoring women with hypertension was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.8).Conclusions: Pregnant women with hypertension are at high risk for unrecognised obstructive sleep apnoea. Although longitudinal and intervention studies are urgently needed, given the known relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension in the general population, it would seem pertinent that hypertensive pregnant women who snore should be tested for obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition believed to cause or promote hypertension.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify factors that influenced stress, healthy eating and physical activity among low-income overweight or obese pregnant women. We conducted seven focus groups with 96 low-income overweight and obese pregnant women. Common themes were identified from audio tapes and transcripts. Women said that poor communication affected their relationships with spouses or significant others. They were frustrated or upset with significant others for three key reasons: failure to understand or listen to the pregnant women's pregnancy concerns, refusal to be helpful when asked and being overly concerned with the woman's safety. Most women said that they were emotional and took naps throughout the day after becoming pregnant. Many withdrew from their social interactions. They also faced numerous challenges that made healthy eating more difficult, e.g., craving for unhealthy foods and eating foods for comfort. To eat healthier, some reminded themselves to avoid overeating or stop eating in the car. Women were not physically active because of tiredness, lack of motivation, inadequate social support, or bad weather. Some stayed physically active to prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain and have an easier labor. Women equivocally said weighing themselves to manage weight would add to their stress and make them feel more depressed. When designing interventions to help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women avoid excessive pregnancy weight gain, it is important to include information and practical advice on stress management, emphasizing effective communication skills with significant others and helping them plan effective ways to manage negative feelings.

T2  - Nutricion Hospitalaria
AB  - Immunonutrition is an emergent and interdisciplinary subject, since it comprises several aspects related to Nutrition, Immunity, Infection, Inflammation, and Injury or tissue damage, what is known as Nutrition and 4 “Is”. Within these interactions the endocrine, nervous and immune systems are involved, microbiota being a part of the last one. Nowadays, gut microbiota has been shown to play an essential role, not only in the gastrointestinal tract but also into the nervous system, because of its bilateral connection. There are several methods to study Immunonutrition, which allow measuring different immunological biomarkers to provide information about the nutritional status. However, it should be taken into account that there is not a single gold standard parameter to evaluate the cause- effect relationship between nutrition and the immune system. On the contrary, a combination of biomarkers have to be assessed depending on the different nutritional situations. Since Immunonutrition is a multidisciplinary matter as mentioned above, the study on the interactions between nutrition and the immune system has not been exclusively focused as such, but bearing in mind other systems of the organisms as well as a wide range of confounding factors and determinants coming from idiosyncratic features, genes and lifestyle of each individual. Therefore, Immunonutrition allows to study the following research fields: 1) Evaluation of nutritional status in presumably healthy people with risk of malnutrition (children, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, elderly, and sportspeople); 2) Assessment of the evolution and progress of patients with nutrition and immune-related diseases, such as food allergies, eating and metabolic disorders; 3) Evaluation of the effects of nutrients, bioactive compounds and both conventional and functional foods on the immune system; 4) Evaluation of impact of lifestyle determinants on the immune system, such as diet, food behaviour, physical activity, sedentariness, sleep quality and quantity, and as a key factor, stress.

AB  - Objective: Pregnant women often suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD symptoms are known to influence the quality of life; however, there is a lack of data in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to establish the impact of GERD symptoms on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during pregnancy.Participants and Methods: A prospective longitudinal cohort study to investigate the impact of GERD symptoms on the HRQOL was carried out in 510 pregnant women and 330 nonpregnant women as controls. Two validated questionnaires, the Reflux Disease Questionnaire and the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire, were used.Results: The study showed a significant negative impact on HRQOL in pregnant women with GERD symptoms. All five areas, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, vitality, food/drink problems, and physical/social functioning, were significantly reduced, but the most significant impact was on sleep (Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire score -35%). Overall, quality of life in women with GERD worsened throughout pregnancy.Conclusion: GERD is frequently seen in pregnant women and has a negative impact on HRQOL, especially in late pregnancy. Therefore, there is a need for adequate therapy of GERD in pregnant women and HRQOL could be an adequate monitoring tool in this population.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Parental incarceration (PI) is a prevalent adverse childhood experience (ACE) that has been linked to numerous social, emotional, and health problems in childhood and adulthood. A growing body of research has emphasized the importance of the timing of parent's incarceration on developmental outcomes. Study design The present study uses case–control matching to examine the impact of recent PI on newborn health and home safety outcomes. Methods Neonatal health and newborn sleep and home safety data, including rates of premature birth, low birth weight (LBW), neonatal intensive care unit admittance, breastfeeding initiation, safe sleep, and home environment (e.g. working smoke alarm, proper firearm storage), were collected from 108 women who completed the Virginia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring survey. Half of these women (n = 54) had experienced the incarceration of themselves or their partner during the previous 12 months. Participants were matched by age, race, income, and the education level with those of 54 women who completed the survey and who had not experienced incarceration in the previous year. Results Controlling for nicotine and alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other stressors, path analyses show that the women who experienced incarceration of themselves or their husband/partner were significantly less likely to deliver an LBW infant and more likely to live in a home with a loaded firearm in the home. No other significant differences emerged between the two matched groups among neonatal health or newborn sleep and home safety outcomes. Conclusions This result is considered from a public health perspective, as PI is an ACE which can be impacted by policy, particularly policies that promote practices that healthcare workers can use in correctional and other environments to encourage healthy pregnancies and home environments for newborns. Highlights • Parental incarceration is an adverse childhood experience that may impact newborn's health. • Parental incarceration was associated with higher rates of unsafe firearm storage. • Case–control matching revealed the impact of parental incarceration on newborn outcomes.

AB  - Infant mortality remains a problem in the United States with sleep-related deaths accounting for a significant portion. Known risk reduction strategies include breastfeeding, avoiding tobacco use and following the American Academy of Pediatrics' safe sleep guidelines. The purpose of this project was to evaluate outcomes of Safe Sleep Instructor-led community baby showers, which included safe sleep promotion, breastfeeding promotion and tobacco cessation education. Certified Safe Sleep Instructors (n = 35) were trained on how to plan and host a Community Baby Shower to provide education to pregnant women of low socioeconomic status or with high risk of infant mortality. Eighteen Community Baby Showers were held across two urban and eight rural counties in Kansas. Surveys were administered pre- and post-event to assess participant knowledge, confidence and intentions to follow through with planned action related to safe sleep, breastfeeding and reducing tobacco risk. Matched data were summarized and evaluated for differences using McNemar's and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. Significant increases were observed in Baby Shower participants' (n = 845) reported plans to follow the AAP Safe Sleep guidelines (all p < 0.001), likelihood to breastfeed (p < 0.001), confidence in ability to breastfeed for more than 6 months (p < 0.001), knowledge of local breastfeeding support resources (p < 0.001), knowledge of ways to avoid second-hand smoke exposure (p < 0.001) and knowledge of local tobacco cessation services (p = 0.004). Based on the result of the pre- and post-event surveys, certified Safe Sleep Instructors were able to plan and host successful events to increase knowledge and confidence related to risk reduction strategies to reduce sleep-related infant deaths.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a high-risk cohort.Study Design: This was a planned analysis of a prospective cohort designed to estimate the prevalence and trends of SDB in high-risk pregnant women. We recruited women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or greater, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, prior preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index of 5 or greater and further grouped into severity categories: mild SDB (5-14.9), moderate SDB (15-29.9), and severe SDB (≥30). Pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, infant weight) were abstracted by physicians blinded to the SDB results.Results: Of the 188 women with a valid early pregnancy sleep study, 182 had complete delivery records. There was no relationship demonstrated between SDB exposure in early or late pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, and small-for-gestational-age (<5%), or large-for-gestational-age (>95%) neonates. Conversely, SDB severity in early pregnancy was associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes (no SDB, 25%; mild SDB, 43%; moderate/severe SDB, 63%; P = .03). The adjusted odds ratio for developing gestational diabetes for moderate/severe SDB was 3.6 (0.6, 21.8).Conclusion: This study suggests a dose-dependent relationship between SDB in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational diabetes. In contrast, no relationships between SDB during pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth, and extremes of birthweight were demonstrated.

AU  - Mulliken JB
T2  - Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVE: During recent years, coincident with the recommendation to position infants supine, the incidence of posterior deformational plagiocephaly has increased dramatically. The purpose of our study was to determine whether early signs of cranial flattening could be detected in healthy neonates and to document incidence and potential risk factors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed in healthy newborns. Physical findings, anthropometric cranial measurements, and data on pregnancy and birth were recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of localized cranial flattening in singletons was 13%; other anomalous head shapes were found in 11% of single-born neonates. In twins, localized flat areas were much more frequent with an incidence of 56%. The following risk factors for cranial deformation were identified: assisted vaginal delivery, prolonged labor, unusual birth position, primiparity, and male gender. CONCLUSION: We propose that localized lateral or occipital cranial flattening at birth is a precursor to posterior deformational plagiocephaly. The infant lies supine, with the head turned to the flattened area, and is unable to roll. Intrauterine risk factors for localized cranial flattening are the same as for deformational plagiocephaly. To avoid postnatal progression from a localized cranial flattening to posterior-lateral deformational plagiocephaly, we suggest amending the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics on sleep position: Alternate the head position and allow sleeping on the side and, when awake, supervise prone time.

AB  - Study Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of "apple body type" to the STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).Design: Cross-sectional study.Setting: Sleep center setting.Patients: Two hundred and eight subjects who were referred for an evaluation of possible OSA at Tulane Comprehensive Sleep Center. The exclusion criteria were age<18years old, incomplete or absent questionnaire, incomplete body type identification, polysomnography (PSG) refusal, and pregnant women.Interventions: STOP-BANG items and body type data were collected on the initial clinic visit. An overnight PSG was performed on every participant.Measurements: Descriptive analyses of the demographic data and PSG variables were performed. The predictive parameters of STOP and STOP-BANG without and with body type score (STOP-Apple and STOPBANG-Apple) were compared.Main Results: The STOP questionnaire's sensitivity/specificity/positive likelihood ratio (+LR) (cut-off=2) was 96%/11%/1.1, respectively whereas the STOP-Apple questionnaire (cut-off=3) was 88%/39%/1.5. The STOP-BANG's sensitivity/specificity/+LR (cut-off=3) was 96%/19%/1.2, respectively whereas the STOP-BANG-Apple questionnaire (cut-off=4) was 90%/39%/1.5. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of STOP-Apple was comparable to the STOP-BANG (P=0.25). The addition of the apple body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire in participants with a score≥3 led to increased specificity (67.4%), increased the odds ratio of having OSA of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2-5.3) and odds ratio of having moderate-severe OSA of 4.7 (95% CI, 2.5-8.7).Conclusion: In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), ranging from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with increased behavioral morbidity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of school-aged children in an urban, community-based cohort, stratified for term or preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) birth status. A total of 829 children, 8 to 11 years old (50% female, 46% black, 46% former preterm birth) were recruited from a cohort study. All children had unattended in-home overnight cardiorespiratory recordings of airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and heart rate for measurement of the apnea hypopnea index (number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas per hour). SDB was defined by either parent-reported habitual snoring or objectively measured OSA. Functional outcomes were assessed with 2 well-validated parent ratings of behavior problems: the Child Behavioral Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised:Long. RESULTS: Forty (5%) children were classified as having OSA (median apnea hypopnea index: 7.1 per hour; interquartile range: 3.1-10.5), 122 (15%) had primary snoring without OSA, and the remaining 667 (80%) had neither snoring nor OSA. Children with SDB had significantly higher odds of elevated problem scores in the following domains: externalizing, hyperactive, emotional lability, oppositional, aggressive, internalizing, somatic complaints, and social problems. CONCLUSIONS: Children with relatively mild SDB, ranging from primary snoring to OSA, have a higher prevalence of problem behaviors, with the strongest, most consistent associations for externalizing, hyperactive-type behaviors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is known to be elevated in serum of patients with preeclampsia, but there are no data available on the significance of urinary VCAM-1 excretion in preeclampsia. The aim of our study was to uncover possible circadian rhythms of VCAM-1 plasma levels and urinary VCAM-1 excretion in uncomplicated and hypertensive pregnancies and to ascertain their relation to blood pressure. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 10 normotensive and 10 preeclamptic pregnant women were included in this study. Venous blood was collected hourly, and urine samples were taken every 2 h over a period of 24 h. VCAM-1 levels were determined by ELISA. We compared these results with the circadian blood pressure rhythm. RESULTS: The median VCAM-1 plasma levels were significantly (P < 0.01) increased in preeclamptic patients (851.5 ng/mL) in comparison to normotensive pregnant women (659.3 ng/mL) without any circadian rhythm being apparent; however, the urinary excretion of VCAM-1 showed a typical circadian rhythm, with a higher excretion rate during daytime. CONCLUSION: For the first time we have demonstrated that urinary VCAM-1 excretion in pregnancy shows a circadian rhythm without correlation to plasma levels or the circadian blood pressure rhythm. In contrast, VCAM-1 serum levels did not show a diurnal rhythm. We assume that VCAM-1 serum levels do not correlate with systemic blood pressure or urinary excretion.

AU  - Glynn, Laura M.
T2  - Journal of Women's Health (15409996)
AB  - Background: The purpose of this investigation was to determine if reproductive experience is associated with cumulative effects on human memory performance during pregnancy and if these effects persist into the postpartum period. Methods: Verbal recall memory performance was assessed in 254 women four times during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The relation between parity and memory function was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The data indicate that the previously documented adverse effects of pregnancy on memory performance are compounded with successive pregnancies. During gestation and postpartum, multiparity was associated with poorer memory function, and these effects did not appear to be due to differences in maternal demographics, depressive symptoms, or sleep quality. Conclusions: Animal models demonstrate that the effects of reproduction on brain structure and function are both cumulative and enduring. However, little is known about the influence of reproductive experience on the human female brain. These findings provide evidence that in humans, reproduction is associated with striking and perhaps persisting changes in cognitive function.

AU  - Noland M

AU  - Gessner BD
T2  - Public Health Reports
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Alaska Division of Public Health has stated that infants may safely share a bed for sleeping if this occurs with a nonsmoking, unimpaired caregiver on a standard, adult, non-water mattress. Because this policy is contrary to recent national recommendations that discourage any bed sharing, we examined 13 years of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred while bed sharing to assess the contribution of known risk factors. METHODS: We examined vital records, medical records, autopsy reports, and first responder reports for 93% of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred between 1992 and 2004. We examined deaths while bed sharing for risk factors including sleeping with a non-caregiver, prone position, maternal tobacco use, impairment of a bed-sharing partner, and an unsafe sleep surface. We used Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data to describe bed-sharing practices among all live births in Alaska during 1996-2003. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (n=126) of deaths occurred while bed sharing; 99% of these had at least one associated risk factor, including maternal tobacco use (75%) and sleeping with an impaired person (43%). Frequent bed sharing was reported for 38% of Alaskan infants. Among these, 60% of mothers reported no risk factors; the remaining 40% reported substance use, smoking, high levels of alcohol use, or most often placing their infant prone for sleeping. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all bed-sharing deaths occurred in association with other risk factors despite the finding that most women reporting frequent bed sharing had no risk factors; this suggests that bed sharing alone does not increase the risk of infant death.

AB  - Introduction: Maternal antenatal depression is associated with an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems in children. More recently antenatal depression has been associated with shorter sleep duration, higher number of awakenings and sleep problems in infants. Examining the effect of treatment of depression on child development is the next step in unravelling the complex association between antenatal depression and offspring development.Methods: We used data from a pilot RCT of women with antenatal depression who received either Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), to examine infant sleep duration and temperament two months postpartum. Data was available for n=14 in the CBT group and n=11 in the TAU group.Results: No differences by treatment arm were evident. Improvement in depression scores during pregnancy was associated with easier temperament (β=-.45, p=.024) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration (β=-.58, p=.003). The findings were more pronounced in the CBT group compared to the TAU group.Limitations: This was a pilot RCT and as such the sample size was small and there was some loss to follow up between the baseline and postnatal assessment.Conclusion: Improvement in antenatal depressive symptoms may have beneficial effects for the infant; whether these are directly through effects on foetal development or indirectly through changes in the postnatal mother-infant relationship remains to be determined.

AB  - Obstetricians may be a pregnant woman’s primary professional source of information about her infant prior to the birth, but infant safe sleep knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of this population are unknown. This study explores obstetric physicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and infant safe sleep and identifies barriers as well as enabling and/or reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with obstetric physicians who provide prenatal healthcare to women in Ohio. Surveys were sent to all licensed physicians included in the registry of the State Medical Board of Ohio with “obstetrics,” “obstetrics and gynecology,” or “maternal and fetal medicine” as their primary specialty (n = 1771). The response rate was 30%, with 418 physicians included in the analysis. Many participants were knowledgeable about infant safe sleep recommendations; however, only 55% indicated that it was important for obstetric physicians to discuss Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and/or infant safe sleep with prenatal patients. Many participants (70%) perceived barriers to providing infant safe sleep education, however most (82%) indicated interest in doing so. Participants’ knowledge and attitudes were significant predictors of whether they discuss this topic with patients. Obstetric physicians can influence the infant safe sleep decisions that women make. Improving obstetricians’ knowledge and attitudes about infant safe sleep and supporting physicians who wish to provide education on this topic may help to ensure that women are receiving frequent and consistent infant safe sleep messaging throughout the prenatal period.

TI  - Infant sleep and feeding pattern: effects on maternal sleep.
AU  - Thomas KA

T2  - Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health
AB  - Factors contributing to maternal sleep when infants are 4 to 10 weeks of age were examined. Twenty-four-hour sleep-wake diaries collected from 37 mother-infant dyads in the home environment were summarized to describe total, longest, and mean sleep period; synchrony of maternal and infant sleep; and feeding frequency and duration. Regression and post hoc analysis of variance were used to examine factors contributing to maternal and infant sleep. Maternal sleep is driven by infant sleep and feeding pattern. The minimum and maximum numbers of infant sleep episodes per day were 6 and 15, respectively, and mean infant total sleep was 13.47 hours (SD 1.73). Mean maternal total sleep was 7.18 hours (SD 1.51), with half of the mothers reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per 24 hours. Mean number of infant feedings was 11.14 (SD 3.27), with 11 infants (29.7%) receiving 13 or more feedings per 24 hours; minimum and maximum times per feeding were 15 and 41.7 minutes, respectively. Male infants had more sleep episodes, shorter sleep periods, and less sleep than females, and these gender differences resulted in shorter and more fragmented sleep for mothers. Findings suggest there is continued need for interventions to improve maternal sleep following childbearing.

AB  - Our goal was to examine associations of infant sleep and feeding patterns with maternal sleep and mood among women at risk for postpartum depression. Participants were 30 women (age ± SD = 28.3 ± 5.1 years) with a history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) who completed daily sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs to estimate sleep, and had their mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) during four separate weeks of the perinatal period (33 weeks pregnancy and weeks 2, 6, and 16 postpartum). They logged their infants' sleep and feeding behaviors daily and reported postnatal stress on the Childcare Stress Inventory (CSI) at week 16. Mothers' actigraphically estimated sleep showed associations with infant sleep and feeding patterns only at postpartum week 2. Shorter duration of the longest infant-sleep bout was associated with shorter maternal sleep duration ( p = .02) and lower sleep efficiency ( p = .04), and maternal sleep efficiency was negatively associated with the number of infant-sleep bouts ( p = .008) and duration of infant feeding ( p = .008). Neither infant sleep nor feeding was associated with maternal sleep at 6 or 16 weeks, but more disturbed infant sleep and more frequent feeding at 6 weeks were associated with higher HAM-D scores at 6 and 16 weeks and higher CSI scores. Sleep in the mother-infant dyad is most tightly linked in the early postpartum weeks, but mothers continue to experience disturbed sleep and infant sleep and feeding behaviors continue to be associated with mothers' depressive symptoms and stress ratings as long as 16 weeks postpartum. These data imply that interventions designed to improve maternal sleep and postpartum mood should include both mothers and infants because improving infant sleep alone is not likely to improve maternal sleep, and poor infant sleep is linked to postpartum depression and stress.

AB  - Study Objective: To determine whether preconceptional psychological distress is associated with infant sleep disturbance. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Southampton, UK. Participants: Acohort of women from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), who were recruited between 20-34 years of age and followed through their subsequent pregnancies and beyond; a total of 874 mother-infant pairs were involved in the study. Measurements and Results: Preconceptional psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). When their infants were 6 and 12 months of age, mothers were asked to report the number of times babies woke on average between the hours of midnight and 06:00 each night during a 2-week period. Preconceptional psychological distress was a strong predictor of infant night waking at both 6 and 12 months of age, independent of the effects of postnatal depression, bedroom sharing, and other confounding factors. At 6 months, preconceptional distress was associated with a 23% increased risk of waking (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.44), and at 12 months with a 22% increased risk (PR 1.22, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.02-1.46). Conclusions: Women with preconceptional psychological distress are more likely to have babies with sleep disturbance during infancy, independent of whether they suffered from postnatal depression.

AU  - Moon RY
T2  - Pediatrics
AB  - Objective: The goal was to evaluate pictures in magazines widely read by women of childbearing age, for adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for safe infant sleep practices. Methods: Magazines were included in this study if they had an average female readership of >5 million, circulation of >900 000, and median age of female readers of 20 to 40 years. Twenty magazines met these criteria. An additional 8 magazines targeted toward expectant parents and parents of young children were included, for a total of 28 magazines. Pictures of infant sleep environments and sleeping infants in articles and advertisements in issues of these 28 magazines were analyzed for adherence to AAP guidelines for decreasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Results: A total of 391 unique pictures from 34 magazine issues were included in the analysis. Only 57 pictures (64%) portraying sleeping infants not being held by an adult portrayed the infants in the supine position, and 14.8% of sleeping infants were portrayed as sleeping with another person. Only 36 pictures (36.4%) of infant sleep environments portrayed a safe sleep environment, as recommended by the AAP. Conclusions: More than one third of pictures of sleeping infants in magazines geared toward childbearing women demonstrated infants in an inappropriate sleep position, and two thirds of pictures of infant sleep environments were not consistent with AAP recommendations. Messages in the media that are inconsistent with health care messages create confusion and misinformation about infant sleep safety and may lead inadvertently to unsafe practices.

T2  - Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Back to Sleep campaign has been credited with recent declines in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome. Using survey data for the 1996-1998 birth cohorts, this epidemiologic study examines infant sleep position in a large, population-based sample. DATA AND METHODS: Data concerning infant sleep position are drawn from the 1996-1998 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for 15 states. Weighted multiple logistic regression analysis is used to examine correlates of infant sleep position. RESULTS: The prevalence of prone infant sleeping significantly declined between 1996 and 1998 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.63, 0.78]). African Americans were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone, (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.33,1.59), and were less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.57). Hispanic/Latinos were less likely overall than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.95), but were also less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.87). Adherence to sleep position recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics increased sharply among Hispanic/Latino infants. Very low birth weight infants and infants in larger families were less likely to sleep in the recommended supine position. Infants born between 1001 and 1500 g (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.79), and extremely low birth weight infants between 500 and 1000 g (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.72) were especially unlikely to sleep supine. Infants in households with more than 3 other children (AOR = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.74) were more likely to sleep prone. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of supine infant sleep increased between 1996 and 1998. Low adherence to sleep position recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics among African Americans, very low birth weight infants, and infants in large families remain public health concerns.

AB  - Background: Excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems are likely to emerge from the complex interplay of various factors.Aims: To investigate the role of infant (e.g., temperament), maternal (e.g., anxiety and depressive disorders), and familial (e.g., social support) factors as potential precursors of infant regulatory problems.Study Design: Prospective-longitudinal study.Subjects: 286 mother-infant dyads were investigated from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum via questionnaires and interviews.Outcome Measures: Regulatory problems at 2, 4 and 16 months postpartum assessed by standardized diagnostic interviews.Results: Fussy infant temperament and maternal anxiety disorders were associated with excessive infant crying (OR=1.16, 95%CI:1.05-1.29, OR=3.28, 95%CI:1.16-9.26) and feeding problems (OR=1.05, 95%CI:1.01-1.11, OR=2.27, 95%CI:1.36-3.80) whereas maternal depressive disorders were associated with infant sleeping problems (OR=2.55, 95%CI:1.06-6.11). Moreover, high maternal age (OR=0.86, 95%CI:0.75-0.98) was associated with a lower risk for excessive crying and being a single mother (OR=0.16, 95%CI:0.03-0.73) and cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions (OR: 0.59, 95%CI:0.36-0.96) was associated with a lower risk for sleeping problems.Conclusion: Excessive infant crying and feeding problems may be related to interactional deficits of anxious mothers who perceive their infants as "difficult" during soothing or feeding situations. Sleeping problems may be transmitted already during pregnancy by an altered sleep-wake-rhythm of mothers with a history of depression or by a genetic predisposition. Therapeutic interventions should focus on maternal anxiety and depression, behavior management techniques to cope with difficult situations with "fussy" infants and potential protective factors (e.g. favorable maternal emotion regulation) to address crying, feeding and sleeping problems.

AB  - Abstract: The aim of this research was to analyze the relation between coping strategies and somatic symptomatology in pregnant Spanish women and the influence of a previous miscarriage on these variables. We used a correlational retrospective design, which included 207 expectant mothers (44 with a previous miscarriage). The instruments included a questionnaire on coping with stress and questions about first-trimester symptoms. Regression analysis showed a significant positive relationship between sleep disturbances and overt emotional expression coping, between tiredness/fatigue and avoidance coping, and between nausea and religious coping. The influence of coping strategies on somatic symptomatology did not differ significantly between women who had had or had not had a previous miscarriage, although women with a previous miscarriage scored higher on the use of religious coping and positive reappraisal and reported more nausea.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the circadian rhythm maturation of temperature, activity and sleep during the first year of life in offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM) and its relationship with obesity markers. METHODS: A prospective analysis of the children of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) controlled with diet and 19 GDM with insulin). Fetal abdominal circumference was evaluated ecographically during gestation. Skin temperature and rest-activity rhythms were monitored for 3 consecutive days in children at 15 days and 1, 3 and 6 months. Anthropometrical parameters of the children were evaluated during the first year of life. RESULTS: Children from the GDM groups tended to higher fetal abdominal circumference z-score than controls at the beginning of the last trimester (p = 0.077) and at delivery (p = 0.078). Mean skin temperature or activity was not different among the groups. The I < O sleep index pointed to increasing concordance with parental sleeping at 3 and 6 months but no significant GDM-dependent differences. However, some of the parameters that define temperature maturation and also the circadian function index from the temperature-activity variable were significantly lower at 6 months in the GDM + insulin group. Fetal abdominal circumference z-score, as a predictor of fetal adiposity, correlated negatively with parameters related to circadian rhythm maturation as the circadian/ultradian rhythm (P1 /Pult ratio). CONCLUSIONS: Fetal adiposity correlated with a worse circadian rhythm regulation in ODM. In addition, ODM insulin-treated showed a disturbed pattern of the circadian function index of temperature activity at 6 months of age. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T2  - Seminars in Perinatology
AB  - The fetal biological clock is an endogenous clock capable of generating circadian rhythms and responding to maternal entraining signals. By at least the third trimester of pregnancy fetal diurnal rhythms are entrainable by maternal day-night rhythms. Maternal illness during pregnancy and premature birth are obvious clinical factors that may adversely affect circadian rhythm development. Premature birth of the fetus has a most dramatic impact on maternal fetal interactions. The effect on biorhythms appears to be temporary and is greatest on the most immature infants. The results to date support the importance of fetal circadian rhythms and the relative lack of these rhythms in the preterm infant. It is well known that growth and development in the prematurely born infant are influenced by a multitude of factors; clearly, the neonatal intensive care unit is not a surrogate for the maternal placental unit. This article reviews what is known about circadian development in the human infant with an emphasis on the unique circumstances of the preterm infant. The research on the short- and long-term effects of environmental interventions on circadian, sleep, and neurologic development is discussed. Although an earlier onset of circadian development did not result with cycled lighting in the neonatal nursery, there may still be important biological effects that have not been studied. There are sufficient data to state that there is no reason for continuing a chaotic, noncircadian environmental approach for the care of the prematurely born infant. Copyright © 2000 by W.B.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether the expression patterns of periphery clock genes were influenced by menstrual cycle in a monkey model.Study Design: In this preliminary study, the expression patterns of four clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Cry1 and Per2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 6 female Macaca fascicularis in menstrual, late follicular and mid luteal phases of menstrual cycle were determined by qrt-PCR.Results: Bmal1 and Per2 mRNA levels were found to exhibit significant diurnal rhythms in all phases of the menstrual cycle. The expression of Cry1 mRNA was statistically rhythmic in late follicular and mid luteal phases. A main effect of menstrual cycle existed on the rhythms of Bmal1, Cry1 and Per2 expression, but not Clock expression. No significant differences were detected between menstrual phase and late follicular phase in all clock genes. Significant differences were found on the expression of Bmal1, Cry1 or Per2 mRNA between late follicular phase and mid luteal phase, when no difference existed in estrogen level, indicating the role of progesterone on biological clock gene expression. Furthermore, the peak of Bmal1 mRNA level slightly advanced in mid luteal phase compared with that in menstrual and late follicular phases.Conclusion: The expression patterns of clock genes in PBMCs were influenced by menstrual cycle, potentially by the change of progesterone levels, and this effect maybe correlated with early pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to examine associations of objectively measured sleep duration with weight changes in black and Hispanic mothers over the first postpartum year.Methods: Data were from 159 mothers (69% black, 32% Hispanic). Nocturnal sleep duration was assessed using wrist actigraphy at 6 weeks and 5 months post partum, examined as a continuous variable and in categories (< 7 vs. ≥ 7 hours/night, consistent with American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendations). Body weights were abstracted from medical records in pregnancy and measured at 6 weeks, 5 months, and 12 months post partum. Outcomes included early postpartum (6 weeks to 5 months) and late postpartum (5 to 12 months) weight changes.Results: The majority of participants slept < 7 hours/night at 6 weeks (75%) and 5 months (63%) post partum. Early postpartum weight change did not differ by 6-week sleep duration category. By contrast, adjusted average late postpartum weight gain (SE) was 1.8 (0.7) kg higher in participants sleeping < 7 hours/night at 5 months post partum compared with those sleeping ≥ 7 hours/night (P = 0.02). Results did not show statistically significant associations of continuous measures of sleep duration, nor of measures of sleep quality, with postpartum weight changes.Conclusions: Sleeping < 7 hours/night was associated with late postpartum weight gain in minority mothers.

AB  - Introduction: Moderate exercise training during the pregnancy benefits both the pregnant woman and the fetus. The research papers consulted have linked physical activity with the reduction of the number of cesareans, instrumental delivery and with a more physiological delivery. It also prevents excessive weight gain in women and decreases the risk of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure.Aim: The aim of this research is to know if an exercise program of moderate character with Water Study Exercise Pregnant (SWEP) method, performed in an aquatic environment, contributes to have more favorable results in the perinatal period, both for women and baby.Material and methods: The design is a randomized clinical trial. The sample will consist of 364 pregnant women, with a total universe of 6,579 births occurred in Granada (Spain) during 2014. The sample was divided into two groups, intervention group and control group. The activity will be carried out in the water sporting facilities of the Faculty of Sports Science of the University of Granada, which have two pools suitable for our purposes: a 25-meter polyvalent pool and a 12.5-meter pool for training.Results: The exercise program designed specifically for the project called SWEP is performed from 20 to 37 weeks of gestation (SG), and it consists of three weekly sessions, with duration of 60 minutes each. Sessions will include three phases: warm-up phase, the main phase in which the exercise is divided into an aerobic phase and strength training and endurance training phase and a final phase of stretching and relaxation. The variables that will be studied are: a) Maternal: weight, BMI, blood pressure, O’Sullivan test, postpartum depression, level of self-rated health, sleep quality and perceived exertion during physical activity; b) fetal: weight, Apgar scores, head circumference and GA (Gestational age); c) peripartum: time dilation, expulsion and delivery, type of delivery, episiotomy, type of feed received by the RN and time of exclusive breastfeeding; and d) descriptive: age, occupation, education level, type of exercise done before and OF (obstetric formula).Conclusion: With aquatic moderate physical activity during pregnancy (method SWEP), we intended to improve the variables above.

TI  - Insomnia and sleep deficiency in pregnancy.
AU  - Reichner, Cristina A.
T2  - Obstetric Medicine (1753-495X)
AB  - Insomnia and sleep deficiency in pregnancy are very common with most women reporting sleep disturbances during pregnancy. Insomnia and sleep deficiency are also more prevalent as pregnancy progresses, possibly related to pregnancy-related physical symptoms or discomfort. There is increasing evidence indicating that these sleep problems may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes such as depressive symptoms, increased pain during labor, more Caesarean sections, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Treatment of insomnia remains challenging as some of the more commonly used sleep inducing medications such as benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may be associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Nonpharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy are available but the data in pregnancy is often lacking.

AB  - Context: Questionnaire studies linked symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Whether this association is present when OSA is assessed objectively by polysomnography is not known.Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between pregnancy, OSA, and GDM.Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted observational case-control studies using polysomnography in 15 nonpregnant, nondiabetic women (NP-NGT), 15 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (P-NGT), and 15 pregnant women with GDM (P-GDM). The groups were frequency matched for age and race/ethnicity. Pregnant women were studied during the late second to early third trimester.Main Outcome Measures: Comparisons of OSA diagnosis and sleep parameters between NP-NGT and P-NGT to assess the impact of pregnancy and between P-NGT and P-GDM to explore the association between GDM and OSA were measured.Results: Compared with NP-NGT, P-NGT women had a higher apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (median 2.0 vs 0.5, P = .03) and more disrupted sleep as reflected by a higher wake time after sleep onset (median 66 vs 21 min, P < .01) and a higher microarousal index (median 16.4 vs 10.6, P = .01). Among the pregnant women, P-GDM had markedly lower total sleep time (median 397 vs 464 min, P = .02) and a higher AHI (median 8.2 vs 2.0, P = .05) than P-NGT women. OSA was more prevalent in P-GDM than in P-NGT women (73% vs 27%, P = .01). After adjustment for prepregnancy body mass index, the diagnosis of GDM was associated with a diagnosis of OSA [odds ratio 6.60 (95% confidence interval 1.15-37.96)]. In pregnancy, after adjusting for prepregnancy body mass index, higher microarousal index significantly associated with higher hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose levels. Higher oxygen desaturation index was associated with higher fasting glucose levels.Conclusion: Pregnancy is associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep is more disturbed in GDM than in P-NGT women. There is a strong association between GDM and OSA.

AB  - Major depression occurs in 5-10% of pregnancies and is associated with many negative effects for mother and child, yet treatment options are scarce. To our knowledge, this is the first published randomised controlled trial on Internet delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) for this group.Objective: To test the efficacy of a pregnancy adapted version of an existing 10-week ICBT-program for depression as well as assessing acceptability and adherence DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial.Setting: Online and telephone.Population or Sample: Self-referred pregnant women (gestational week 10-28 at intake) currently suffering from major depressive disorder.Methods: 42 pregnant women (gestational week 12-28) with major depression were randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) provided at their antenatal clinic or to ICBT as an add-on to usual care.Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale-self report (MADRS-S). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and measures of anxiety and sleep were used. Credibility, satisfaction, adherence and utilization were also assessed.Results: The ICBT group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms post treatment (p < 0.001, Hedges g =1.21) and were more likely to be responders (i.e. achieve a statistically reliable improvement) (RR = 0.36; p = 0.004). Measures of treatment credibility, satisfaction, utilization, and adherence were comparable to implemented ICBT for depression.Limitations: Small sample size and no long-term evaluation.Conclusion: Pregnancy adapted ICBT for antenatal depression is feasible, acceptable and efficacious. These results need to be replicated in larger trials to validate these promising findings.

TI  - Interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy.
AU  - Pennick V
AU  - Liddle SD
T2  - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
AB  - More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain (LBP) and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. Pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 July 2012), identified related studies and reviews from the Cochrane Back Review Group search strategy to July 2012, and checked reference lists from identified reviews and studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic or back pain in pregnancy. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Quality of the evidence for outcomes was assessed using the five criteria outlined by the GRADE Working Group. We included 26 randomised trials examining 4093 pregnant women in this updated review. Eleven trials examined LBP (N = 1312), four examined pelvic pain (N = 661), and 11 trials examined lumbo-pelvic (LBP and pelvic) pain (N = 2120). Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to the results of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and unless noted, were compared to usual prenatal care. For LBP, there was low-quality evidence that in general, the addition of exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to -0.53; six RCTs, N = 543), and disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; two RCTs, N = 146); and water-based exercise significantly reduced LBP-related sick leave (risk ratio (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92; one RCT, N = 241). Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested no significant difference in pain or function between two types of pelvic support belt, between osteopathic manipulation (OMT) and usual care or sham ultrasound (sham US). Very low-quality evidence suggested that a specially-designed pillow may relieve night pain better than a regular pillow. For pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture significantly reduced evening pain better than exercise; both were better than usual care. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that adding a rigid belt to exercise improved average pain but not function; acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture for improving evening pain and function, but not average pain; and evening pain relief was the same following either deep or superficial acupuncture. For lumbo-pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that an eight- to 20-week exercise program reduced the risk of women reporting lumbo-pelvic pain (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; four RCTs, N = 1344); but a 16- to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual care at preventing pelvic pain (one RCT, N = 257). Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced lumbo-pelvic-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, two RCTs, N = 1062), and improved function. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that OMT significantly reduced pain and improved function; either a multi-modal intervention that included manual therapy, exercise and education (MOM) or usual care significantly reduced disability, but only MOM improved pain and physical function; acupuncture improved pain and function more than usual care or physiotherapy; pain and function improved more when acupuncture was started at 26- rather than 20- weeks' gestation; and auricular (ear) acupuncture significantly improved these outcomes more than sham acupuncture.When reported, adverse events were minor and transient. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the stage of pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbo-pelvic pain more than usual care alone, acupuncture was significantly more effective than exercise for reducing evening pelvic pain, and a 16- to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual prenatal care at preventing pelvic or LBP. Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from LBP.There was low-quality evidence from single trials for other outcomes because of high risk of bias and sparse data; clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out.Physiotherapy, OMT, acupuncture, a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more than usual care alone. Acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy at relieving evening lumbo-pelvic pain and disability and improving pain and function when it was started at 26- rather than 20-weeks' gestation, although the effects were small.There was no significant difference in LBP and function for different support belts, exercise, neuro emotional technique or spinal manipulation (SMT), or in evening pelvic pain between deep and superficial acupuncture.Very low-quality evidence suggested a specially-designed pillow may reduce night-time LBP.Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates. Future research would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to presenting symptoms.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Background Underutilisation of antenatal care services due to intimate partner violence during pregnancy has been well documented elsewhere, but it is understudied in Nepal. Our study aimed at exploring the impact of intimate partner violence on antenatal care service utilisation in southern Terai of Nepal. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was performed in 6 village development committees in Dhanusha district, Nepal. A total of 426 pregnant women in their second trimester were selected using a multistage cluster sampling method. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association between exposure to intimate partner violence and selected antenatal care services, adjusting for covariates. Results Among 426 pregnant women, almost three out of ten women (28.9%) were exposed to intimate partner violence at some point during their pregnancy. Pregnant women who were exposed to intimate partner violence were less likely to: register for antenatal care (OR 0.31; 95% CI (0.08–0.50)), take iron and folic acid (OR 0.55; 95% CI (0.12–0.90)), report dietary diversity (middle vs low: OR 0.34; 95% CI (0.11–0.58) and high vs low: OR 0.18; 95% CI (0.08–0.37)), have rest and sleep during day time (OR 0.47; 95% CI (0.61–0.58)), and attend mother’s group meetings (OR 0.29; 95% CI (0.10–0.83)). Conclusions Intimate partner violence during pregnancy is associated with low utilisation of antenatal care services. Therefore, effective strategies to prevent or reduce intimate partner violence during pregnancy is needed, which may lead to improved antenatal care service utilization in Nepal with healthier mothers and children’s outcome.

T2  - Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is more common during pregnancy than in the general population, occurring at a 2-3 times higher prevalence. While iron, genetics, and central nervous system dopamine have been shown to play major roles in RLS unrelated to pregnancy, the etiology and treatment of RLS during pregnancy have not been adequately delineated. We describe a novel approach where a 23-year-old female was given intravenous iron prior to pregnancy, with complete remission of RLS symptoms until five months postpartum. Factors other than iron status that may have influenced the course of remission and relapse were oral contraceptive use, antidepressant use, and a strong family history of RLS.

AB  - Background: Although medication is generally avoided wherever possible during pregnancy, pharmacotherapy is required for the treatment of pregnancy associated hypertension, which remains a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The long-term effects to the child of in-utero exposure to antihypertensive agents remains largely unknown.Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review published studies on adverse outcomes to the child associated with in-utero exposure to antihypertensive medications.Methods: OVID, Scopus, EBSCO Collections, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant publications published between January 1950 and October 2016 and a total of 688 potentially eligible studies were identified.Results: Following review, 47 primary studies were eligible for inclusion. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist was used to assess study quality. Five studies were of excellent quality; the remainder were either mediocre or poor. Increased risk of low birth weight, low size for gestational age, preterm birth, and congenital defects following in-utero exposure to all antihypertensive agents were identified. Two studies reported an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder following exposure to labetalol, and an increased risk of sleep disorders following exposure to methyldopa and clonidine.Conclusion: The current systematic review demonstrates a paucity of relevant published high-quality studies. A small number of studies suggest possible increased risk of adverse child health outcomes; however, most published studies have methodological weaknesses and/or lacked statistical power thus preventing any firm conclusions being drawn.

TI  - Investigating the relationship between sleep and postpartum depression: a longitudinal study examining the relationships between subjective and objective sleep during the perinatal period and postpartum depression.
AU  - Kita, L
AB  - Research has suggested that a bi-directional relationship exists between sleep disruption and depression. Not only is poor sleep a commonly reported symptom in those with depression, some aspects of sleep have also been shown to predict the onset of depression. Despite sleep problems being a commonly reported occurrence throughout the perinatal period, the field of perinatal sleep research remains in its relative infancy. However, recent studies suggest that sleep disturbances during this time may increase the risk of developing postpartum depression. Currently, research in this area is limited by studies that have failed to control for depressive symptoms at baseline, relied upon subjective, often retrospective, measures of sleep, and have only measured symptoms of postpartum depression in the early postpartum period. Few studies have used polysomnography, considered the gold standard of sleep, and no studies to date have specifically compared the relationship between subjective and objective sleep. Therefore, the major aim of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the specific aspects of sleep that were most relevant to postpartum depression. In order to address this aim, studies were carried out to: explore the aspects of sleep most relevant to major depressive disorder; examine differences in sleep between pregnant and non-pregnant women; investigate the relationships between subjective and objective measures of sleep; explore longitudinal changes in sleep, fatigue and depression throughout the perinatal period, and finally; examine which aspects of sleep at which time-point were most relevant to the development of postpartum depression. .Overall this thesis found that women experience significant changes to their sleep throughout the perinatal period. While the sleep of third trimester women is considerably poorer than that of non-pregnant women (both objectively and subjectively), the most significant changes occur in the transition between late pregnancy and the early postpartum period. Furthermore, increased amounts of sleep and reports of difficulty falling asleep during late pregnancy predicted the development of postpartum depressive symptoms. This suggests that certain aspects of sleep during late pregnancy may serve as markers for women at risk of developing postpartum depression..

AB  - Ramadan is observed by 1.6 billion Muslims. In an accompanying article that uses data from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Burkina Faso, Schoeps et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(10):2085–2092) find that exposure to Ramadan in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of mortality among children under age 5 years. Ramadan exposes observant individuals to a specific pattern of nutrition and other behaviors, including changes in sleep patterns. How these behaviors might result in child mortality is not yet understood, and the findings reported in this paper should be replicated in other settings.

TI  - Is fetal analgesia necessary during prenatal surgery?
AU  - Bellieni, Carlo V.
AU  - Vannuccini, Silvia
AU  - Petraglia, Felice
T2  - Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine
AB  - Fetal pain and fetal anesthesia are still matter of debate: some authors hypothesize that several intrauterine endocrine neuroinhibitors (ENIn) anesthetize the fetus, keeping it in a constant state of sleep, and making pharmacological fetal anesthesia useless for fetal surgery, while others argue fetal pain is possible and shoud be prevented with fetal anesthesy.Aim: To retrieve evidences about fetal pain, fetal arousability and about the level of sedation induced by the ENIn, in order to assess the necessity of direct fetal anesthesia during prenatal fetal surgery.Methods: We performed a careful literature review (1990-2016) on fetal arousability, and on the possibility that ENIn at the average fetal blood levels induce actual anesthesia. We retrieved the papers that fulfilled the research criteria, with particular attention to the second half of pregnancy, the period when most fetal surgery is performed.Results: Fetuses are awake about 10% of the total time in the last gestational weeks, and they can be aroused by external stimuli. ENIn have not an anesthetic effect at normal fetal values, but only when they areartificialy injected at high doses; their blood levels in the last trimester of average pregnancies are not dissimilar either in the fetus or in the mother.Conclusions: During the second half of the pregnancy, external stimuli can awake the fetuses, although they spend most of the time in sleeping state; the presence of ENIn is absolutely not enough to guarantee an effective anesthesia during surgery. Thus, direct fetal analgesia/anesthesia is mandatory, though further studies on its possible drawbacks are necessary.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by passive smoking. In this study we investigated the effects of passive smoking on sleep disturbance during pregnancy. DESIGN: Two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys conducted in 2002 and 2006. SETTING: Clinical institutions specializing in obstetrics and gynecology that participated in the nationwide surveys: 260 in the 2002 survey and 344 in the 2006 survey. PARTICIPANTS: 16,396 and 19,386 pregnant women in Japan surveyed in 2002 and 2006, respectively. INTERVENTION: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Pregnant women exposed to passive smoking were likely to have sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably. Smoking pregnant women had the same sleep disturbances and also experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and early morning awakening. The prevalence of 5 types of sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably) among nonsmokers with environmental tobacco smoke showed a mean value intermediate between that of active smokers and that of nonsmokers without environmental tobacco smoke. CONCLUSION: Passive smoking is independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy.

T2  - Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine
AB  - Heart disease remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in women in the United States and worldwide. This review highlights known and emerging risk factors for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in women. Traditional Framingham risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, as well as lifestyle habits such as unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle are all modifiable. Health care providers should be aware of emerging cardiac risk factors in women such as adverse pregnancy outcomes, systemic autoimmune disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and radiation-induced heart disease; psychosocial factors such as mental stress, depression, anxiety, low socioeconomic status, and work and marital stress play an important role in IHD in women. Appropriate recognition and management of an array of risk factors is imperative given the growing burden of IHD and need to deliver cost-effective, quality care for women.

AB  - Background: Although the WHO recommends that complementary feeding in infants should begin at 6 mo of age, it often begins before this in developed countries.Objective: Our objective was to determine whether lactation consultant (LC) support, with educational resources given at 4-mo postpartum, can delay the introduction of complementary foods until around 6 mo of age.Methods: A total of 802 mother-infant pairs were recruited from the single maternity hospital serving Dunedin, New Zealand (59% response rate) and randomly assigned to the following: 1) usual care (control group); 2) infant sleep education intervention (Sleep); 3) food, activity, and breastfeeding intervention (FAB); or 4) combination (both) intervention (Combo). Certified LCs delivered 3 intervention sessions (late pregnancy and 1-wk and 4-mo postpartum). The 4-mo contact used educational resources focused on developmental readiness for complementary foods. Age when complementary foods were introduced was obtained from repeated interviews (monthly from 3- to 27-wk postpartum).Results: A total of 49.5% and 87.2% of infants received complementary foods before 5 and 6 mo of age, respectively. There was evidence of group differences in the number of infants introduced to complementary foods before 5 mo (P = 0.006), with those receiving support and resources (FAB and Combo groups combined; 55.6%) more likely to wait until at least 5 mo compared with controls (control and Sleep groups combined; 43.3%) (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.16). However, there was no evidence they were more likely to wait until 6 mo of age (P = 0.52). Higher maternal age, higher parity, and a less positive attitude toward breastfeeding were positively associated, and drinking alcohol during pregnancy was negatively associated, with later age of introduction of complementary foods.Conclusions: Providing an LC and educational resources at 4-mo postpartum to predominantly well-educated, mainly European, women can delay the introduction of complementary foods until 5 mo of age, but not until the WHO recommendation of 6 mo. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00892983.

AU  - Kipnis, Gayle J.
AU  - Lee, Kathryn
T2  - JOGNN: Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing
AB  - Poster Presentation Objective To ascertain whether the quality and quantity of sleep in late pregnancy were associated with length of labor or mode of delivery (vaginal/cesarean) for women living at moderate altitude. Design A prospective, descriptive study based on the symptom management theory, the theory of integral nursing, and Lee's conceptual model of impaired sleep. Setting Flagstaff, Arizona (elevation 6910 ft.) February to July 2011. Sample Convenience sample of 50 nulliparous women who completed 35 gestational weeks of pregnancy. Methods Institutional Review Board and Committee on Human Research approvals were obtained, and all participants signed informed consent. Sleep booklets were completed during the last 5 weeks of pregnancy. Participants were contacted by phone 2 to 4 weeks postdelivery to collect birth information. Analyses included Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, hierarchical multiple regression to explore relationships between sleep and length of labor, and logistic regression to predict mode of delivery from sleep parameters. Results After controlling for infant birth weight (beta = .315, R2 change = 8.0%, p < .05), length of labor was associated with self-reported sleep onset latency (beta = .593, R2 change = 21.7%, p < .001). Together, infant birth weight, maternal weight, age, income, sleep onset latency, hours of sleep, sleep disturbance, and sleep quality accounted for 51.6% of the variance in length of labor. For each additional minute it took to fall asleep, length of labor increased by 12 minutes. In this sample, utilizing the same variables and covariates in a logistic regression, late pregnancy sleep parameters were not predictive of mode of delivery. Conclusion/Implications for Nursing Practice This is the first research conducted at moderate altitude focused on late pregnancy sleep to explore relationships with perinatal outcomes. Because greater sleep disturbance and sleep onset latency were related to poor quality of sleep, obstetric care providers should advise women in late pregnancy to practice healthy sleep hygiene measures.

AB  - Sleep disturbance during pregnancy can result in excessive daytime sleepiness, diminished daytime performance, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the potential for an increased length of labor and increased risk of operative birth. Sleep disturbance may be the result of a sleep disorder, such as leg cramps, a common yet benign disorder, or restless legs syndrome, a sensorimotor disorder. Both disrupt sleep, are distressing to the pregnant woman, and mimic one another and other serious disorders. During pregnancy, up to 30% of women can be affected by leg cramps, and up to 26% can be affected by restless legs syndrome.

AB  - Eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care is a national priority, and obesity is a prime target. During the last 30 y in the United States, the prevalence of obesity among children has dramatically increased, sparing no age group. Obesity in childhood is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes and with other long-term adverse outcomes, including both physical and psychosocial consequences. By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present, suggesting that disparities in childhood obesity prevalence have their origins in the earliest stages of life. Several risk factors during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of offspring obesity, including excessive maternal gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, smoking during pregnancy, antenatal depression, and biological stress. During infancy and early childhood, rapid infant weight gain, infant feeding practices, sleep duration, child's diet, physical activity, and sedentary practices are associated with the development of obesity. Studies have found substantial racial/ethnic differences in many of these early life risk factors for childhood obesity. It is possible that racial/ethnic differences in early life risk factors for obesity might contribute to the high prevalence of obesity among minority preschool-age children and beyond. Understanding these differences may help inform the design of clinical and public health interventions and policies to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity and eliminate disparities among racial/ethnic minority children.

AB  - Objective: To compare health and lifestyle factors of people with and without urinary incontinence (UI). Design: A postal survey was undertaken that represents the first of a 3-stage project designed to evaluate the health interventions of primary health care teams and continence advisory services on patient outcomes related to UI. Setting and Subjects: Two random samples of adult populations (N = 12,529) were included, generated from the family physician patient registers within 2 health authorities in England. Instruments: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that queried demography, perceived health status, activities of daily living, self-care, and use of local health and social services. Information was also collected on past and present continence status. Methods: Structured questionnaires and a cover letter were mailed to the target population. Two reminders were sent to nonresponders to maximize the response rate. Main Outcome Measures: The main measures relate to factors associated with UI: mobility, sleep, childbirth, smoking, diet, body mass index, and accommodation. Results: Significantly more women than men had UI (P < .0001). Respondents with UI were older than those who were continent (P < .0001). Women with UI were significantly more likely to have a greater number of pregnancies (P < .0001), were more likely to have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 lb (P < .01), and to have had more than 4 children (P = .01) compared with women who were continent. People with UI were less likely to be single and more likely to be widowed than those who were continent (P < .0001). People who lived alone and who had UI were also significantly less likely to have a relative or friend that they could depend on for help than those who were continent (P < .001). UI was also found to be significantly associated with impaired mobility (P < .0001) and sleeping difficulties (P < .0001). No meaningful differences were found between diet and UI, although significantly more people with UI had higher mean body mass index, were obese, or reported that they felt too heavy for their height when compared with people who were continent (P < .0001). No association was found in the present study with smoking or ethnicity and UI. Conclusions: Key health and lifestyle factors associated with UI included age, gender, childbirth, mobility, sleep patterns, obesity, living alone, and access to help. These factors should be assessed when planning and implementing health care for persons with UI. Attention to these associated factors may prove useful in identifying new cases or people at risk of developing UI when screening people as part of routine health checks. This, in turn, could assist with targeting effective and efficient health care but may also contribute to prevention for some people.

AB  - Background: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a larger prospective cohort study, which will aim at determining the independent contribution of male and female lifestyle-related factors to assisted reproductive technology (ART) success. The study also examined whether couples seeking fertility treatments present lifestyle-related factors that may interfere with their reproductive health. Materials and Methods: This prospective pilot study was conducted in a fertility clinic between May 2015 and February 2016. Feasibility factors evaluated were recruitment rates, compliance with the protocol, retention rate and ART outcomes at six-month follow-up. Anthropometric profile and lifestyle habits of both partners were evaluated before the beginning of infertility treatments. Results: We approached 130 eligible infertile couples. Among them, 32 (25%) agreed to participate and 28 (88%) complied with the protocol. At six-month follow-up, seven couples (25%) did not start, or stop, infertility treatments and 13 couples (62%) achieved a clinical pregnancy. Among the 28 couples included in the analyses, 16% of the partners were obese and 23% had abdominal obesity. The majority of the subjects were still drinking alcohol (84%). Sixty-eight percent of women needed improvement in their diet (vs. 95% of men, P=0.05) and none of them achieved the Canadian recommendations for physical activity (vs. 33% of men, P=0.001). Moreover, 35% of the partners had a poor sleep quality. Overall, women presented a worse reproductive health profile than men, with 3.1 and 2.4 out of seven adverse factors, respectively (P=0.04). Conclusion: Conducting a large prospective cohort study in our fertility clinic will be feasible but recruitment and compliance with the protocol need to be improved. Many women and men seeking fertility treatments present unfavourable lifestyle-related factors that may explain, at least partially, their difficulties in conceiving.

TI  - Light therapy and fluoxetine similarly effective for improving seasonal affective disorder.
AU  - Gaynes BN
T2  - Evidence Based Mental Health
AB  - What is the comparative efficacy and safety of light therapy and fluoxetine for seasonal affective disorder?METHODSDesign: Multicentre randomised controlled trial. Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Double blind.Follow up period: Eight weeks (treatment period only).Setting: Four mood disorder clinics in Canada; September to February from 2000 to 2003.Patients: Ninety six adult outpatients with a seasonal (winter onset) pattern of major depressive disorder (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) and a score of >/=23 on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) or >/=20 on the 17-item HDRS. Main exclusions: pregnancy or risk of pregnancy; lactation; high risk of suicide; organic mental disorders; serious medical or psychiatric comorbidity; retinal disease; previous light therapy or fluoxetine; formal psychotherapy (current or within the past 3 months); shift work or travelling south during the study.Intervention: 10 000-lux light treatment (applied for 30 minutes each morning) plus placebo capsule versus fluoxetine (20 mg/ day) plus placebo light treatment (100-lux).Outcomes: Depressive symptoms (24-item HDRS); clinical response (>/=50% reduction from baseline in HDRS score at the lost visit); clinical remission (clinical response plus on HDRS score < 8 at the last visit); treatment emergent adverse events (an event that increased in participant rated severity to moderate or severe using the unpublished Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments Adverse Events Scale).Patient follow up: 84% completed treatment, and 100% included in last observation carried forward analyses.MAIN RESULTSThere was no significant difference in the reduction in depressive symptoms between light treatment and fluoxetine over eight weeks' treatment (change in mean HDRS score: 30.2 at baseline to 11.6 at 8 weeks with light treatment v 29.6 at baseline to 11.6 at 8 weeks with fluoxetine; difference reported as not significant). There were no significant differences between treatments in clinical response or remission (response: 67% with both treatments, p = 1.0; remission: 50% with light treatment v 54% with fluoxetine; p = 0.84). Fluoxetine significantly increased treatment emergent agitation (12.5% with fluoxetine v 0% with light treatment; p<0.05), sleep disturbance (29.2% with fluoxetine v 2.1% with light treatment; p<0.01) and palpitations (10.4% with fluoxetine v 0% with light treatment; p<0.05).CONCLUSIONSLight therapy and fluoxetine produced greater improvements in seasonal affective disorder symptoms. Light treatment was associated with fewer adverse effects compared with fluoxetine.NOTESThe RCT had 80% power to detect a difference of 3.6 points or more in the mean change in Hamilton depression scale scores.

AB  - Background: Low parental tolerance for crying has been associated with infant sleep problems, yet the directionality of this link remained unclear. This longitudinal study aimed to assess the synchronous and prospective bidirectional links between parental cry-tolerance, soothing, and infant sleep from pregnancy through six months postpartum.Methods: Sixty-five couples were recruited during pregnancy and assessed for cry-tolerance using a paradigm in which participants were shown a videotape of a crying infant and were asked to stop the video when they feel it is necessary to intervene. Infant sleep was assessed objectively using actigraphy for five nights at three and six months postpartum. Parental soothing techniques were reported by parents at both assessment points, and cry-tolerance was reassessed at six months.Results: Concomitant associations were found between maternal cry-tolerance and infant sleep at six months, indicating that lower maternal cry-tolerance was correlated with poorer actigraphic sleep quality. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modeling analyses yielded significant prospective associations, showing that lower cry-tolerance at pregnancy predicted better infant sleep at three months, whereas more disrupted sleep at three months predicted lower cry-tolerance at six months. Moreover, fathers showed higher cry-tolerance compared to mothers, and parents became more similar to each other across time in their reactivity to infant crying.Conclusion: Consistent with the transactional model of infant sleep, the findings of this study highlight the role of parental cry-tolerance in infant sleep development, and demonstrate bidirectional links between this construct and infant sleep throughout the first six months of life.

AU  - Lindqvist R
AU  - Åberg H
T2  - Scandinavian Journal of Public Health
AB  - AIMS: This study was carried out to investigate how the locus of control (LOC) varies between those who stop smoking in connection with pregnancy and those who do not. The LOC reflects the extent to which a person is in control of her or his life events. METHODS: One hundred and two women who were regular smokers at the time of conception and paid their first visits to the antenatal clinic (ANC) on account of the current pregnancy participated. The study was quantitative and questionnaire based, covering background factors, smoking habits, and the LOC. One hundred of the women were met a second time after the delivery. Smoking habits were monitored by the content of carbon monoxide in expired air. The LOC was recorded on a VAS scale (0-10). A lower index was consistent with a more internal LOC and a higher with a more external LOC. RESULTS: The median LOC found was 4.0 (range 1.1-7.9). The LOC was not correlated to the CO in expired air. Younger age was linked to a more internal LOC, while worse sleep was correlated to a more external LOC (p<0.05). No differences were found between those who stopped smoking and those who did not. This was the case in both light and heavy smokers. CONCLUSION: The LOC does not seem to influence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: For many women, pregnancy-related sleep disturbances and pregnancy-related anxiety change as pregnancy progresses and both are associated with lower maternal quality of life and less favorable birth outcomes. Thus, the interplay between these two problems across pregnancy is of interest. In addition, psychological resilience may explain individual differences in this association, as it may promote coping with both sleep disturbances and anxiety, and thereby reduce their mutual effects. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether sleep quality and sleep duration, and changes in sleep are associated with the level of and changes in anxiety during pregnancy. Furthermore, the study tested the moderating effect of resilience on these associations.Methods: At gestational weeks 14, 24, and 34, 532 pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland filled out questionnaires on general sleep quality, sleep duration and pregnancy-related anxiety; resilience was assessed in week 14.Results: Parallel process latent growth curve models showed that shorter initial sleep duration predicted a higher initial level of anxiety, and a higher initial anxiety level predicted a faster shortening of sleep duration. Changes in sleep duration and changes in anxiety over the course of pregnancy were not related. The predicted moderating effect of resilience was not found.Conclusions: The results suggested that pregnant women reporting anxiety problems should also be screened for sleeping problems, and vice versa, because women who experienced one of these pregnancy-related problems were also at risk of experiencing or developing the other problem.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe perceived levels of fatigue and energy before, during, and after pregnancy in a group of healthy women experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies; and to examine relationships between their perception of fatigue and energy, parity, and physiologic indicators of sleep disturbances, thyroid function, and iron deficiency. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 24 primiparous and 1 8 multiparous women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in fatigue and energy over time. Measures were obtained at follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle before pregnancy, at each trimester, and at 1 and 3 months after delivery. RESULTS: Younger age and lower prepregnancy levels of iron, ferritin, and hemoglobin explained 1st trimester fatigue. Less total sleep was related to fatigue in the 3rd trimester. Postpartum fatigue was related to reduced amounts of sleep and low levels of ferritin and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of premenstrual (luteal) fatigue, progesterone levels were unrelated to fatigue. Neither paid employment nor family variables influenced perception of fatigue. Nurses working with childbearing populations should counsel women about significant 1st trimester fatigue so they can prepare their work and home environments in an attempt to achieve adequate rest.

AB  - PurposeThis study was to clarify the characteristics and changes of the sleep-wake rhythm in mothers from late pregnancy to four months postpartum.MethodsParticipants were 57 women in late pregnancy to four months postpartum. The subjects were 57 mothers after 35 weeks of pregnancy who gave informed consent to participate. Of these, forty-seven mothers 1 month postpartum and thirty-four at 4 months postpartum, were surveyed longitudinally at.Participant recorded 24 hours sleep-and-wakefulness using a day-by-day plot method on Sleep Log at intervals of 30 minutes for one week.We calculated sleep parameters: total sleep time (TST), nocturnal sleep time (NST), diurnal sleep time (DST), longest sustained sleep period (LSP), LSP onset and offset times, numbers of total sleep hours and diurnal sleep hours, time of waking after sleep onset (WASO), number of WASO and sleep-wake cycle.ResultsTST were 7.79 hours in late pregnancy, 6.73 hours 1 month postpartum and 6.91 hours in 4 month after delivery (F=18.21, p<0.001). NST were 6.75 hours, 5.85 hours and 6.36 hours (F=12.27, p<0.001) respectively. LSP were 6.39 hours, 3.46 hours and 4.13 hours (F=87.61, p<0.001). TST, NST and LSP in postpartum were shorter than those late pregnancy. WASO were 0.42 hours, 1.70 hours and 1.14 hours (F=45.42, p<0.001). Number of WASO were 0.3 times, 1.7 times and 1.5 times (F=78.60, p<0.001). WASO in postpartum was longer than those late pregnancy, and number of WASO in postpartum was larger than those late pregnancy.It was found that LSP showed significant negative correlation with LSP onset in late pregnancy (r=-0.481, p<0.001), and 4 months postpartum (r=-0.396, p<0.05).In addition, LSP were predominantly between 0:22 and 6:50, while cycle of sleep-and-wakefulness rhythm was approximately 24 hours, which showed a range of 24.04 hours to 24.08 in the mothers in this study. ConclusionThe sleep-wakefulness rhythm in mothers is disturbed from late pregnancy to postpartum, although TSP, NSP, LSP decrease and WASO increases. The mothers who go to bed early are able to sleep longer during nighttime hours and sleep-and-wakefulness was approximately 24 hours cycle in all mothers.

AB  - Aim: Gather 'proof-of-concept' evidence of the adverse developmental potential of cotinine (a seemingly benign biomarker of recent nicotine/tobacco smoke exposure).Methods: Pregnant C57 mice drank nicotine- or cotinine-laced water for 6 wks from conception (NPRE = 2% saccharin + 100 μg nicotine/mL; CPRE = 2% saccharin + 10 μg cotinine/mL) or 3 wks after birth (CPOST = 2% saccharin + 30 μg cotinine/mL). Controls drank 2% saccharin (CTRL). At 17 ± 1 weeks (male pups; CTRL n = 6; CPOST n = 6; CPRE n = 8; NPRE n = 9), we assessed (i) cardiovascular control during sleep; (ii) arterial reactivity ex vivo; and (iii) expression of genes involved in arterial constriction/dilation.Results: Blood cotinine levels recapitulated those of passive smoker mothers' infants. Pups exposed to cotinine exhibited (i) mild bradycardia - hypotension at rest (p < 0.001); (ii) attenuated (CPRE , p < 0.0001) or reverse (CPOST ; p < 0.0001) BP stress reactivity; (iii) adrenergic hypocontractility (p < 0.0003), low protein kinase C (p < 0.001) and elevated adrenergic receptor mRNA (p < 0.05; all drug-treated arteries); and (iv) endothelial dysfunction (NPRE only).Conclusion: Cotinine has subtle, enduring developmental consequences. Some cardiovascular effects of nicotine can plausibly arise via conversion into cotinine. Low-level exposure to this metabolite may pose unrecognised perinatal risks. Adults must avoid inadvertently exposing a foetus or infant to cotinine as well as nicotine.

AU  - Nacir B
AU  - Karagöz A

T2  - Turkish Journal of Rheumatology
AB  - Pregnancy-related low back pain is a common problem during pregnancy. More than half of all pregnant women experience low back pain at some time during pregnancy. The pain can vary from a mild discomfort to being severe and disabling. In one-third of these women, pain is a severe problem compromising activities of daily living, work and sleep. The awareness of the possible impact of low back pain on the quality of life and the associated costs to society has increased medical attention over the last decade. Pain usually develops between the fifth and seventh month of pregnancy but may appear as early as the first trimester. Moreover, some women who experience back pain during pregnancy experience persistent back pain in the postpartum period or have an increased risk of back pain in subsequent pregnancies, and many women with chronic back pain link its onset to a pregnancy. Despite its high frequency, there are some ambiguities inherent in the terminology, diagnosis and classification. The etiology and pathogenesis are not yet clearly understood. The etiology of pain is probably related to a combination of mechanical, hormonal and vascular contributing factors. Low back pain in pregnancy is most commonly subdivided into lumbar pain and posterior pelvic pain. This subdivision is important in terms of both management and prognosis. Characteristic findings and treatment may differ between the two categories. Accurate assessment and effective treatment are important for managing the low back pain of pregnancy.

T2  - JOGNN: Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing
AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To evaluate the effect of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep quality, continuity, and quantity in a large cohort of pregnant women. Design Prospective, longitudinal study. Participants One hundred seventy (170) pregnant women at 10-20 weeks gestation. Methods Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time, averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain. Results On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality ( M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income < $50,000/year was associated with poorer sleep quality (β = -.18, p < 0.05) and greater sleep fragmentation (β = -.18, p < 0.05) following covariate adjustment. Conclusions Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider.

AB  - Background: Lead is a pervasive neurotoxicant that has been associated with poorer cognitive, behavioral, and motor outcomes in children. The effects of lead on sensory function have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant sensory function, as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and grating visual acuity (VA).Methods: Lead was measured in maternal blood in mid- and late-pregnancy (mean gestational age = 15.5 and 39.0 weeks, respectively) and umbilical cord blood in a cohort of full-term infants in rural northeastern China. ABR latencies (peaks I, III, V) were measured in newborns during unsedated sleep (n = 315). The ABR central-to-peripheral (C-P) ratio was calculated as the ratio between the III-V and I-III interpeak intervals. VA was measured in 6-week-olds using Teller Acuity Cards (n = 1019) and assigned as the narrowest grid the infant fixated on. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between tertiles of mid-pregnancy, late-pregnancy, or cord lead and newborn ABR or 6-week VA.Results: Higher late-pregnancy lead levels were associated with higher ABR C-P ratios and lower VA. In covariate-adjusted analyses, mean C-P ratios were 4.6 and 3.2 % higher in infants whose mothers had lead > 3.8 μg/dL and lead = 2-3.8 μg/dL, respectively, than for infants whose mothers had lead < 2 μg/dL (p-trend =0.002). In adjusted analyses for VA, mean scores were 8.5 and 7.2 % lower for maternal lead > 3.8 μg/dL and lead = 2-3.8 μg/dL, respectively, compared to lead < 2 μg/dL (p-trend =0.009).Conclusion: Auditory and visual systems maturation appears delayed in infants with higher prenatal lead exposure during late-pregnancy, even at relatively low levels. Both systems start myelinating in late gestation and mature rapidly in infancy. Higher ABR C-P ratio and lower grating VA scores suggest effects of low-level lead exposure on sensory system myelination.

AB  - Unlabelled: Amplitude integrated electroencephalogaphy (aEEG) is becoming an important tool for the assessment of cerebral activity in preterm newborns. Describing the relationship between early aEEG patterns and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can improve our knowledge of neurological injury in the preterm newborn. The aim of this prospective study was to identify early changes in the aEEG in premature newborns that could be associated to severe neurological lesion/death. Preterm newborns with a birth weight ≤1,500 g and/or 32 weeks of gestation were included. aEEG monitoring was performed during the first 72 h of life. A qualitative analysis of the aEEG recordings was performed, based on continuity, sleep-wake cycles (SWCs), inferior lower margin amplitude (LMA), and bandwidth (BW). Key outcomes were severe IVH and/or death. Ninety-two subjects were included (mean gestational age 28 weeks). In 28.6 % of subjects with HIV III/IHP, a low-voltage pattern was observed. A statistically significant relationship was found between low-voltage tracings and death and neurological lesion/death. Absent SWCs during the first 72 h were also related to death.Conclusion: Early aEEG patterns can be predictive of neurological outcome in the preterm newborn. Low-voltage tracing and absence of SWCs are associated with severe neurological lesions/death.

AB  - Background: Previous research has established a number of risk factors that are associated with the onset of PTSD following childbirth. However, little is known about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms.Methods: This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum.Results: We found several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point - PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum - only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum.Limitations: Limitations of the study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia from PTSD symptoms.Conclusions: Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments.

AB  - Background: Results of case-control studies in the past 5 years suggest that the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has changed since the 1991 UK Back to Sleep campaign. The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to assess these potential changes. Methods: Population-based data from home visits have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69 explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993 and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen "reference" sleep before interview have been used for comparison. Findings: Over the past 20 years, the proportion of children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone-rather than because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer are breastfed. Interpretation: Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families, and particularly, infant sleep environments.

T2  - Australian Family Physician
AB  - Background Average annual fertility rates in industrialised countries have been below two children per woman for the past 3 decades. The reasons behind women's childbearing behaviour are complex. However, a lack of awareness regarding the consequences of delayed childbearing and the inability of reproductive technologies to overcome the 'biological clock' may be contributory factors. Objective A narrative review guided by the research question: What do women need to know about the consequences of delayed childbearing in order to make informed decisions about their fertility? Discussion There are three facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around their fertility: Some women want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone childbearing; there can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing and; some women's ideas about their fertility don't match the 'the scientific facts'. General practitioners are well placed to play a strategic role in the provision of timely, relevant information to help women make informed decisions about their fertility. Further research is needed to identify the most appropriate ways for GPs to communicate this information.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent hypoxia and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown whether intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA modifies male fertility. We tested the hypothesis that male fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA in a mouse model. DESIGN: Case-control comparison in a murine model. SETTING: University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen F1 (C57BL/6xCBA) male mice. INTERVENTIONS: Mice were subjected to a pattern of periodic hypoxia (20 sec at 5% O2 followed by 40 sec of room air) 6 h/day for 60 days or normoxia. After this period, mice performed a mating trial to determine effective fertility by assessing the number of pregnant females and fetuses. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: After euthanasia, oxidative stress in testes was assessed by measuring the expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sperm motility was determined by Integrated Semen Analysis System (ISAS). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased testicular oxidative stress, showing a reduction in the expression of Gpx1 and Sod1 by 38.9% and 34.4%, respectively, as compared with normoxia (P < 0.05). Progressive sperm motility was significantly reduced from 27.0 ± 6.4% in normoxia to 12.8 ± 1.8% in the intermittent hypoxia group (P = 0.04). The proportion of pregnant females and number of fetuses per mating was significantly lower in the intermittent hypoxia group (0.33 ± 0.10 and 2.45 ± 0.73, respectively) than in normoxic controls (0.72 ± 0.16 and 5.80 ± 1.24, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the intermittent hypoxia associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could induce fertility reduction in male patients with this sleep breathing disorder.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate prospectively the association between male sleep duration and fecundability.Design: Pregnancy Online Study (PRESTO), a Web-based prospective cohort study of North American couples enrolled during the preconception period (2013-2017).Setting: Not applicable.Patient(s): Male participants were aged ≥21 years; female participants were aged 21-45 years.Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): At enrollment, men reported their average nightly sleep duration in the previous month. Pregnancy status was updated on female follow-up questionnaires every 8 weeks for up to 12 months or until conception. Analyses were restricted to 1,176 couples who had been attempting to conceive for up to six cycles at enrollment. Proportional probabilities regression models were used to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders.Result(s): Relative to 8 hours per night of sleep, multivariable-adjusted FRs for <6, 6, 7, and ≥9 hours per night of sleep were 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.87), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87-1.30), 0.97 (95% CI 0.81-1.17), and 0.73 (95% CI 0.46-1.15), respectively. The association between short sleep duration (<6 hours per night) and fecundability was similar among men not working nights or rotating shifts (FR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.88) and among men without a history of infertility (FR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.87) and was stronger among fathers (FR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76).Conclusion(s): Short sleep duration in men was associated with reduced fecundability. Because male factor accounts for 50% of couple infertility, identifying modifiable determinants of infertility could provide alternatives to expensive fertility workups and treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness. METHOD: An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated. RESULTS: The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

TI  - Management of obesity in pregnancy.
AU  - Catalano PM
T2  - Obstetrics & Gynecology
AB  - Maternal pregravid obesity is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes during pregnancy. In early pregnancy there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies. In later gestation maternal metabolic manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, such as gestational hypertensive disorders and diabetes, become clinically recognized because of the increased insulin resistance in obese compared with nonobese women. In women with pregestational glucose intolerance, hypertension, central obesity, and lipid disorders, the physiologic changes in pregnancy increase the risk of problems previously not routinely encountered during pregnancy. These include chronic cardiac dysfunction, proteinuria, sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. At parturition the obese patient is at an increased risk of cesarean delivery and associated complications of anesthesia, wound disruption, infection, and deep venous thrombophlebitis. For the fetus there are short-term risks of fetal macrosomia, more specifically obesity, and long-term risks of adolescent components of the metabolic syndrome. Although preliminary results of bariatric surgery are encouraging, the procedure is expensive and not for all obese women, and we recognize that long-term follow-up data on offspring of obese women who have undergone bariatric surgery before pregnancy are lacking. In the interim, we need to encourage obese women to lose weight before conception, using lifestyle changes if possible. During pregnancy, weight gain should be limited to Institute of Medicine guidelines (currently under review) and encouragement given for physical activity.

TI  - Mandibular distraction osteogenesis for pediatric airway management.
AU  - Miloro M
T2  - Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery (02782391)
AB  - PURPOSE: Mandibular retrognathia may cause upper airway obstruction in the pediatric patient due to tongue collapse and physical obstruction in the hypopharyngeal region. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis. RESULTS: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis. CONCLUSION: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of the disease process and may allow for future growth.

AB  - Background: Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk of affective psychoses following childbirth (i.e. "postpartum psychosis", PP) and there is a need to identify which factors underlie this increased risk. Vulnerability to mood dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is typified by sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes triggered by sleep loss was associated with PP in women with bipolar disorder (BD).Methods: Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on whether mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of PP were compared between women who did and did not report mood episodes following sleep loss.Results: Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.47-2.97, p < 0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p = 0.526).Limitations: Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes.Conclusions: In clinical practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.

AB  - Aim: To describe the prevalence of paediatric sleep disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms in extremely low gestational age infants and identify neonatal risk factors, including early exposure to hypoxia and hyperoxia.Methods: Patients <28 weeks gestation were monitored with high-resolution pulse oximetry. Hypoxia/hyperoxia variables were defined as percentage time of first 4 weeks of life that SaO(2) < 80% or SaO(2) > 98%, respectively. Parents completed part of the OSA-18 questionnaire for symptoms of SDB at 18-22 months. Logistic regression was used to test the association between risk factors and sleep symptoms.Results: Of 182 patients recruited, 138 (76%) completed the questionnaire. The mean gestation was 26 weeks, and mean birth weight 887 grams. Loud snoring (21%) and restless sleep (24%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of loud snoring (OR, 2.7; CI, 1.13-6.5). Prolonged mechanical ventilation, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged caffeine use, however, were inversely correlated with loud snoring. Neither neonatal hypoxia nor hyperoxia were associated with sleep symptoms.Conclusions: While the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing symptoms is similar to reported rates, we found a sex difference not previously reported. Interestingly, markers for severity of illness show a pattern of being protective against loud snoring.

AB  - Objective: The quality and duration of sleep is impaired during pregnancy. Our study aimed to determine whether maternal sleep deprivation occurring during the second and third trimester of pregnancy could alter fetal well-being with respect to birth weight and APGAR score by altering the inflammatory status and oxidative stress in the mothers. Method: Sleep adequacy was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We investigated the inflammatory status and oxidative stress at term in the blood of pregnant subjects with and without sleep deprivation by measuring the levels of protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO). Homocysteine (Hcy) and its vitamin determinants were also measured. Fetal outcome with respect to birth weight and APGAR score were compared between study subjects. Results: A significant increase was observed in the levels of hsCRP, PBSA, Hcy, MDA, and PCO, in the sleep-deprived group when compared to the control group. Fetal outcome at birth showed a significant difference between the cases with high sleep deprivation and those with low sleep deprivation. Conclusion: Sleep deprivation in pregnancy leads to an increase in the inflammatory parameters, oxidative stress, and Hcy levels. Fetal outcome at birth was affected more in mothers with high sleep deprivation than those with low sleep deprivation. Follow-up in these babies are needed to reveal any differences in their growth and development.

AB  - Objective: To identify factors predictive of either lateral or prone infant sleep positioning.Study Design: We used data for 11340 mother-infant pairs from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for infants born in Washington State, 1996 to 2002. We used predictive modeling to identify statistically significant (P < .05) predictors of lateral and prone sleep positioning.Results: Factors associated with both high-risk sleep positions included infant's year of birth, maternal race and ethnicity, maternal county of residence, and maternal parity. Mother's being US-born (versus foreign-born) and male infant sex were predictive only of prone sleep positioning. Having Medicaid as primary insurance, receipt of government benefits, low infant gestational age, and low birth weight were predictive only of lateral sleep positioning.Conclusions: Factors predictive of either high-risk sleep position should be considered when devising public health intervention strategies for the prevention of SIDS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to estimate the maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Women delivering between 2000-2008 with confirmed OSA in an academic center were included. Normal-weight and obese controls were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio. Maternal and neonatal morbidities were compared between the groups. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate maternal morbidity and preterm birth (PTB). RESULTS: The analysis included 57 pregnancies complicated by OSA. Compared with normal-weight (n = 114) controls, OSA patients had more preeclampsia (PET) (19.3% vs 7.0%; P = .02) and PTB (29.8% vs 12.3%; P = .007). Controlling for comorbid conditions, OSA was associated with an increased risk of PTB (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-6.6), mostly secondary to PET (63%). Cesarean delivery (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.9-22.1) and OSA were associated with maternal morbidity (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-13.7). CONCLUSION: Pregnancies complicated by OSA are at increased risk for preeclampsia, medical complications, and indicated PTB.

AB  - Objective: Public Health initiatives, such as the “Safe to Sleep” campaign, have traditionally targeted infants’ risk factors for the prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, controversy remains regarding maternal and obstetrical risk factors for SIDS. In our study, we sought out to determine both modifiable and non-modifiable obstetrical and maternal risk factors associated with SIDS. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the CDC’s Linked Birth–Infant Death data from the United States for the year 2010. The impact of several obstetrical and maternal risk factors on the risk of overall infant mortality and SIDS was estimated using unconditional regression analysis, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results: Our cohort consisted of 4,007,105 deliveries and 24,174 infant deaths during the first year of life, of which 1991 (8.2%) were due to SIDS. Prominent risk factors for SIDS included (OR [95% CI]): black race, 1.89 [1.68–2.13]; maternal smoking, 3.56 [3.18–3.99]; maternal chronic hypertension, 1.73 [1.21–2.48]; gestational hypertension, 1.51 [1.23–1.87]; premature birth <37 weeks, 2.16 [1.82–2.55]; IUGR, 2.46 [2.14–2.82]; and being a twin, 1.81 [1.43–2.29],p < 0.0001. Relative to a cohort of infants who died of other causes, risk factors with a predilection for SIDS were maternal smoking, 2.48 [2.16–2.83] and being a twin, 1.52 [1.21–1.91],p < 0.0001. Conclusions for practice: While certain socio-demographic and gestational characteristics are important risk factors, maternal smoking remains the strongest prenatal modifiable risk factor for SIDS. We recommend the continuation of Public Health initiatives that promote safe infant sleeping practices and smoking cessation during and after pregnancy.

AB  - Study Objectives: Maternal and paternal sleep insufficiency during pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for health and wellbeing in young families. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress.Methods: The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night.Results: We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8% vs. 6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5% vs. 9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6-5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8-5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men.Conclusions: The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.

AB  - Background Maternal depression has been associated with excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems, but the specificity of maternal depression, as compared with maternal anxiety remains unclear and manifest disorders prior to pregnancy have been widely neglected. In this prospective longitudinal study, the specific associations of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to, during and after pregnancy and infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems were investigated in the context of maternal parity. Methods In the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n = 306 primiparous and multiparous women were repeatedly interviewed from early pregnancy until 16 months post partum with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V) to assess DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders. Information on excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems was obtained from n = 286 mothers during postpartum period via questionnaire and interview (Baby-DIPS). Results Findings from this study revealed syndrome-specific risk constellations for maternal anxiety and depressive disorders as early as prior to pregnancy: Excessive infant crying (10.1%) was specifically associated with maternal anxiety disorders, especially in infants of younger and lower educated first-time mothers. Feeding problems (36.4%) were predicted by maternal anxiety (and comorbid depressive) disorders in primiparous mothers and infants with lower birth weight. Infant sleeping problems (12.2%) were related to maternal depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders irrespective of maternal parity. Conclusions Primiparous mothers with anxiety disorders may be more prone to anxious misinterpretations of crying and feeding situations leading to an escalation of mother-infant interactions. The relation between maternal depressive and infant sleeping problems may be better explained by a transmission of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy or a lack of daily structure and bedtime routine with the infant. Maternal disorders prior to pregnancy require more attention in research and clinical practice.

TI  - Maternal Breastfeeding Experiences and Neonatal Breastfeeding Behaviors of Children Later Diagnosed with Autism.
AU  - Lucas, Ruth F
AB  - The two studies presented here describe neonatal breastfeeding as a measure of neonatal processing. The first paper describes the theoretical framework which guides both studies, the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing. The first paper also reviews the state of the science for the measurement of neonatal processing, neonatal neurobehavioral organization (NNBO). The second paper is the first study to describe breastfeeding behaviors, a measure of NNBO, of children later diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).The first study describes the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing theoretical framework, reviews the science of NNBO biobehavioral measures, and provides a short summary of a descriptive study using breastfeeding as an NNBO measure. The Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing uses three concepts, a neonate, the environment (maternal factors) and the neonatal mental system. Neonatal processing occurs within the neonatal mental system. The mental system may be assessed by NNBO biobehaviors, specifically breastfeeding. Breastfeeding and other NNBO biobehavioral measures of sleep/wake states, vagal tone and heart rate variability, neurophysiological measures of eventrelated potential of brain activity, and nutritive sucking and sucking patterns of bottle feeding literature is reviewed. NNBO biobehavioral measures have been found to be predictive of developmental outcomes. Breastfeeding, however, as an NNBO biobehavioral measure, has limited research as a predictive measure for cognitive and social outcomes. A short summary describes maternal breastfeeding experiences of mothers of children later diagnosed with ASD using the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing as a guide. Mothers described their breastfeeding experiences and their neonate's breastfeeding behaviors. Many of the neonates' breastfeeding behaviors were described as demonstrating an atypical breastfeeding pattern, 'insatiable feeding', which may reflect early alteration in processing.The second paper applies the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing in a retrospective study. The study describes the maternal breastfeeding experiences during the first month after delivery of mothers who breastfed children later diagnosed with ASD. Mothers were interviewed in their homes, offices, libraries, at local shopping malls and restaurants. The interview used three measures created from the three major concepts within the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing: a maternal socio-environmental questionnaire, a semi-structured interview, and a post-interview summary.Participants were a convenience sample of 20 mothers (13 primiparas, 7 multiparas). Maternal age range was 28--60 years of age (M = 43.3, SD = 9.6). Two mothers had more than one son diagnosed with ASD. One mother had two sons and the second mother had three sons diagnosed with ASD for a total sample of 23 breastfed neonates. All 23 children had been full term neonates (38--42 weeks gestation) with birth weight > 2500 grams, diagnosed with ASD between ages of 18 months to 11 years of age (M = 4.3, SD = 2.4) and age range at the time of the maternal interview was 5--35 years of age (M = 11.5, SD = 7.6).Mothers described three types of breastfeeding experiences affected by the maternal environmental factor of professional support. One mother's experience overlapped between the first and second group. The first group (n=4) recalled breastfeeding success with no or limited professional support. The second group (n = 11) breastfed successfully after receiving positive professional support (one mother overlapped with group one), and the third group (n = 6) had variable success with breastfeeding after receiving unfavorable professional support. Support provided to the second and third groups was given for inexperience, anatomical barriers and neonates that demonstrated an 'insatiable feeding', i.e., frequent vigorous feeding without ceasing after satiation.The mothers of neonates later diagnosed with ASD described having similar breastfeeding experiences and challenges compared to the typically developing population. The mothers of neonates also described a triad of neonatal breastfeeding behaviors that merit future research, 'insatiable feeding', a vigorous suck that did not stop with satiation, diminished social interaction, and > 70th percentile for weight for many of the infants during the first year.Taken together, these findings support using the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing to guide future studies using NNBO biobehavioral measures. The findings also support future research to quantify the breastfeeding behavior of 'insatiable feeding' for a potential screening tool for neonates at-risk for ASD.

T2  - Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age. METHODS: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (≥300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%- 16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming ≥300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.17) but at a nonsignificant level. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months.

AB  - Little is known about factors associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Of 60 435 pregnant women in a population-based cohort, 3480 (5.8%) reported having migraine during the first 5 months of pregnancy. Of these, 2525 (72.6%) reported using migraine pharmacotherapy, mostly non-narcotic analgesics (54.1%) and triptans (25.4%). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.

AB  - Background: Low maternal choline intake and blood concentration may be risk factors for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD); however, the data are inconsistent. This is an important question to resolve because choline, if taken periconceptionally, might add to the protective effect currently being achieved by folic acid. Objective: We examined the relation between NTDs, choline status, and genetic polymorphisms reported to influence de novo choline synthesis to investigate claims that taking choline periconceptionally could reduce NTD rates. Design: Two study groups of pregnant women were investigated: women who had a current NTD-affected pregnancy (AP; n = 71) and unaffected controls (n = 214) and women who had an NTD in another pregnancy but not in the current pregnancy [nonaffected pregnancy (NAP); n = 98] and unaffected controls (n = 386). Blood samples to measure betaine and total choline concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms related to choline metabolism were collected at their first prenatal visit. Results: Mean (±SD) plasma total choline concentrations in the AP (2.8 ± 1.0 mmol/L) and control (2.9 ± 0.9 mmol/L) groups did not differ significantly. Betaine concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Total choline and betaine in the NAP group did not differ from controls. Cases were significantly more likely to have the G allele of phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT; V175M, +5465 G>A) rs7946 (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Our results indicate that maternal betaine and choline concentrations are not strongly associated with NTD risk. The association between PEMT rs7946 and NTDs requires confirmation. The addition of choline to folic acid supplements may not further reduce NTD risk.

AB  - Background: Synchronizing eating schedules to daily circadian rhythms may improve metabolic health, but its association with gestational glycemia is unknown.Objective: This study examined the association of maternal night-fasting intervals and eating episodes with blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study within a prospective cohort in Singapore. Maternal 24-h dietary recalls, fasting glucose, and 2-h glucose concentrations were ascertained at 26-28 wk gestation for 1061 women (aged 30.7 ± 5.1 y). Night-fasting intervals were based on the longest fasting duration during the night (1900-0659). Eating episodes were defined as events that provided >50 kcal, with a time interval between eating episodes of ≥15 min. Multiple linear regressions with adjustment for confounders were conducted.Results: Mean ± SD night-fasting intervals and eating episodes per day were 9.9 ± 1.6 h and 4.2 ± 1.3 times/d, respectively; fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations were 4.4 ± 0.5 and 6.6 ± 1.5 mmol/L, respectively. In adjusted models, each hourly increase in night-fasting intervals was associated with a 0.03 mmol/L decrease in fasting glucose (95% CI: -0.06, -0.01 mmol/L), whereas each additional daily eating episode was associated with a 0.15 mmol/L increase in 2-h glucose (95% CI: 0.03, 0.28 mmol/L). Conversely, night-fasting intervals and daily eating episodes were not associated with 2-h and fasting glucose, respectively.Conclusions: Increased maternal night-fasting intervals and reduced eating episodes per day were associated with decreased fasting glucose and 2-h glucose, respectively, in the late-second trimester of pregnancy. This points to potential alternative strategies to improve glycemic control in pregnant women. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

AB  - Abstract: Objective: To identify biological and socioeconomic factors associated with the neurological development of Mexican infants born at term, as measured by brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs). Subjects and methods: We conducted a cohort study among 76 women with low risk pregnancies recruited in their third trimester of pregnancy and followed their infants until 12 months of age. BAEP tests were conducted on the infants before 3 months of age during physiologic sleep, using 100 msec bipolar clicks. Maternal dietary intake was evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. Two BAEP groups (short latency, long latency) were identified by cluster analysis. The association between BAEP group and maternal PUFAs was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic and biological factors. Results: Short latency BAEPs were associated with a maternal diet rich in arachidonic acid (OR=3.63, 95% CI 1.23–10.67) after adjusting for age (in days) sex, head circumference and gestational age but was not significantly associated to a maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Conclusions: Our results suggest the importance of arachidonic acid intake during pregnancy for short latency BAEPs and adequate fetal myelination.

AB  - Aims: To assess the implications of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on long-term respiratory related hospitalizations of the offspring.Methods: A population-based cohort analysis including singleton pregnancies delivered between the years 1991 to 2014 in a tertiary referral hospital was conducted. Incidence of hospitalizations (up to age 18 years) due to various respiratory diseases was compared between offspring of GDM-complicated pregnancies and normoglycemic pregnancies. Kaplan-Meyer curves were used to assess cumulative hospitalization incidence. Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for baseline selected confounders.Results: During the study period 216,197 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 4.7% (n = 10,184) were complicated by GDM. In most of the investigated respiratory diseases, no significant differences were found between offspring of both groups. Nonetheless, obstructive sleep apnea-related hospitalization rate was higher among the GDM group, an association which proved to be independent of potential confounders with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.26 (95% CI 1.02-1.55; p = 0.036).Conclusion: Gestational diabetes mellitus does not appear to be associated with long-term respiratory hospitalizations of the offspring other than obstructive sleep apnea-related hospitalizations.

AB  - Few studies have examined relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring beyond very early childhood. Eighty-five women classified as high risk for major depressive disorder during pregnancy completed measures of mood and their child's sleep 4-7 years postpartum. Mothers with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores ≥20 reported more sleep problems in their child, and child sleep disruption was a reasonable predictor of maternal BDI-II. More research is needed to determine causal relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring.

AB  - Background: Synchrony between daily feeding-fasting signals and circadian rhythms has been shown to improve metabolic health in animals and adult humans, but the potential programming effect on fetal growth is unknown.Objective: We examined the associations of the maternal night-fasting interval during pregnancy with offspring birth size and adiposity.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of mother-offspring dyads within the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort. For 384 mothers aged 30.8 ± 4.8 y (mean ± SD), the night-fasting interval at 26-28 wk of gestation was determined from a 3-d food diary based on the average of the fasting duration at night (1900-0659). Offspring birth weight, length, and head circumference were measured and converted to weight-for-gestational age (GA), length-for-GA, and head circumference-for-GA z scores, respectively, by using local customized percentile charts. The percentage of neonatal total body fat (TBF) was derived by using a validated prediction equation. Multivariable general linear models, stratified by child sex, were performed.Results: The mean ± SD maternal night-fasting interval was 9.9 ± 1.3 h. In infant girls, each 1-h increase in the maternal night-fasting interval was associated with a 0.22-SD (95% CI: 0.05-, 0.40-SD; P = 0.013) increase in birth head circumference-for-GA and a 0.84% (95% CI: 0.19%, 1.49%; P = 0.012) increase in TBF at birth, after adjustment for confounders. In infant boys, no associations were observed between the maternal night-fasting interval and birth size or TBF.Conclusions: An increased maternal night-fasting interval in the late second trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased birth head circumference and TBF in girls but not boys. Our findings are in accordance with previous observations that suggest that there are sex-specific responses in fetal brain growth and adiposity, and raise the possibility of the maternal night-fasting interval as an underlying influence. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

AB  - Aim: Several studies have examined the links between maternal obesity and the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in children, with inconsistent results. The aim of our study was to investigate whether maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of CP in offspring by using meta-analysis.Method: PubMed and Web of Science were searched until August 2017. Observational studies relevant to the maternal obesity and risk of CP in children were extracted and compiled. Meta-analyses were performed for different obesity levels and pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.Results: A total of five cohort studies involving 12 324 cases and 7 919 288 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled crude and adjusted ORs (95% CIs) were 1.65 (1.38-1.98) and 1.51 (1.24-1.84) respectively. Additionally, the pooled OR (95% CI) for CP in offspring in relation to maternal obesity class I (body mass index [BMI] 30.0-34.9), class II (BMI 35.0-39.9), and class III (BMI≥40.0) compared with normal weight during prepregnancy or pregnancy was 1.31 (1.15-1.50), 1.65 (1.34-2.02), and 2.37 (1.91-2.94) respectively.Interpretation: This meta-analysis demonstrated that increasing grades of maternal obesity are associated with a higher risk of CP in offspring.What This Paper Adds: Meta-analysis demonstrates a significant positive association between maternal obesity and the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in children. Subgroup analysis indicates that higher grades of maternal obesity are associated with increasing risk of CP.

AB  - Background: Maternal obesity increases offspring propensity to metabolic dysfunctions and to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. The circadian clock is a transcriptional/epigenetic molecular machinery synchronising physiological processes to coordinate energy utilisation within a 24-h light/dark period. Alterations in rhythmicity have profound effects on metabolic pathways, which we sought to investigate in offspring with programmed NAFLD.Methods: Mice were fed a standard or an obesogenic diet (OD), before and throughout pregnancy, and during lactation. Offspring were weaned onto standard or an OD at 3 weeks postpartum and housed in 12:12 light/dark conditions. Biochemical and histological indicators of NAFLD and fibrosis, analysis of canonical clock genes with methylation status and locomotor activity were investigated at 6 months.Results: We show that maternal obesity interacts with an obesogenic post-weaning diet to promote the development of NAFLD with disruption of canonical metabolic rhythmicity gene expression in the liver. We demonstrate hypermethylation of BMAL-1 (brain and muscle Arnt like-1) and Per2 promoter regions and altered 24-h rhythmicity of hepatic pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators.Conclusions: These data implicate disordered circadian rhythms in NAFLD and suggest that disruption of this system during critical developmental periods may be responsible for the onset of chronic liver disease in adulthood.

AU  - Della Vedova, A.M.
T2  - Journal of Reproductive & Infant Psychology
AB  - Objective:The study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child’s temperament at 3 months postpartum.Background:The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may increase the risk of the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence.Methods:A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament.Results:Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby.Conclusion:The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This is a prospective study of the effects of maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy on newborn neurobehavioral integrity, including systematic measures of behavioral state, sleep organization, motor activity, heart rate variability (HRV), tremulousness, and startles. METHODS: The sample included 17 SSRI-exposed and 17 nonexposed, full-birth-weight newborn infants who had no obvious medical problems and were matched on maternal cigarette use, social class, and maternal age. SSRI exposure was determined by medical records and maternal self-report during a standard interview. Behavioral state, startles, and tremulousness were evaluated for 1 hour between feedings. Automated recordings of motor activity and HRV were also assessed during a 15-minute subset sleep period. HRV was subjected to spectral analysis to detect rhythms in autonomic regulation. Exposed and nonexposed infant groups were compared on measures of neurobehavioral development both before and after adjustment for gestational age as a covariate. RESULTS: SSRI-exposed infants had a shorter mean gestational age; were more motorically active and tremulous; and showed fewer rhythms in HRV, fewer changes in behavioral state, fewer different behavioral states, and a lower peak behavioral state. SSRI-exposed infants also had significantly more rapid eye movement sleep, which was characterized by longer continuous bouts in that state and higher numbers of spontaneous startles or sudden arousals. After effects of gestational age were covaried, significant differences continued to be found in tremulousness and all measures of state and sleep organization, but effects on startles, motor activity, and rhythms in HRV were no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide the first systematic evidence that women who use SSRIs during pregnancy have healthy, full-birth-weight newborn infants who show disruptions in a wide range of neurobehavioral outcomes. Effects on motor activity, startles, and HRV may be mediated through the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age. Future research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of SSRI use during pregnancy and an improved public health outcome.

AB  - Objective: Sleep disorders are associated with cardiovascular complications and preterm delivery (PTD). Insufficient sleep results in metabolic alterations and increased inflammation, both known to contribute to placental abruption (abruption), a determinant of PTD. We examined associations of abruption with sleep duration and complaints of vital exhaustion.Methods: The study included 164 abruption cases and 160 controls in a multicenter study in Peru. Data on habitual sleep duration and vital exhaustion during the first 6 months of pregnancy were elicited during interviews conducted following delivery. Women were categorized according to short, normal and long sleep duration (≤6, 7-8 and ≥9 h); and frequency of feeling exhausted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.Results: Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased odds of abruption. The ORs of abruption in relation to short (≤6 h) and long (≥9 h) sleep duration were 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.7) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-4.1), compared with normal sleep duration (7-8 h). Complaints of vital exhaustion were also associated with abruption (OR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.46-3.85), and were independent of sleep duration.Conclusion: We extend the existing literature and support the thesis that maternal sleep habits and disorders should be assessed among pregnant women.

AB  - There is a wealth of evidence to say that sleep impacts maternal health during pregnancy, however, little has been published on fetal health and maternal sleep. This scoping review summarises current literature on maternal sleep including sleep disordered breathing, sleep quality, sleep duration and supine sleep position, as these relate to fetal outcomes specifically birth weight, growth, preterm birth and stillbirth. An overall interpretation of the studies evaluated shows that events occurring during maternal sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea, sleep disruption and sleep position may have a negative effect on the fetus resulting in altered growth, gestational length and even death. These effects are biologically and physically plausible. In conclusion, there is limited and often conflicting information on maternal sleep and fetal outcomes. However, existing evidence suggests that this is an important area for future research. This area is ripe for investigation if there is to be reduction in the physical, emotional, and financial burden of poor fetal outcomes related to maternal sleep.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are increased in pregnancy compared to the nongravid state. Maternal SDB may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this is still under investigation. We performed a systematic literature review, and where feasible, a metaanalysis, to evaluate whether women with SDB in pregnancy have a higher risk of specific adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with women without SDB. STUDY DESIGN: Original studies published until June 2012 evaluating the association between gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight infants, and maternal SDB, defined either by symptoms or the reference standard polysomnography, were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data were extracted on study design and outcome estimates. When appropriate, effect estimates from each study were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of the 4386 studies identified, 31 met the defined criteria. Twenty-one studies, all observational in design, reported dichotomous outcomes; 9 of these adjusted for potential confounders. Maternal SDB was significantly associated with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia (pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-3.09; 5 studies), and gestational diabetes (pooled aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; 5 studies). CONCLUSION: Based on published observational studies to date, maternal SDB is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes after adjusting for potential confounders. However, large-scale, prospective cohort, and interventional studies are needed to further elucidate the relationship between maternal SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AU  - Pamidi, Sushmita

T2  - CHEST
AB  - Emerging literature suggests that sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) worsens over the course of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Earlier studies, using mainly snoring as a surrogate marker for SDB, have shown an increase in the prevalence of SDB during pregnancy compared with that in the pregravid state. More recently, prospective observational studies in which the investigators ascertained SDB by using complete polysomnography have shown a prevalence ranging from approximately 17% to 45% in the third trimester. Pregnancy itself can be associated with daytime hypersomnolence, so complaints of increasing fatigue and sleepiness during pregnancy are not specific for SDB. Moreover, snoring in isolation also has relatively poor sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool for diagnosing maternal SDB. The indications for screening for SDB during routine obstetric prenatal visits are still unclear, but observational studies indicate that maternal SDB is linked with the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus. Some studies also have identified a relationship between maternal SDB and the delivery of infants who are small for gestational age. Aside from a few small interventional studies of CPAP in pregnant patients with gestational hypertension, little currently is known about whether treatment of SDB during pregnancy improves clinical outcomes for the mother and/or baby. Additional current knowledge gaps include elucidating underlying mechanisms of maternal SDB, determining optimal treatment strategies, and understanding the trajectory of SDB after delivery.

AB  - The current study explored the relationship between maternal subjective sleep quality and two factors that have been independently linked to maternal sleep: infant caretaking at night and maternal depressive symptom severity. Participants were a follow-up cohort of 94 women (mean age 33.3, SD=4.4), who were depressed during pregnancy and part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Participants were evaluated 10 weeks after delivery, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and daily sleep logs for one week. On average, women woke to attend to the infant 2.2 times (SD=1.1) and spent 47.3 min (SD=33.0) awake to attend to the infant. Regression analysis revealed that the number of times a woman's sleep was disrupted by attending to her infant was a significant predictor of her perceived subjective sleep quality; however, the total amount of time she spent attending to her infant and her depressive symptom severity were not predictors. The findings of this study suggest that during the third postpartum month, sleep fragmentation appears more detrimental to maternal subjective sleep quality than amount of time awake during the night. This finding is relevant to the implementation of clinical interventions for improving maternal subjective sleep quality during the early postpartum period.

TI  - Maternal transports: a content analysis of patient interviews compared with medical caregivers' patient assessments.
AU  - Schmidt JV
AB  - At a specialized care hospital transferred, pregnant, high risk patients were asked to describe their perceptions, concerns/fears, and needs. The contents of these interviews were analyzed and compared with medical caregivers' assessments of the transferred patient's experiences. This study was designed to further understand (1) the impact of transfer on the high risk pregnant patients and (2) the medical caregivers' observation of the impact. Twenty maternal transports were interviewed and audiotaped soon after the transport was completed in an open-interview format. A content analysis of the interviews identified the problems and events of the maternal transport experience during preparation, travel and arrival. Thirty one medical caregivers were asked similar questions which determined their cognizance of the patients perceptions and problems. The study results demonstrated patient concern for enroute delivery as well as for their fetal and pregnancy outcome. Patient focus away from the pregnancy and toward their abnormal bodily changes, physical discomforts, and medication side effects attested to the difficult adaptation of a complicated pregnancy. Support from family and friends was important but also more difficult when separated by distance. Patients described the nurse's helpfulness more often as giving information, support and guiding them through unfamiliar events than by providing physical care, while the nurses stated the opposite. Nurses were perceived as the person who helped the most. Arriving at the final specialized hospital destination was described as a relief and signaled increased confidence and increased hope for the pregnancy. It was discovered that sending hospitals positively prepared the patient for these feelings. Patient responses were aligned with Rubin's developmental stages of pregnancy but not with the usual changes observed in a high risk pregnancy. Coping responses of maternal transports included sensations of self-detachment and the use of diversion and sleep. Responses toward the transport experience included fear of the unknown, lack of understanding of both anticipated and current events, disbelief of the pregnancy events and concern for family separation. Caregivers underestimated the patient's level of concern and fear as well as her specific concerns for the unborn baby including enroute delivery.

AB  - Background: Naphthalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). It is easily emitted into the atmosphere, posing a significant risk to human health. However, limited studies have described the impact of naphthalene exposure on birth outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between the maternal urinary metabolites of naphthalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-OH NAP), and birth outcomes.Method: In the present study, four urinary PAH metabolites were measured in 263 pregnant women during late pregnancy. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the concentrations of 2-OH NAP and birth outcomes, and restricted cubic spline models were further used to examine the shapes of the dose-response association.Result: General linear models showed that prenatal urinary 2-OH NAP was associated with lower birth weight (BW) (- 4.38% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.049) and higher cephalization index (CI) (4.30% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.038). These associations were linear and significant when 2-OH NAP was modeled as a continuous variable in restricted cubic spline models (P linear = 0.0293 for 2-OH NAP and BW; P linear = 0.0326 for 2-OH NAP and CI). Multiple linear regression data indicated that each 1 ln-unit increase in 2-OH NAP was significantly associated with a 2.09 g/cm increase in the CI. The associations among 2-OH NAP, BW, and CI were also observed in a subset of participants residing close to arterial traffic.Conclusion: Our data indicated that prenatal exposure to naphthalene had an adverse effect on fetal birth outcomes, especially the brain development index. Reduced exposure to naphthalene may improve newborn health outcomes. In Taiyuan, naphthalene may result from traffic pollution.

AB  - Aim: To identify and describe infant deaths presenting suddenly and unexpectedly in whom there was a history of maternal methadone consumption or misuse of drugs during pregnancy.Methods: Retrospective review of neonatal postmortem examinations between 2004 and 2011.Results: A total of 138 autopsies were performed in infants up to 28 days. Thirty-two cases (23%) presented suddenly and unexpectedly. In 12 of 32 (37.5%), in whom the cause of death remained unexplained after a thorough postmortem, there was a history of methadone use and/or other drugs of abuse during pregnancy. Their mean age at death was 11 days (range 1-28 days). Multiple risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome were present in these 12 cases: smoking (10), prematurity (7), and inappropriate sleeping place (8). Five mothers were positive for hepatitis C. The history was inconsistent with the findings in only one case.Conclusion: An unexpectedly high proportion of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly in the first month had a history of maternal substance misuse. All had multiple risk factors, for sudden infant death syndrome many avoidable. We would stress the need to emphasise the 'Safe Sleep' message with these families at every contact with health professionals.

AB  - Few studies exist that identify a useful self-report measure of physical activity for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the self-report exercise diary with the pedometer and determine if self-report measurement provided useful physical activity measures during pregnancy. The pregnant women's sleep, parity, and related demographic factors were further analyzed for relationships to the physical activity measures. Physical activity was assessed in a sample of 94 pregnant midwestern U.S. women ages 18 to 38 years. The women wore a pedometer during all waking hours for 3 consecutive days at 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for a total of 6 days. During the same 6 days of monitoring, the women kept a diary account of the minutes they exercised per day. The pedometer and self-report exercise diary results correlated significantly (r = 49, p = .02). When examining for usefulness in measuring physical activity, a comparison of the women's occupational categories revealed no significant differences in self-reported minutes of exercise or pedometer counts per day.

AU  - Beijers, Roseriet
AU  - Buitelaar, Jan
AU  - Weerth, Carolina
T2  - European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
AB  - Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that maternal psychosocial stress and anxiety during pregnancy adversely affect child outcomes. However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental functioning, including the 11β-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines, compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the fetus.

AB  - Objective/background: The objective of this study was to evaluate medical comorbidity patterns in patients with a narcolepsy diagnosis in the United States.Patients/methods: This was a retrospective medical claims data analysis. Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Research Databases were accessed to identify individuals ≥18 years of age with ≥1 diagnosis code for narcolepsy (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 347.0, 347.00, 347.01, 347.1, 347.10, or 347.11) continuously insured between 2006 and 2010, and controls without narcolepsy matched 5:1 on age, gender, region, and payer. Narcolepsy and control subjects were compared for frequency of comorbid conditions, identified by the appearance of >1 diagnosis code(s) mapped to a Clinical Classification System (CCS) level 1 category any time during the study period, and on specific subcategories, including recognized narcolepsy comorbidities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and depression.Results: The final study group included 9312 subjects with narcolepsy and 46,559 controls (each group: average age, 46.1 years; 59% female). As compared with controls, patients with narcolepsy showed a statistically significant excess prevalence in all the CCS multilevel categories, the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7% excess prevalence; OR 3.7, 95% CI 3.4, 3.9).Conclusions: In this claims analysis, a narcolepsy diagnosis was associated with a wide range of comorbid medical illness claims, at significantly higher rates than matched controls.

AB  - Purpose: To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity.Method: We reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED in specific medical conditions.Results: Three broad study categories of medical comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome.Conclusions: BED is associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

AB  - Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

AB  - Background Uncontrolled studies in human have suggested that memantine might be a suitable option for migraine prophylaxis. Objective To assess the efficacy and tolerability of memantine for migraine prophylaxis. Methods This was a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Sixty patients with migraine without aura were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive memantine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline in the monthly attack frequency at week 12 between the two groups (using migraine diary). Secondary efficacy measures were assessed using several clinical, functional, and psychological instruments. We performed both complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat analyses (ITT). Results Twenty-five patients in the memantine group and 27 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Patients in the memantine group showed significantly greater reduction (mean change; 3.4; 95%CI, 2.3-4.4) in the monthly attack frequency than the placebo group (mean change, 1.0; 95%CI, 0.3-1.7) (mean difference [MD], 2.3; 95%CI, 1.1-3.5, P < .001). Both CC (MD, 4.9; 95%CI, 2.6-7.2 days), and ITT analyses (MD, 5.2; 95%CI, 2.0-8.5) showed significantly higher reduction in the mean number of migraine days in the memantine group than the placebo group ( P < .01). Patients in the memantine group experienced greater reduction in the number of work absence days, severity, and disability score than the patients in the placebo group in both ITT and CC analyses. Changes in quality of life, sleep, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups. Three patients in the memantine group complained of sedation, mild vertigo and nausea, and drowsiness. In the placebo group, one patient complained of nausea and another patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to vertigo. Conclusion Memantine might be a tolerable and efficacious option for prophylaxis in patients with migraine without aura. Tolerability, short duration required for titration, and safety profile in pregnancy might give memantine an advantage over other antimigraine medications. The study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (Registration number: IRCT2013120115616N1).

AB  - Background: Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) has persistent high rates in deprived indigenous communities and much of this mortality is attributable to unsafe sleep environments. Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Māori community in New Zealand has reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of this traditional sleeping device.Methods/design: This two arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from Māori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related) touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal sleep patterns.Discussion: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken worldwide.Trials Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000993099 Registered 16th November 2010.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and markers of microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes.Study Design: A total of 151 women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were recruited for repeat 24-h BP recordings thrice during pregnancy and once three months post partum. Fifty women without diabetes served as controls. The AASI and pulse pressure (PP) were computed from blood pressure recordings. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used for comparison between groups during and after pregnancy. Linear regression analysis was performed with AASI and PP as dependent variables and albuminuria and retinopathy as independent variables.Main Outcome Measures: AASI during diabetic pregnancy and association with microvascular disease.Results: Micro- or macroalbuminuria was present in 23% of the women and 58% had either simplex or proliferative retinopathy. The AASI was inversely associated with the coefficient of determination, which means that the stiffer vascular wall the more random variability in BP.Conclusion: AASI showed a strong association with microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes. Together with the flattened circadian rhythm this indicates a pregnancy-related functional change in the vascular bed.

T2  - Headache: The Journal of Head & Face Pain
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of menorrhagia and endometriosis in female migraineurs compared to age-matched women without headache. BACKGROUND: Migraine predominantly affects women of childbearing age and is often associated with the menstrual period, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of migraine and menstrual disorders. METHODS: Women diagnosed with migraine, using International Headache Society criteria and an age- and sex-matched control group, were administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding migraine and migraine-related disability, menstrual history, other bleeding history, vascular event history, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty female migraineurs between the ages of 22 and 50 years and 52 age-matched women (mean age 37 years) were enrolled in the study. Similar proportions of women in each group reported using hormone contraceptives (30% vs. 33%, P = .77) and hormone replacement therapy (12% vs. 8%, P = .69). The proportions presently menstruating (64% vs. 80%, P = .20) and status after hysterectomy were similar (24% vs. 14%, P = .84). Menorrhagia (defined as at least three consecutive heavy periods), both current and prior, was more commonly reported in migraineurs (63% vs. 37%, P = .009), with higher likelihood of staining clothes by menses (35% vs. 8%, P = .003), and significant impact of menses on activities of daily living (on a 10-point Likert scale) with work/school participation (P = .02), family activities (P < .0001), sleep (P = .003), life enjoyment (P = .001), mood (P = .02), and overall quality of life (P = .003). Endometriosis, which may be associated with menorrhagia, was also more commonly diagnosed in the migraineurs (30% vs. 4%, P = .001). The migraineurs more frequently described bruising (40% vs. 10%, P < .001) and rectal bleeding (18% vs. 2%, P = .017) but not more serious bleeding problems. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in the migraine group (28% vs. 12%, P = .036), and significance for increased menorrhagia, endometriosis, menstrual interference, and bruising was maintained, even when controlling for the use of NSAIDs. With logistic regression, menorrhagia was significantly associated with migraine, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.5), and with endometriosis, adjusted OR = 10.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 51.4). There were no differences in vascular events and risk factors, except for trends of increased hypertension (25% vs. 10%, P = .05), transient ischemic attack/stroke (10% vs. 2%, P = .08), and Raynaud's disease (10% vs. 2%, P = .08) in the migraineurs. CONCLUSION: Women with migraine have a higher frequency of menorrhagia, endometriosis, and associated psychosocial consequences. These findings suggest that there should be further study of factors influencing endometriosis and menstrual blood flow, such as eicosanoids and platelet function, in migraineurs.

TI  - Mild Depressive Symptoms During the Third Trimester of Pregnancy Are Associated with Disruptions in Daily Rhythms but Not Subjective Sleep Quality.
AU  - Simpson, William

AU  - Steiner, Meir
T2  - Journal of Women's Health (15409996)
AB  - Background: Recent research in major depressive disorder suggests that dysregulation of the circadian system may be a core pathophysiological component. In pregnancy, women often experience significant disruptions in their daily rhythms, including changes in day-to-day schedule and sleep habits. Current evidence suggests that these disruptions in daily rhythms may adversely affect underlying circadian rhythmicity. The purpose of our study was to examine whether subjectively rated daily rhythm disruptions were associated with a greater incidence of depressive symptoms during the third trimester. Method: Our study was a cross-sectional design, assessing sleep quality, symptoms of depression, and daily rhythm disruptions in 51 pregnant women in their third trimester. Results: We observed a significant relationship between mild depressive symptoms and disruptions in daily rhythms. While we initially observed a strong correlation between subjective sleep quality and depressive symptoms, this was attenuated after accounting for daily rhythm disruptions. Disruptions in daily social rhythms, eating patterns, and general activity were all significantly associated with depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Our findings point to a strong correlation between daily rhythm disruptions and prenatal depressive symptoms. Given that these daily rhythms are known to act as zeitgebers, longitudinal studies examining the directionality of this relationship between circadian rhythms and depressive symptoms during pregnancy are warranted.

TI  - Mild hypomania phenomenon in Japanese puerperal women.
AU  - Hasegawa M
T2  - Nursing & Health Sciences
AB  - After childbirth, women in other countries have been reported to have elation and associated features of hypomania within the first 5 days postpartum. However, there has been no research on this phenomenon in Japan. The characteristics of postpartum mild hypomania in Japanese mothers are discussed here. The usefulness of the Japanese version of 'The Highs' self-rating scale is evaluated and the prevalence of mild hypomania phenomenon for 5 days postpartum is measured. One hundred and nineteen pregnant women in Mie, Japan, agreed to participate in this research. The Japanese women reported feeling elated, especially on the first postpartum day. They also reported feeling the need for less sleep. Many women felt that they could reduce their sleep during hospitalization. There was a relationship between the primipara and the multipara in the obstetric factors selected for study and the occurrence of mild hypomania after delivery. There were not clear correlations in 'The Highs' scores for the nursing actions. It is suggested that the after-effect of stress would be highly correlated to elation, and there is some biological mechanism triggered especially on the first day postpartum.

AB  - Background: Clinically significant psychological distress in pregnancy is common, with epidemiological research suggesting that between 15 and 25 % of pregnant women experience elevated symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Untreated psychological distress in pregnancy is associated with poor obstetrical outcomes, changes in maternal physiology, elevated incidence of child physical and psychological disorders, and is predictive of maternal postpartum mood disorders. Despite the wide-ranging impact of antenatal psychological distress on mothers and their children, there is a gap in our knowledge about the most effective treatments that are available for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy. Additionally, no trials have focused on potential physiological changes that may occur as a result of receiving mindfulness training in pregnancy. The proposed trial will determine the effectiveness of an 8-week modified Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) intervention delivered during pregnancy.Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT to treat psychological distress in pregnancy. A sample of 60 consenting pregnant women aged 18 years and above will be enrolled and randomized to the experimental (MBCT) or control (treatment as usual) condition. Primary (e.g., symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety), secondary (cortisol, blood pressure (BP), heart rate variability (HRV), and sleep) and other outcome data (e.g., psychological diagnoses) will be collected via a combination of laboratory visits and at-home assessments from both groups at baseline (T1), immediately following the intervention (T2), and at 3 months postpartum (T3). Descriptive statistics will be used to describe sample characteristics. Data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Hierarchical linear models will be used to test intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes.Discussion: The trial is expected to improve knowledge about evidence-based treatments for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy and to evaluate the potential impact of mindfulness-based interventions on maternal physiology.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02214732 , registered on 7 August 2014.

TI  - Mindfulness-based yoga during pregnancy: a pilot study examining relationships between stress, anxiety, sleep, and pain.
AU  - Beddoe AE
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a 'mindful-yoga' intervention for healthy pregnant women that blended elements of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Iyengar style prenatal yoga, on stress, anxiety, sleep, and pain; to estimate statistical power and sample size for a larger study; and to establish whether the treatment is effective for second or third trimester women. The effects of variables on mindful-yoga were studied over time, comparing baseline (Time1) and post-intervention (Time2) data in a single treatment group of 19 English-speaking nulliparous women with healthy pregnancies, 17 of whom adhered to the intervention that met for seven weekly sessions.Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, correlations, parametric and nonparametric paired comparisons, and effect sizes. Participants were well-educated, middleclass, and planning vaginal birth. Although no one was currently being treated for psychiatric disorders, nearly 30% had a history of depression or anxiety.The intervention resulted in higher scores for two facets of mindfulness (Observing and Nonreacting). From Time1 to Time2, third trimester participants demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress and trait anxiety. Second trimester women demonstrated improvements in pain and sleep. In contrast, the third trimester group experienced worse pain and sleep as pregnancy progressed. To control for gestation, Time1 data for the 8 women who began mindful-yoga in the third trimester (26.5 weeks +/-2.3) were compared with Time2 data for the 9 women who began mindful-yoga in the second trimester (27.1 weeks +/-4.1). Second trimester women at Time2 experienced improved sleep (fewer night awakenings and less wake time during the night) as measured by wrist actigraphy compared to third trimester group baseline data.This study demonstrated important clinical improvements in sleep and pain for women who began mindful-yoga in their second trimester. Mindful-yoga intervention merits further research for reducing perceived stress and anxiety and second trimester sleep enhancement and pain reduction. The mechanisms of mindful-yoga on stress appraisal, anxiety, sleep, and pain were not clearly linked to mindfulness, and further studies are required to develop theoretical linkages between mindful-yoga and symptom reduction during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Cosmic radiation and circadian disruption are potential reproductive hazards for flight attendants.Methods: Flight attendants from 3 US airlines in 3 cities were interviewed for pregnancy histories and lifestyle, medical, and occupational covariates. We assessed cosmic radiation and circadian disruption from company records of 2 million individual flights. Using Cox regression models, we compared respondents (1) by levels of flight exposures and (2) to teachers from the same cities, to evaluate whether these exposures were associated with miscarriage.Results: Of 2654 women interviewed (2273 flight attendants and 381 teachers), 958 pregnancies among 764 women met study criteria. A hypothetical pregnant flight attendant with median first-trimester exposures flew 130 hours in 53 flight segments, crossed 34 time zones, and flew 15 hours during her home-base sleep hours (10 pm-8 am), incurring 0.13 mGy absorbed dose (0.36 mSv effective dose) of cosmic radiation. About 2% of flight attendant pregnancies were likely exposed to a solar particle event, but doses varied widely. Analyses suggested that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of miscarriage in weeks 9-13 (odds ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.95-3.2]). Risk of a first-trimester miscarriage with 15 hours or more of flying during home-base sleep hours was increased (1.5 [1.1-2.2]), as was risk with high physical job demands (2.5 [1.5-4.2]). Miscarriage risk was not increased among flight attendants compared with teachers.Conclusions: Miscarriage was associated with flight attendant work during sleep hours and high physical job demands and may be associated with cosmic radiation exposure.

AB  - Background: Postnatal depression affects the well-being of women and families. While several studies have shown an association between mode of birth and symptoms of postnatal depression, others have found no relationship. Aims: To determine whether women who have instrumental or caesarean births report higher levels of poor coping, sleep or appetite disturbance, or relationship difficulties, than women who have vaginal births, at the time of Universal Postnatal Contact (7-10 days post-discharge). Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort study of term, singleton births from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2013 at a tertiary obstetric facility. Outcomes were compared for 1816 women having vaginal births versus 1205 women having instrumental or caesarean births. Results: When adjusted for confounders, no association could be demonstrated between mode of birth and reporting of any postnatal symptom of psychological morbidity. However, the model did demonstrate an association between reporting of symptoms and nulliparity (aOR 1.69 (1.08-2.63); P = 0.02), as well as having an unplanned pregnancy with a supportive partner (aOR 0.54 (0.29-0.97); P = 0.04). Conclusions: Mode of birth does not appear to be associated with the reporting of symptoms of psychological morbidity in the early postnatal period. However, these symptoms may be associated with nulliparity and in the context of an unplanned pregnancy, a lack of partner support. These findings highlight the ongoing need for antenatal screening with respect to pregnancy intention and the presence of a social support system, to facilitate the implementation of interventions for women at risk of postnatal depression.

TI  - Mode of Delivery and Maternal and Infant Risk Factors and Health Outcomes.
AU  - Aaronson, Amanda Claire Burke
AB  - Childbirth is a necessary stressor. It prepares the infant for extrauterine life, and prepares the mother for lactation and safe return to the non-pregnant state. However, added stressors can have repercussions. This study aims to describe added stressors (including prenatal maternal socio-demographic and psychological factors) affecting mode of delivery (MOD), and the effect of MOD on mother-infant health at one month postpartum.Approximately 150 first-time, English-speaking, expectant mothers, at least 18 years of age, recruited from San Francisco, California prenatal clinics, participated in a postpartum intervention sleep study. Women were excluded if they had a sleep or mood disorder, or worked nights. This is a secondary analysis of these data.Prenatal maternal socio-demographic and risk factors (depression, anxiety, attitudes/adjustment, perceived stress) were evaluated by MOD outcome using analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-tests, Mann Whitney U, and Kruskall-Wallis. Labor induction/augmentation was evaluated by maternal report of non-reassuring fetal status (NRFS) with NRFS as the key outcome, analyzed by Chi-Square and logistic regression. Lastly, MOD was evaluated for effect on maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety, infant temperament rating, infant sleep, and breastfeeding continuation at one month using ANOVA and Chi-Square statistics.Prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms were not associated with MOD (normal vaginal, instrument vaginal, cesarean in labor, or scheduled cesarean). Mothers with a prenatal 'attitude toward baby' score that was more positive were more likely to have an unplanned cesarean birth. A scheduled cesarean birth was more likely in older women and those with higher pre-pregnancy BMI. Maternal reports of NRFS were associated with induction/augmentation. One month postpartum measures of maternal symptoms, maternal adjustment, infant temperament, and breastfeeding did not differ by MOD. However, according to maternal diary entries, cesarean-born infants slept an average of one hour more during the day than infants born vaginally.These findings provide preliminary indication that prenatal attitude toward baby plays a role in MOD, induction/augmentation is associated with increased NRFS, and cesarean birth is associated with increased infant sleep at one month. Nurses should develop and test interventions to minimize prenatal and labor factors that unnecessarily add to delivery stress.

AB  - Purpose This survey investigated late pregnancy maternal sleep practices and ability to modify sleep position in order to generate information on which to base future public health messages about optimal going-to-sleep position. Research Question What are the sleep practices of women in late pregnancy, and what are their views about changing going-to-sleep position if this was recommended? Significance Maternal sleep position in late pregnancy is a modifiable risk factor for late stillbirth. A 2011 study from Auckland, New Zealand, was the first to demonstrate a 2-fold increased risk for women who did not go to sleep on their left side the night before the fetus was thought to have died, with the highest risk for women who settled to sleep supine. This association has since been confirmed by an Australian and Ghanaian study and a New Zealand multicentre study. Methods A random sample of ethnically-representative women (N = 377), between 28 and 42 weeks' gestation, were surveyed in 2014 in South Auckland, New Zealand, a multicultural and socioeconomically disadvantaged population with an increased risk of stillbirth. Factors independently associated with non-left side going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results Self-reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left (30%), right (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%), and other (6%). The majority (68%) had received advice about pregnancy sleep position. A non-left position was more likely to be reported by women of Maori (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.46-5.78) ethnicity, and those who did not sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR, 3.29; 95% CI, 2.03-5.32). Most (87%) non-left sleepers reported that they would have minimal difficulty changing to going to sleep on their left side in late pregnancy if this was better for their fetus. Discussion The results from this survey suggest that going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy is likely to be readily modifiable. This suggests that a public health intervention, about the importance of optimal late pregnancy going-to-sleep position to optimise fetal well-being, is likely to be feasible in similar communities with an increased risk of stillbirth.

AB  - Problem/Condition: Certain modifiable maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy are associated with adverse health outcomes for the mother and her infant (e.g., physical abuse, insufficient folic acid consumption, smoking during pregnancy, and improper infant sleep position). Information about these behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends in maternal and infant health, enhance understanding of the relation between maternal behaviors and infant health outcomes, plan and evaluate maternal and infant health programs, direct policy decisions, and monitor progress toward achieving the national Healthy People 2010 [HP 2010] objectives (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy people 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington, DC: US Department of Health and Human Services; 2000).Reporting Period Covered: 2000--2003.Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers; nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants. This report summarizes data for 2000--2003 from 19 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia) that measured progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives for eight perinatal indicators: 1) pregnancy intention, 2) multivitamin use, 3) physical abuse, 4) cigarette smoking during pregnancy, 5) cigarette smoking cessation, 6) drinking alcohol during pregnancy, 7) breastfeeding initiation, and 8) infant sleep position.Results: In 2003, prevalence of intended pregnancy among women having a live birth ranged from 48.1% in Louisiana to 66.5% in Maine; during 2000--2003, no state experienced a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase in prevalence of intended pregnancy, and one state experienced a significant decrease. In 2003, prevalence of multivitamin use at least four times per week during the month before pregnancy ranged from 23.0% in Arkansas to 45.2% in Maine; during 2000--2003, multivitamin use increased significantly in three states (Illinois, North Carolina, and Utah). In 2003, prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during the 12 months before pregnancy ranged from 2.2% in Maine to 7.6% in New Mexico; during 2000--2003, significant decreases were recorded in three states (Alaska, Hawaii, and Nebraska). In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from cigarette smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 72.5% in West Virginia to 96.1% in Utah; during 2000--2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of smoking cessation during pregnancy ranged from 30.2% in West Virginia to 65.8% in Utah; during 2000--2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 91.3% in Colorado to 98.0% in Utah; during 2000--2003, abstinence increased significantly in Louisiana and Utah but decreased significantly in Florida and Nebraska. In 2003, prevalence of mothers who breastfed their babies in the early postpartum period ranged from 51.2% in Louisiana to 90.3% in Alaska; during 2000--2003, significant increases were recorded in six states (Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, and South Carolina). In 2003, prevalence of healthy full-term infants who were placed to sleep on their backs ranged from 50.0% in Arkansas to 78.7% in Washington; during 2000--2003, significant increases were recorded in eight states (Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, and West Virginia). In 2003, all 19 states achieved or exceeded the HP 2010 objective for smoking cessation during pregnancy, and 16 states achieved the HP 2010 objective for abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy. In addition, nearly half of the states achieved the objectives for breastfeeding in the early postpartum period and infant back sleep position. However, no state achieved the HP 2010 objectives for intended pregnancy, multivitamin use before pregnancy, absence of physical abuse before pregnancy, or abstinence from smoking during pregnancy.Interpretation: PRAMS data indicate variability among states regarding progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives in the area of maternal and child health. More progress has been made in achieving objectives focused on the period during and after pregnancy (e.g., smoking cessation and proper infant sleep position); less progress has been made in achieving objectives related to behaviors and experiences in the preconception period (e.g., pregnancy intention and multivitamin use).Public Health Action: State maternal and child health programs can use these state- and population-based data to monitor progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives, identify indicators to target for intervention, and plan and evaluate programs that promote positive maternal and infant health behaviors, experiences, and outcomes. These data also can be used to guide policy decisions that could affect the health of mothers and infants.

AU  - Khan, Rehan
T2  - Current Opinion in Obstetrics & Gynecology
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article aims to draw together recent thinking on pregnancy and obesity, with a particular emphasis on prevention strategies and emerging clinical complications. RECENT FINDINGS: New studies including a large meta-analysis have highlighted that weight reduction strategies are not associated with adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes, and there are suggestions that an approach of dietary modification alone may be associated with reduction in gestational weight gain. These findings are critically discussed with reference to future planned trials. New literature regarding hitherto under-reported complications of obesity in pregnancy such as ischaemic heart disease, schizophrenia and sleep disorders is highlighted. SUMMARY: There will be a need to focus on obesity prevention in the pregnant population as resources will not be adequate to the increasing incidence of the problem.

T2  - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Induction of labour is a common intervention in obstetric practice. Traditionally, in most hospitals induction of labour with medication starts early in the morning, with the start of the working day for the day shift. In human and animal studies spontaneous onset of labour is proven to have a circadian rhythm with a preference for start of labour in the evening. Moreover, when spontaneous labour starts in the evening, the total duration of labour and delivery shortens and fewer obstetric interventions are needed. Based on these observations one might assume that starting induction of labour in the evening, in harmony with the circadian rhythm of natural birth, is more beneficial for both mother and child. To assess whether induction of labour starting in the evening, coinciding with the endogenous circadian rhythm, improves the outcome of labour compared with induction of labour starting in the early morning, organised to coincide with office hours. We contacted the Trials Search Co-ordinator to search the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2012). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to 16 February 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 16 February 2012). We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. We excluded trials that employed quasi-random methods of treatment allocation. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. The search resulted in 2693 articles that we screened on title and abstract for eligibility.Thirteen studies were selected for full text assessment. We included three randomised trials involving 1150 women. Two trials compared the administration of prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening in women with an unfavourable cervix, and one trial compared induction of labour in the morning versus the evening in women with a favourable cervix and/or ruptured membranes with intravenous oxytocin. Because of the different mechanism, we have reported results for these two comparisons separately.In the two trials comparing prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening there were few clinically significant differences between study groups for maternal or neonatal outcomes. One study reported a statistically significant preference by women to start induction of labour with prostaglandins in the morning.In the trial examining induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin, the number of neonatal admissions was statistically significantly increased in the group of women that started induction in the morning. This finding was unexpected, and while the trial authors offered some possible explanations for this, it is important that any future trials examine neonatal outcomes. Taking into account women's preferences that favoured administration of prostaglandins in the morning, we conclude that caregivers should preferably consider administering prostaglandins in the morning.There is no strong evidence that induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is more or less effective than induction in the morning. Consideration may be given to start induction of labour with oxytocin in the evening when indicated.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Objectives To determine the incidence of admission in labor after morphine sleep (therapeutic rest), patient characteristics associated with labor, and adverse outcomes associated with treatment. Methods We reviewed medical records of women treated with morphine sleep from December 2005 to December 2009. Variables evaluated included medications used for treatment, cervical examination, maternal demographic characteristics and obstetric history, fetal heart rate patterns, and maternal/neonatal outcomes. These characteristics were compared between those admitted in labor after morphine sleep versus those discharged. Results Fifty-eight women received morphine sleep: 36 (62%) were admitted in labor, 17 (29%) were discharged, and 5 (9%) were admitted secondary to category II fetal heart rate tracings. All fetuses had category I fetal heart rate tracings prior to treatment. Median dose of morphine sulfate was 20 mg. Those with effacement > 50% (p < 0.01) and carrying term gestations (p < 0.01) were more likely to be admitted in labor after treatment. There were no adverse maternal outcomes. There were no significant differences in neonatal outcomes. Conclusion Sixty-two percent of women were admitted in labor aftermorphine sleep. Admission effacement > 50% and term gestational age were associated with admission in labor. There were no significant differences inmaternal or neonatalmorbidity in those admitted versus discharged home after treatment with morphine sleep.

TI  - Mother-infant bedsharing is associated with an increase in infant heart rate.
AU  - Richard CA
AU  - Mosko SS
T2  - Sleep
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that mother-infant bed sharing, compared to solitary sleeping, would be associated with higher infant heart rates. The objective was to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported, differences in the same infants. DESIGN: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a room alone. SETTING: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the study. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Analysis of variance indicated that, irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.

AB  - QUESTIONIs a structured behavioural intervention (SBI) for infant sleep problems effective for maternal depression, parenting style, and child mental health and sleep outcomes at 2 years?METHODSDesign: cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Allocation: concealed.Blinding: blinded {families, nurses, data collectors, and data analysts}.*Follow-up period: {17 months}.*Setting: 49 maternal and child health centres in 6 government areas in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Patients: 328 mothers (mean age 33 y) who reported infant sleep problems (mean infant age 7.4 mo, 54% boys). Infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation and mothers who did not know sufficient English to complete questionnaires were excluded. Intervention: 25 centres (n = 174) were allocated to SBIs to improve infant sleep, and 24 centres (n = 154) were allocated to usual well-child care. In the SBI group, 100 families accepted the offer of help from nurses and were given sleep management plans based on adult fading (mother sits with infant until infant falls asleep and slowly removes her presence over 2-3 wks) (n = 7) or graduated extinction (mother responds to infant's cry at increasing time intervals) (n = 53) or were taught simple strategies (positive bedtime routine or management of pacifiers) (n = 20). Nurses did not record the choice of SBI in 20 families.Outcomes: maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score >9 or >/= 13), parenting practices, child mental health, and child sleep problems (as reported by mother).Patient follow-up: outcome data were available for 100% of centres and 83% of families at child age 2 years (intention-totreat analysis).MAIN RESULTSFewer mothers in the SBI group had depression compared with the usual care group (table). Groups did not differ for parenting practices, child sleep problems (table), or child mental health.CONCLUSIONA behavioural intervention for infant sleep problems improved maternal depression but did not differ from usual well-child care for child sleep problems or mental health at child age 2 years.*Information provided by author.

AB  - Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a potentially fatal form of heart failure associated with pregnancy. A 29-yearold African American woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 36 weeks' gestation had a history of cardiomyopathy, morbid obesity (body mass index > 70 kg/m[2]), uncontrolled hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and required a repeat cesarean delivery. The patient was admitted to the hospital several times throughout her pregnancy for congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and headaches. Two years previously the patient received a diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy 3 weeks after the delivery of her second child.This case report illustrates the recognition of peripartum cardiomyopathy and the risks early in pregnancy. It also describes the appropriate medical management, including transesophageal echocardiography and the need for collaboration of multiple medical specialists before and during delivery to provide the best possible outcome for both mother and infant.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there is considerable evidence of a relationship between the sensorimotor disorder restless legs syndrome (RLS) and pain disorders, including migraine and fibromyalgia. An association between multi-site pain and RLS has been reported in adult women. In the current study, we explored the association between musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and RLS in a large cohort of young adults.Methods: Twenty two year olds (n = 1072), followed since birth of part of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, provided data on MSK pain (duration, severity, frequency, number of pain sites). RLS was considered present when 4 diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening symptoms during the evening/night) and participants had these symptoms at least 5 times per month. Associations between MSK pain and RLS were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression with bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals, with final models adjusted for sex, psychological distress and sleep quality.Results: The prevalence of RLS was 3.0 % and MSK pain was reported by 37.4 % of the participants. In multivariable logistic regression models, strong associations were found between RLS-diagnosis and long duration (three months or more) of MSK pain (odds ratio 3.6, 95 % confidence interval 1.4-9.2) and reporting three or more pain sites (4.9, 1.6-14.6).Conclusions: Different dimensions of MSK pain were associated with RLS in young adults, suggestive of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Overlap between these conditions requires more clinical and research attention.

TI  - Music as a health patterning modality for preterm infants in the NICU.
AU  - Neal DO
AB  - Preterm birth is on the rise causing neonatal mortality and is a major determinant of early childhood mortality and morbidity in the United States. Numerous preterm infants suffer from neurological disability including cerebral palsy; visual and hearing impairments; learning difficulties; and, psychological, behavioral, and social problems. This increasing incidence of prematurity, prevalence of significant morbidity, and burden to society, both personal and cost-related, make it imperative to identify developmental care strategies such as music that might reduce this burden.This study integrates the work of music therapy, neuroscience, audiology, and medicine with nursing to address the uncertainty regarding the effect of music as a holistic health patterning modality and discover if preterm infant physiological and neurobehavioral state responses to music and ambient noise are different. The goal of this study was to establish a foundation for further research related to the use of music with preterm infants and to address the issue of safety in providing music as a health patterning modality for this population.Forty-one clinically stable, non-ventilated, appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) preterm infants from 32 to 35 weeks gestation in a large, urban Midwest Children's Hospital NICU were included in this study. An interrupted time-series design with repeated measures was used to explore the health patterning responses of preterm infants to an intentionally designed music intervention of recorded piano music. The effect of the music was measured every 30-seconds before, during, and after the sound condition of music or ambient noise by observing the oxygen saturation, heart rate, and behavioral state of randomly assigned preterm infants in the NICU in relation to a control group in which no music (only standard NICU care with recorded ambient noise) was provided.Mixed modeling was used to look at how preterm infant responses varied over time as well as changes between music and ambient noise groups of infants. Although there were no significant differences between group responses over the three time periods, there were significant changes in individual infant oxygen saturations, heart rates, and behavioral states over time. Infant oxygen saturations did not change significantly in the 10 minutes before the sound (p = .97) or during the 20 minutes of sound (p = .75); however, preterm oxygen saturation decreased significantly in the 10 minutes after presentation of the sound conditions (p = .004). Infant heart rates did not change significantly before the sound (p = .71) or during the sound (p = .54); however, preterm heart rate changes after the sound conditions approached significance by increasing during the 10 minutes after the sound conditions (p = .07). Infant behavioral states changed significantly before the sound as infants went from a state of active sleep to quiet sleep (p = .04) and after the sound as infants became slightly more aroused going from quiet sleep to active sleep (p = .05). There were no significant preterm infant behavioral state changes over the time period during the sound conditions (p = .22).Infants listening to music and those listening to ambient noise recorded from the inside of an incubator all exhibited changes in oxygen saturations, heart rates, and behavioral states during the three time periods and variability in those changes; however, these responses remained within normal limits. Findings from this study demonstrated that preterm infants in a NICU did not have adverse reactions to a carefully designed music intervention.

T2  - Acta Paediatrica
AB  - Aim: To determine the effect of music on sleep-wake cycle (SWC) patterns in late preterm neonates.Methods: In a masked crossover study, infants between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks gestation were randomised to music exposure either during the first six or last six hours of a 12-hour observation period. SWC characteristics were determined by continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) read by two coders masked to exposure sequence. Analysis was performed in paired comparisons. ANOVA was used to assess the effects of music exposure, period and crossover on SWC outcomes: (i) Burdjalov Scores (BS) during active sleep (AS) (ii) per cent and duration of quiet sleep (QS).Results: Thirty infants were studied. A total of 222 QS cycles (median seven per patient; range five to 12) were analysed. Music exposure was associated with higher BS (F = 10.60, p = 0.0019) in AS and decreased interruptions during QS. The advanced postconceptual age (PCA) SWC pattern during AS was equivalent to a one-week mean. Number, duration and ratio of QS cycles did not change with music exposure.Conclusion: Music exposure elicits an increasing PCA pattern in AS and fewer interruptions in QS. Music may benefit sleep in late preterm infants.

T2  - Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn from 20 mothers about their experience of sleep during pregnancy and the immediate months of becoming a new mother. The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. METHODS: Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps, development of a 'sleep consciousness,' and bed-sharing. Mercer's stages of becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes into their lives.

AB  - Background: Some studies report neurobehavioral symptoms in neonates exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in utero. However, maternal psychiatric illness during the last trimester of pregnancy, as a confounding factor, has not always been assessed.Aims: In this prospective study we compared neurobehavioral complications among neonates who were born to euthymic women who either took or did not take an SRI during the last trimester of pregnancy.Study Design: Exposed and unexposed infants were assessed for: 1) temperament as measured by the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS); 2) activity via Actiwatch electronic monitoring; 3) sleep state using trained observer ratings; and 4) perinatal complications through medical record review. T-tests, Fisher's exact tests, and analyses of covariance were used to assess the relationship between clinical and neurobehavioral factors and exposure status.Subjects: 67 infants (61 controls and 6 exposed to SRIs).Outcome Measures: Neonatal Assessment Behavioral Scale, APGAR scores, infant sleep state (% sleep, % wakeful), startles and tremulousness, gestational age, birth weight, and head circumference.Results: Infants exposed to SRIs in the third trimester had poorer motor development, lower 5-minute APGAR scores, and shorter mean gestational age as compared to unexposed infants.Conclusion: Results of this study show differences in autonomic and gross motor activity between neonates who were or were not exposed to SRIs in utero after controlling for active maternal psychiatric illness. Future longitudinal work should compare longer term outcomes of exposed and unexposed infants of depressed mothers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P < .003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P < .003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1[beta] were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-[alpha], interferon-[gamma], and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups. CONCLUSION: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 births in the United States and results in craniofacial dysmorphologic condition and learning disabilities. In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal death and learning deficits. The gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunit GABAbeta3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented alcohol-induced damage through GABAbeta3. STUDY DESIGN: With a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 microg). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for GABAbeta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher protected least significant difference. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours and 10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAbeta3 in the embryos (P < or = .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAbeta3 was higher in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was not prevented by the peptides. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the neuropeptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAbeta3 expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft lip and palate.

AB  - The health of future generations, both physical and psychological, depends upon good parental and early environment, free particularly from malnutrition, toxins and undue stress. Education about these negative influences is urgent, especially to encourage childbearing women in a healthy diet and lifestyle. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoking in pregnancy have been known since the 1970s, yet in Germany, for example, 60% of all children are conceived, carried, born into a household where at least one adult smokes. Even if the father desists from smoking at home, the nicotine in his body tissues is transmitted to anyone near him, for example his wife when they sleep near each other. More than one glass of beer, wine or spirits per week during the pregnancy can be detected at birth. Alcohol in early in the pregnancy -- just when many mothers are unaware they are pregnant -- can produce significant physical malformation, especially in the face. Prenatal exposure to alcohol has significant effects on the intelligence and behaviour of the child. Many of these children are very restless. Even slight amounts of poisoning during the pregnancy are related to the development of a negative self-image and the compensatory behaviour of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder in later life. The Prenatal Deprivation and Poisoning Syndromes have not only been related to heart disease and eating disorders in the area of general health but also in the area of psychological health to the Borderline Personality Disorder. Undue stress of any kind during the pregnancy leads to problems for the developing child.

T2  - Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health
AB  - Introduction The aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the effects of night work on the major stages of women's reproductive health, specifically the menstrual cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Current understanding suggests that night work (work that causes disruption of a worker's circadian [day/night] rhythms) adversely affects workers' health and well-being. A complex relationship exists between circadian rhythms and reproductive hormones, and this may potentially increase the vulnerability of women to the detrimental effect of night work, including during menopause. Methods A systematic search was conducted (March-May 2011) via CINAHL, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source Premier for primary research studies written in English using the key words 'shift-work' and 'female/women.' Findings of identified articles were themed to pregnancy, fertility, aspects of menstrual cycles, and menopause. Results Twenty articles were identified, (13 articles concerning pregnancy, 3 addressing fertility, and 4 addressing aspects of the menstrual cycle) but no studies addressing menopause were located. All identified articles demonstrated problematic approaches to the determination of night-work exposure. Discussion Evidence of the impact of night work on female reproductive health as presented in the current literature is inconclusive. Moreover, available evidence needs to be interpreted with caution, given the various limitations and inconsistencies among the studies in the measurement of night-work exposure and shift-work patterns. Studies that focus specifically on night work are needed to facilitate an understanding of the impact of circadian disruption on the reproductive health of women undertaking night work.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe sleep duration and quality in the first month postpartum and compare the sleep of women who exclusively breastfed at night to those who used formula. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study in a predominantly low-income and ethnically diverse sample of 120 first-time mothers. Both objective and subjective measures of sleep were obtained using actigraphy, diary, and self-report data. Measures were collected in the last month of pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Infant feeding diaries were used to group mothers by nighttime breastfeeding behavior. RESULTS: Mothers who used at least some formula at night (n = 54) and those who breastfed exclusively (n = 66) had similar sleep patterns in late pregnancy. However, there was a significant group difference in nocturnal sleep at one month postpartum as measured by actigraphy. Total nighttime sleep was 386 ± 66 minutes for the exclusive breastfeeding group and 356 ± 67 minutes for the formula group. The groups did not differ with respect to daytime sleep, wake after sleep onset (sleep fragmentation), or subjective sleep disturbance at one month postpartum. CONCLUSION: Women who breastfed exclusively averaged 30 minutes more nocturnal sleep than women who used formula at night, but measures of sleep fragmentation did not differ. New mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively since breastfeeding may promote sleep during postpartum recovery. Further research is needed to better understand how infant feeding method affects maternal sleep duration and fragmentation. CITATION: Doan T; Gay CL; Kennedy HP; Newman J; Lee KA.

AB  - We prospectively examined the associations of nighttime and daytime sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy with labor duration and risk of cesarean deliveries in a convenience sample of 120 nulliparous women who completed sleep-related questionnaires and wore wrist actigraphs for up to 7 days. Nap duration and 24-hour sleep duration were inversely associated with labor duration in women with vaginal delivery. Neither actigraphy-derived nor self-reported sleep variables were associated with type of delivery (e.g., vaginal, cesarean). Results showed a beneficial effect of sleep on labor duration and suggest that studies of sleep duration effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes require a consideration of the amount of both daytime and nighttime sleep. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Night waking in preschoolers has been associated with adverse health outcomes in cross-sectional studies, but has rarely been analyzed in a longitudinal setting. Therefore, little is known about the evolution of night waking in early childhood. The objectives of the present study were: to identify night-waking trajectories in preschoolers, and to examine the risk factors associated with those trajectories. Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Data on a child's night waking at the ages of two, three, and five, six years, and potential confounders, were collected through parental self-reported questionnaires. Night-waking trajectories were computerized using group-based trajectory modeling on 1346 children. Two distinct developmental patterns were identified: the "2-5 rare night-waking" (77% of the children) and the "2-5 common night-waking" pattern. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated with the trajectories. Risk factors for belonging to the "2-5 common night-waking" trajectory were: exposure to passive smoking at home, daycare in a collective setting, watching television for extended periods, bottle feeding at night, high emotionality, and low shyness. This approach allowed identification of risk factors associated with night waking during a critical age window, and laid the groundwork for identifying children at higher risk of deleterious sleep patterns. Those risk factors were mainly living habits, which indicated that prevention and intervention programs could be highly beneficial in this population.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD); non-intubated control (MC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to study genetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2 weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive for producing behavioral effects.

T2  - Indian Journal of Pediatrics
AB  - With rapid urbanization and life style changes, loud noise is omnipresent and has become a part of life. Indoor and outdoor environmental noise pollution have been documented as a serious health hazard with increasing adverse effects on fetus, infants, children, adolescents and adults. Noise induced hearing loss and non-auditory adverse effects due to noise pollution, are being increasingly diagnosed in all age groups including the fetus. Outdated motorized vehicles, machinery, increasing traffic, congested residential areas, crowded educational institutions and workplaces, unregulated commercial and industrial noise have become a source of noise pollution with long-term disability. Areas of noise pollution must be identified and corrective measures be taken. Toys, personal, domestic, commercial, industrial equipment should be within the safe sound intensity. Loudspeakers and vehicular horns should be banned except in emergencies. Nocturnal noise pollution must be avoided near residential areas as sleep disturbances have serious long-term health consequences. Pregnant women, fetus, newborns, infants and children are most susceptible to noise induced health hazards and should be given utmost protection. Educational institutions, workplaces, commercial and industrial areas should be regularly monitored for noise levels and protective ear muffs and plugs be used. Public be educated repeatedly regarding health hazards of noise. Traffic noise should be regulated to be within safe limits. Bus-stands, railway stations and airports should be moved away from residential areas. Houses should be sound proofed suitably. Long term studies should be conducted in pregnant women, newborn children and adults to have more data on hazards of noise pollution.

AU  - MANESS, DAVID L.
AU  - KHAN, MUNEEZA
T2  - American Family Physician
AB  - Insomnia affects 10% to 30% of the population with a total cost of $92.5 to $107.5 billion annually. Short-term, chronic, and other types of insomnia are the three major categories according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd ed. The criteria for diagnosis are difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or early awakening despite the opportunity for sleep; symptoms must be associated with impaired daytime functioning and occur at least three times per week for at least one month. Factors associated with the onset of insomnia include a personal or family history of insomnia, easy arousability, poor self-reported health, and chronic pain. Insomnia is more common in women, especially following menopause and during late pregnancy, and in older adults. A comprehensive sleep history can confirm the diagnosis. Psychiatric and medical problems, medication use, and substance abuse should be ruled out as contributing factors. Treatment of comorbid conditions alone may not resolve insomnia. Patients with movement disorders (e.g., restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder), circadian rhythm disorders, or breathing disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) must be identified and treated appropriately. Chronic insomnia is associated with cognitive difficulties, anxiety and depression, poor work performance, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Insomnia can be treated with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Nonpharmacologic therapies include sleep hygiene, cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapy, multicomponent therapy, and paradoxical intention. Referral to a sleep specialist may be considered for refractory cases.

AB  - Objective: To systematically review the literature regarding non-pharmacological inteventions for improving sleep quality and insomnia during pregnancy. Methods: An electronic search strategy was conducted using several online databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Medline, Index to Chiropractic Literature) from inception to March 2013. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies evaluating non-pharmacological interventions, published in English in a peer reviewed journal, and assessed sleep quality or insomnia. The full text of suitable articles was reviewed by the authors, and scored using a risk of bias assessment. Results: 160 articles were screened and seven studies met the inclusion criteria in the form of three prospective RCTs, one prospective longitudinal trial, one experimental pilot study, and two prospective quasi-randomized trials. Quality scores ranged from five to eight out of twelve on the risk of bias scoring criteria. Conclusions: Exercise, massage, and acupuncture may be associated with improved sleep quality during pregnancy, however, due to the low quality and heterogeneity of the studies yielded, a definitive recommendation cannot be made. Further higher quality research is indicated.

AB  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman's life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause.

T2  - Seminars in Fetal & Neonatal Medicine
AB  - This article reviews three new and emerging risk factors for stillbirth that may be modifiable or might identify a compromised fetus. We focus on fetal movements, maternal sleep, and maternal diet. Recent studies have suggested than a sudden increase in vigorous fetal activity may be associated with increased risk of stillbirth. We review the papers that have reported this finding and discuss the implications as well as potential future directions for research. There is emerging literature to suggest that maternal sleep position may be a risk for stillbirth, especially if the woman settles to sleep supine. This risk is biologically plausible. How this knowledge may be utilized to assist stillbirth reduction strategies is discussed. Finally, we examine the somewhat limited literature regarding maternal diet and pregnancy outcome. Introducing probiotics into the diet may prove useful, but further work is required. The possible next steps for research are considered, as well as some potential intervention strategies that may ultimately lead to stillbirth reduction.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy of the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is to determine whether sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.Study Design: NuMoM2b is a prospective cohort study of 10,037 nulliparous women with singleton gestations that was conducted across 8 sites with a central Data Coordinating and Analysis Center. The Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy recruited 3702 women from the cohort to undergo objective, overnight in-home assessments of sleep disordered breathing. A standardized level 3 home sleep test was performed between 6(0)-15(0) weeks' gestation (visit 1) and again between 22(0)-31(0) weeks' gestation (visit 3). Scoring of tests was conducted by a central Sleep Reading Center. Participants and their health care providers were notified if test results met "urgent referral" criteria that were based on threshold levels of apnea hypopnea indices, oxygen saturation levels, or electrocardiogram abnormalities but were not notified of test results otherwise. The primary pregnancy outcomes to be analyzed in relation to maternal sleep disordered breathing are preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, and preterm birth.Results: Objective data were obtained at visit 1 on 3261 women, which was 88.1% of the studies that were attempted and at visit 3 on 2511 women, which was 87.6% of the studies that were attempted. Basic characteristics of the substudy cohort are reported in this methods article.Conclusion: The substudy was designed to address important questions regarding the relationship of sleep-disordered breathing on the risk of preeclampsia and other outcomes of relevance to maternal and child health.

AB  - This is a descriptive and exploratory study that aims to assess the most frequent nursing diagnoses among pregnant patients with hypertension from a public hospital. Ten pregnant patients underwent a semi-structured interview and a physical examination. Data collection tools were based on Gordon's Functional Health Patterns. Data were analyzed, categorized and synthesized following the hypothetical-deductive model of Gordon. Thirteen diagnoses were identified. The most frequent ones were: poor knowledge about the health problem; ineffective health maintenance; ineffective management of therapeutic regimen; anxiety; disturbed sleep pattern; disturbed body image; altered sexuality patterns and fluid volume excess. These results show us the main nursing problems that pregnant women with hypertension present. It also points out the need to improve health education practices in this population.

AB  - This is an analytical-descriptive retrospective study, carried out in the Family Health Unit of Vila Real, in Marilia - SP, whose aims had been to elaborate the nursing diagnosis according to classification of North American Diagnoses Association (NANDA) and to elaborate the interventions of nursing for these diagnosis, having as base the record analysis of 40 pregnant women registered in the program of prenatal of that Unit. The data collection, in records, was carried out from April 1st to August 4th, 2005. Eleven nursing diagnosis had been elaborated: nauseas, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, disturbed standard of sleep, chronic pain, extreme volume of liquid, risk for impaired breast-feeding, impaired urinary elimination, unbalanced nutrition for more or less than the corporal necessities and risk for impaired maternity or paternity. The interventions of nursing for each one of these diagnosis had been elaborated in accordance with pertinent literature. When concluding the work we could verify that the survey of the diagnosis and the nursing interventions provided to the nurses an adequacy in the conduction of the work process.

AB  - This descriptive research aimed to analyze the Nursing Diagnoses identified in low-risk pregnant patients. Eleven pregnant women received prenatal care in a safe maternity in the state of Goias. The data were classified under the NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) taxonomy II and analyzed according to the referrals in obstetrics. Twenty-five different Nursing Diagnoses were identified. All pregnant women presented: insufficient knowledge (different levels and subjects), disturbed sleep pattern, activity intolerance, self care deficit (bathing and hygiene), stress urinary incontinence, and some risk diagnoses. Identifying NANDA's Nursing Diagnoses allows the identification of the risk level, early detection of complications, and individualization in nursing assistance.

AB  - We aimed to analyze the responses of pregnant women pertaining to the sleep and rest class of the activity and rest domain of NANDA's Taxonomy. This is a cross-sectional study with 66 pregnant women selected by simple randomized sampling, performed in a basic health unit of the city of Fortaleza, from 2004 to 2005. Data collection was accomplished by the use of a form containing defining characteristics and factors related to nursing diagnoses, allowing for the verification of statistical association among these variables. The mean age of the pregnant women was 24,4 years; 78,8% of them had a companion and the family income of 86,4% was between 1 to 3 minimum wages. The standard diagnosis of disturbed sleep was associated to waking up three or more times during the night, annoyance and urinary urgency. The diagnosis of sleep deprivation did not present statistical association with the studied variables. We concluded that the standard disturbed sleep was strongly determined by the occurrence of urinary urgency and had annoyance as a consequence.

TI  - Nutrition, infection and stunting: the roles of deficiencies of individual nutrients and foods, and of inflammation, as determinants of reduced linear growth of children.
AU  - Millward, D. Joe
T2  - Nutrition Research Reviews
AB  - The regulation of linear growth by nutritional and inflammatory influences is examined in terms of growth-plate endochondral ossification, in order to better understand stunted growth in children. Linear growth is controlled by complex genetic, physiological, and nutrient-sensitive endocrine/paracrine/autocrine mediated molecular signalling mechanisms, possibly including sleep adequacy through its influence on growth hormone secretion. Inflammation, which accompanies most infections and environmental enteric dysfunction, inhibits endochondral ossification through the action of mediators including proinflammatory cytokines, the activin A-follistatin system, glucocorticoids and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). In animal models linear growth is particularly sensitive to dietary protein as well as Zn intake, which act through insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding proteins, triiodothyronine, amino acids and Zn2+ to stimulate growth-plate protein and proteoglycan synthesis and cell cycle progression, actions which are blocked by corticosteroids and inflammatory cytokines. Observational human studies indicate stunting to be associated with nutritionally poor, mainly plant-based diets. Intervention studies provide some support for deficiencies of energy, protein, Zn and iodine and for multiple micronutrient deficiencies, at least during pregnancy. Of the animal-source foods, only milk has been specifically and repeatedly shown to exert an important influence on linear growth in both undernourished and well-nourished children. However, inflammation, caused by infections, environmental enteric dysfunction, which may be widespread in the absence of clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and endogenous inflammation associated with excess adiposity, in each case contributes to stunting, and may explain why nutritional interventions are often unsuccessful. Current interventions to reduce stunting are targeting WASH as well as nutrition.

AB  - The United States is in the midst of an obesity crisis. The majority of American women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. The presence of excess body weight in a woman can negatively impact fertility, pregnancy, postnatal recovery, and the health of her child. Psychiatric comorbidities, including eating and mood disorders, can influence nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy and weight loss in the postpartum period. Stress associated with caretaking in the postpartum period impacts levels of sleep and physical activity, which further impact postpartum weight retention. This article reviews the literature in these areas; the article discusses the management of excess body weight during and after pregnancy as well as related psychiatric conditions in pregnant and postpartum women.

AU  - Kriebs, Jan M.
T2  - Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing
AB  - The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among women of childbearing age, not only in the United States but also across the globe, contribute to increased risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Overweight and obesity are quantified by body mass index (BMI) for clinical purposes. In 2010, 31.9% of US women aged 20 to 39 years met the definition of obesity, a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater. Across the life span, obesity is associated with increased risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and other diseases. During pregnancy, increasing levels of prepregnancy BMI are associated with increases in both maternal and fetal/neonatal risks. This article reviews current knowledge about obesity in pregnancy and health risks related to increased maternal BMI, addresses weight stigma as a barrier to care and interventions that have evidence of benefit, and discusses the development of policies and guidelines to improve care.

T2  - Psychiatric Clinics of North America
AB  - Obesity carries a unique disease burden on women and is influenced by a variety of biological, hormonal, environmental, and cultural factors. Reproductive transitions, such as pregnancy and menopause, increase the risk for obesity. Psychologically, obese women experience greater weight-related stigma and discrimination and are at increased risk for depression than obese men. Women are also particularly susceptible to psychological stress, sleep debt, and lack of physical activity, all of which are risk factors for the development of excess weight. Obesity risk is increased among women with psychiatric disorders and those who use certain psychotropic medications. Obesity treatment should take into consideration degree of obesity, health risks, past weight loss attempts, and individual differences in motivation and readiness for treatment.Copyright © 2010 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Abstract: Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Subjects and methods: Between April 2005 and March 2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea–hypopnea index (AHI)>5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI)>25, AHI<5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI<25, AHI<5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson’s and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP. Results: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25±0.23, 0.58±0.55, and 0.51±0.37mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n =23), obese non-apneics (n =45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n =29), respectively. Pearson’s correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p =0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p =0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r =0.22, p =0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r =0.10, p =0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (β=0.02, p =0.01). Conclusions: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - The aims of this paper are to study the associations between objective and subjective sleep in pregnant women, to examine which specific aspects of women's sleep are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and to test the moderating role of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the relations between objective and subjective sleep. The sample included 148 pregnant women. Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy for five nights at the participants' home, and subjective sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale and anxiety symptoms with the Beck anxiety inventory. Significant associations were found between the subjective sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores, but there were no significant associations between actigraphic sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores. Depressive and anxiety scores emerged as significant moderators of the links between objective and subjective sleep. The findings suggest that emotional distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms severity) during pregnancy is associated with subjective sleep disturbances but not with objective sleep disturbances. Importantly, only among women with higher levels of emotional distress was subjective sleep quality associated with objective sleep quality. These findings may suggest that women with higher levels of emotional distress are not necessarily biased in their perception of sleep quality. However, they may perceive fragmented sleep as more detrimental to their wellbeing.

AB  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between OSA and preeclampsia.Methods: Between 30 and 39 weeks gestation, objective sleep apnea were evaluated in 38 normal pregnant and 40 preeclamptic women. Preeclampsia was defined by having a blood pressure (BP) > 140/90 mmHg on two occasions after the 20th week of pregnancy with excess protein in the urine (> 300 mg in 24 h) or 30 mg persistent proteinuria (+ 1 in dipsticks) in random samples. Objective sleep apnea was evaluated using an overnight in-hospital sleep evaluation using the SOMNOwatch plus Respiratory Screener. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5-14.9), moderate (15-29.9), and severe (≥ 30).Results: Mean AHI was 33.3 ± 12.1 in preeclamptic women and was 23.8 ± 15.8 in normal pregnant women (p = 0.008). There was significant difference in prevalence of OSA severity (none, mild, moderate, or severe) between groups. Out of 33 preeclamptic women, 11 women had moderate and 22 women had severe OSA. Whereas, among 33 normal pregnant women, 8, 13, and10 women had mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. Two normal pregnant women had no OSA (AHI< 5).Conclusion: Our study suggests women are susceptible to developing OSA during pregnancy that is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia.

AB  - Background: Experimental and epidemiologic data suggest that among nonpregnant adults, sleep duration may be an important risk factor for chronic disease. Although pregnant women commonly report poor sleep, few studies objectively evaluated the quality of sleep in pregnancy or explored the relationship between sleep disturbances and maternal and perinatal outcomes.Objective: Our objective was to examine the relationship between objectively assessed sleep duration, timing, and continuity (measured via wrist actigraphy) and maternal cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity specific to pregnancy.Study Design: This was a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women. Women were recruited between 16 0/7 and 21 6/7 weeks' gestation. They were asked to wear a wrist actigraphy monitor and complete a daily sleep log for a period of 7 consecutive days. The primary sleep exposure variables were the averages of the following over the total valid nights (minimum 5, maximum 7 nights): short sleep duration during the primary sleep period (<7 h/night), late sleep midpoint (midpoint between sleep onset and sleep offset >5 am), and top quartile of minutes of wake time after sleep onset and sleep fragmentation index. The primary outcomes of interest were a composite of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (mild, severe, or superimposed preeclampsia; eclampsia; or antepartum gestational hypertension) and gestational diabetes mellitus. We used χ2 tests to assess associations between sleep variables and categorical baseline characteristics. Crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from univariate logistic regression models to characterize the magnitude of the relationship between sleep characteristics and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. For associations significant in univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was used to explore further the association of sleep characteristics with pregnancy outcomes.Results: In all, 901 eligible women consented to participate; 782 submitted valid actigraphy studies. Short sleep duration and a later sleep midpoint were associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.53; and odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.36, respectively) but not of hypertensive disorders. A model with both sleep duration and sleep midpoint as well as their interaction term revealed that while there was no significant interaction between these exposures, the main effects of both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.19; and adjusted odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.97, respectively). Additionally, after adjusting separately for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity, both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint remained associated with gestational diabetes. No associations were demonstrated between the sleep quality measures (wake after sleep onset, sleep fragmentation) and hypertensive disorders or gestational diabetes.Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a relationship between short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes. Our data suggest independent contributions of these 2 sleep characteristics to the risk for gestational diabetes in nulliparous women.

AB  - Objective: Our primary purpose was to assess the impact of objectively measured nighttime sleep duration on gestational glucose tolerance. We additionally examined associations of objectively measured daytime sleep duration and nap frequency on maternal glycemic control.Methods: Sixty-three urban, low-income, pregnant women wore wrist actigraphs for an average of 6 full days in mid-pregnancy prior to screening for hyperglycemia using the 1-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with 1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia, defined as 1-h OGTT values ≥130 mg/dL.Results: Mean nighttime sleep duration was 6.9±0.9 h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r=-0.28, P=.03). Shorter nighttime sleep was associated with hyperglycemia, even after controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.1-0.8]). There were no associations of daytime sleep duration and nap frequency with 1-h OGTT values or hyperglycemia.Conclusions: Using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we found that women with shorter nighttime sleep durations had an increased risk for gestational hyperglycemia. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our negative daytime sleep findings.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was shown to be associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, prevalence of OSA in GDM women, its relationship to metabolic control, and predictive factors have not been studied.Material and Methods: Eighty-two obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation participated. The Berlin questionnaire was used to assess OSA symptoms. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained. Those with OSA underwent meal tolerance test (MTT) to assess their metabolic parameters. Classification tree analysis was used to develop a screening tool for OSA.Results: At a median gestational age of 29 weeks, OSA was diagnosed in 52.4% of the women, with a median apnea hypopnea index of 9.4 (interquartile range 6.4, 12.4). More severe OSA was significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose but not HbA1c. For those with OSA, sleep parameters related to oxygen desaturation significantly correlated with higher fasting insulin resistance and more severe β-cell dysfunction, as evaluated by MTT. A screening tool involving two variables, neck circumference and Berlin Questionnaire score, was developed. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 51%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 70%.Conclusion: OSA is prevalent in obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM in the late second to early third trimester. OSA severity, especially the degree of oxygen desaturation, correlated with fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and β-cell function. A simple screening tool involving the Berlin Questionnaire and neck circumference can aid in predicting OSA in this patient group.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction, resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia and sleep fragmentation. Pathophysiological sequelae include sympathetic activation, increased oxidative stress and a generalized inflammatory response, culminating in endothelial dysfunction. These are the proposed mechanisms that mediate the increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease among patients with OSA outside of pregnancy. It is intriguing to consider the consequences of these events on pregnancy outcomes. There is a growing literature on the impact of maternal OSA on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes and impaired fetal growth. The data, while promising, require confirmation with larger numbers to verify the findings. OSA may be an important mediator of the poor perinatal outcomes associated with maternal obesity; moreover, one which may be amenable to treatment. This review discusses OSA and summarizes the current literature linking OSA with adverse perinatal outcomes.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: A recent trend in increasing rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality despite quality improvements has been noted. The goal of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality. DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: A nationally representative sample of maternal hospital discharges from 1998-2009. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: The analytic sample included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000; however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9), eclampsia (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5-10.9), and pulmonary embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4-11.5). The adverse effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may improve pregnancy outcomes in this group. CITATION: Louis JM, Mogos MF, Salemi JL, Redline S, Salihu HM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), cesarean section (CS), low Apgar score (at 5 minutes after delivery), and preeclampsia in pregnant women with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). STUDY DESIGN: Our subjects included 791 women with OSA and 3955 randomly selected women without OSA. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes between women with and without OSA. RESULTS: Compared with women without OSA, adjusted odds ratios for LBW, preterm birth, SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia in women with OSA were 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.40), 2.31 (95% CI, 1.77-3.01), 1.34 (95% CI, 1.09-1.66), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.48-2.04), and 1.60 (95% CI, 2.16-11.26), respectively. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with OSA are at increased risk for having LBW, preterm, and SGA infants, CS, and preeclampsia, compared with pregnant women without OSA.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has a distinctive pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment compared with that of older children and adults. Infants have both anatomical and physiological predispositions toward airway obstruction and gas exchange abnormalities; including a superiorly placed larynx, increased chest wall compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and ventilatory control instability. Congenital abnormalities of the airway, such as laryngomalacia, hemangiomas, pyriform aperture stenosis, choanal atresia, and laryngeal webs, may also have adverse effects on airway patency. Additional exacerbating factors predisposing infants toward airway collapse include neck flexion, airway secretions, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has been associated with failure to thrive, behavioral deficits, and sudden infant death. The proper interpretation of infant polysomnography requires an understanding of normative data related to gestation and postconceptual age for apnea, arousal, and oxygenation. Direct visualization of the upper airway is an important diagnostic modality in infants with obstructive apnea. Treatment options for infant obstructive sleep apnea are predicated on the underlying etiology, including supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia, mandibular distraction for micrognathia, tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, choanal atresia repair, and/or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.

AB  - Objective: Pregnancy and the obesity epidemic impacting women of reproductive age appear to predispose women to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. The aim of this study is to examine the association between OSA and adverse maternal outcomes in a national cohort.Methods: The National Perinatal Information Center in the US was used to identify women with a delivery discharge diagnosis of OSA from 2010 to 2014. We used the International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision to classify OSA diagnosis and maternal outcomes.Measurements: The sample consisted of 1,577,632 gravidas with a rate of OSA of 0.12% (N = 1963). There was a significant association between OSA and preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94-2.54), eclampsia (aOR 2.95, 1.08-8.02), and gestational diabetes (aOR 1.51, 1.34-1.72) after adjusting for a comprehensive list of covariates which includes maternal obesity. OSA status was also associated with a 2.5-3.5-fold increase in risk of severe complications such as cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer (5.1 + 5.6 vs 3.0 + 3.0 days, p < 0.001) and odds of an admission to an intensive care unit higher (aOR 2.74, 2.36-3.18) in women with OSA.Conclusions: Compared to pregnant women without OSA, pregnant women with OSA have a significantly higher risk of pregnancy-specific complications such as gestational hypertensive conditions and gestational diabetes, and rare medical and surgical complications such as cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. OSA diagnosis was also associated with a longer hospital stay and significantly increased odds for admission to the intensive care unit.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the predictive ability of current obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening tools and the individual questions in these tools at identifying pregnant women who have OSA.Methods: A total of 293 third-trimester patients were enrolled between 2010 and 2012, and 248 patients had sleep monitor results. Recruited participants completed a questionnaire consisting of six OSA screening tools and overnight portable sleep monitoring. Predictive ability of the screening tools for OSA compared with results of the diagnosis from overnight sleep monitoring was estimated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curves.Results: Two hundred eighteen (88%) of the patients were OSA-negative, and 30 patients (12%) were OSA-positive based on sleep monitoring results. Compared with OSA-negative patients, OSA-positive patients had greater body mass indices and neck circumferences as well as significantly higher rates of hypertension (chronic and gestational), pregestational diabetes mellitus, asthma, and preeclampsia. The overall predictive ability of the screening tools for OSA was modest (area under receiver operating characteristic curves 0.62-0.695). However, individual components of the questionnaire were strongly associated with OSA.Conclusion: We found that none of the studied OSA screening tools accurately detected OSA in pregnant women in the third trimester. We have identified proposed elements of a new screening tool based on promising components from several tools that may more accurately detect patients with OSA.Level Of Evidence: II.

AB  - Objective:We sought to ascertain the validity of two screening scales for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy and to establish the prevalence of OSA in pregnancy.Study Design:In this prospective observational study, two screening scales were administered. Screen positive subjects were referred for diagnostic polysomnography (PSG); if admitted for antepartum care, screen positive subjects underwent a modified study with a type 3 device (T3D).Result:A total of 1509 subjects underwent OSA screening; 58 completed diagnostic testing. Neither measure was a reliable diagnostic tool for OSA as determined by T3D or PSG (detection rates of 10.3% and 18.0%, respectively). Among screen positive subjects undergoing PSG or T3D testing, 15.5% ultimately met 'gold standard' OSA diagnostic criteria for an estimated point prevalence of 4.9%.Conclusion:In this prospective trial, screening positive on the Berlin questionnaire or Epworth sleepiness scale was poorly predictive of OSA among gravidae and was associated with a high false referral rate.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with adverse fetal outcomes in some studies. Second trimester Down syndrome screening markers reflect fetal and fetoplacental wellbeing. We aimed to compare markers of fetal and feto-placental wellbeing in women with OSA and low risk controls.Methods: A retrospective case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and available second trimester markers was performed. Controls were screened for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) at the time of delivery using a questionnaire. Women at low risk for OSA were selected. Marker levels were adjusted for gestational age and race and reported as multiples of median and later adjusted for body mass index (BMI).Results: Twenty-four OSA cases and 166 controls were identified. Women with OSA had a higher mean BMI when compared to controls (37.1 ± 12.7 versus 24.1 ± 5.1, p = 0.03). Estriol (uE3) multiples of the median (MoM) levels were lower in women with OSA compared to controls, even after adjusting for BMI, 0.74 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.45) versus 1.06 (IQR 0.38), respectively, p = 0.026. Once adjusted for BMI, alpha feto-protein (AFP) MoM levels were no longer significantly different in women with OSA compared to controls.Conclusion: OSA is associated with reduced serum uE3 levels, independently of BMI, possibly indicating fetal distress.

AB  - We employed accepted, validated symptom-based screening measures to discern attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to adverse pregnancy outcomes, taking into account potential maternal confounders. Commonly employed OSA screening measures (Berlin and Epworth scales) were performed in the second and third trimesters; maternal and neonatal outcome data were thereafter obtained. The relationship between OSA and outcomes of interest were explored in stratified and multivariate models controlling for potential confounders. The overall prevalence of OSA was 25.4%. Given a nonlinear increase by body mass index (BMI) strata (8.9%, 46%; p<0.0001), stratified multivariate analysis was subsequently performed. Among nonobese (BMI <30) gravidae, frequency of preeclampsia was significantly higher among women with OSA (adjusted odds ratio=6.58, 95% confidence interval=1.04, 38.51; p=0.035). Among the obese (BMI ≤30) gravidae, infant birth weight ratio (or birth weight by gestational age) was higher with OSA + screening than OSA --(1.099 versus 1.035; p=0.04), and this association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (p=0.05). OSA prevalence increases significantly among obese gravidae, raising concerns for the overall validity of commonly employed screening measures in pregnancy. Nevertheless, OSA status continues to exert an independent influence, as obese and nonobese gravidae are at increased risk for a limited number of adverse perinatal outcomes in multivariate models.

T2  - Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine
AB  - Purpose Of Review: The evidence of a putative causal effect of sleep apnea-induced intermittent hypoxia on the pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is mounting. The present review presents the evidence of current literature and questions whether an early diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy can reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Recent Findings: Although pathophysiological pathways remain to be more clearly defined, recent studies shed light on the association of sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. For the first time, a recent prospective study revealed that obstructive sleep apnea increases over the course of pregnancy and that it is common during the third trimester. In this study, age and BMI have been identified as independent predictors of gestational obstructive sleep apnea. Summary: An association between sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia has been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment during pregnancy on hypertension and preeclampsia. Further studies are required to ascertain whether continuous positive airway pressure can be a useful adjunct treatment for pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia.

TI  - Ongoing education about safe sleep practices to prevent SIDS.
T2  - Patient Education Management
AB  - According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the leading cause of post-neonatal mortality in the United States is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Although great progress has been made in reducing the number of deaths from SIDS, education is still vital. Parents and other caregivers need to understand what a safe sleep environment looks like. In addition, information on other factors that put babies at risk for SIDS must be emphasized, such as smoking during pregnancy. In this issue of Patient Education Management, we explore the issues pertaining to SIDS and discuss where education is needed and the information more parents need to know.

AB  - Ontogeny of arousal data constitute a vital supplement to the sparse literature on spontaneous neuronal activity. These data demonstrate that measurable infant spontaneous arousals (SAs) with an inherent oscillatory entrainment occur six times more in active sleep than in quiet sleep of the same duration and are identifiable as a human neurobiologic function. These SAs are not significantly associated with race or ethnicity, gender, total hours spent sleeping, percent time spent in active or quiet sleep, preterm status, history of a life-threatening event, having had a sibling who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or having had a mother who smoked during this pregnancy. As measurable neurophysiologic events, SAs establish parameters for research at molecular and molar levels focusing on several critical areas: (1) the neuronal control of SA related to neurotransmitters, (2) as a significant antecedent factor in clinical cardiorespiratory events occurring in infants at high epidemiologic risk for SIDS; (3) as a regulatory biologic factor underlying temperament and executive cognitive functioning, and (4) morbidity and mortality effects possibly related to therapeutic interventions that alter SA levels.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in pregnant women with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and iron deficiency or anemia. The open-label pilot study (exploratory) was performed at the University Hospital of Zürich and the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland (Lugano).Patient and Methods: Nineteen women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-to-severe RLS and serum ferritin levels <35 µg/l or hemoglobin (Hb) < 11.0 g/dl were included in the study. RLS was graded according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Study Group rating scale. All participants had a score of ≥20 or had RLS ≥3 times/week. Based on the Hb levels, 500 or 700 mg of FCM was administered over 20 min. The primary end point was a ≥ 50% reduction in the mean IRLS score one week after FCM infusion. The secondary end points included periodic limb movements (PLMs; assessed using nocturnal foot actigraphy), sleep quality (assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and safety.Results: The IRLS score decreased from 23 ± 7 (baseline) to 13 ± 7 (P <0.01), whereas the PLM index decreased from 35 ± 26 (baseline) to 25 ± 20 (P <0.001). Significant improvement in sleep quality was also reported (P <0.029), and treatment was well tolerated. Three serious adverse events were reported, but they were considered unrelated to treatment.Conclusions: These data provide promising evidence on the safety and efficacy of FCM for moderate-to-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anemia. Therefore, a future placebo-controlled study is warranted.

TI  - Opioid Effects on Premature Infant Brain Function Measured by Limited Channel EEG.
AU  - Thorngate, Lauren
AB  - Background and Aim: Neonatal opioid use for pain management and therapeutic sedation may contribute to untoward patterns of brain function, or change rhythmic cycles that form the basis for sleep structure. This study aimed to: 1) describe differences in pattern characteristics of limited channel EEG, and 2) evaluate changes in brain wave signal variability with quantification of cyclicity by spectral density distribution before and after standard morphine administration.Method: This within-subject naturalistic experiment acquired EEG data by limited channel amplitude-integrated (aEEG) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Participants were recruited in two phases: 1) medically stable (n=16, 28-32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) and 2) critically ill receiving morphine for pain or sedation (n=9, 26-39 weeks PMA). The first phase established feasibility, the second employed aEEG to describe brain function before and after opioid administration. Amplitude-integrated EEG signal was quantified by measures of bandwidth voltage, lower border voltage, and variance of each with two simple quantitative measures of peak counts 10 microV above baseline, and proportion of time below 10 microV. Further analysis presented frequency changes across time to describe morphine effect on EEG spectral measures in younger infants who received morphine in the NICU.Results: Less mature infants had higher peak counts and more time at low voltage within epoch: median peak counts 3.625 (SD1.740), median proportion less than 10 microV 22% (SD 0.200). Except for spectral edge frequency (SEF50), morphine effect did not emerge until focused analysis included mini-bands (2Hz) of spectral power. Moreover, the log transformed 'mini-band' of 14-16 Hz showed a significant difference in mean rank (n=9, chi 2 = 5.444, df=1, p<.020) between 15 minutes prior and 60 minutes after the dose. Younger infants demonstrated high power in lower frequency (delta) bands. Among older infants, shifts within the spectrum after morphine administration were observed from high frequency bands toward lower frequencies.Conclusion: Description of brain function patterns is quantifiable. Although morphine effects may be masked by the heavy presence of power in the delta range early in gestation, exploration of spectral densities offers a framework for understanding shifts of spectral frequencies in premature infant brain function.

AB  - Background: Among the various factors that may influence the pharmacological response to opioids, genetic polymorphisms [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)] have generated some interest.Objectives: To examine the influence on morphine dose requirements and adverse events in the postoperative period of four SNP [opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1) ex-21 and ex-26, catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT)] in candidate genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.Design: A single centre prospective study.Setting: University Hospital, Paris, France, from 2 January 2007 to 15 November 2011.Patients: A total of 438 white adults scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery (spine, hip and knee) under general anaesthesia. The main exclusion criteria were receiving opioids for chronic pain, nonopioid drugs within 2 days prior to surgery, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, sleep apnoea obstruction syndrome, morbid obesity, severe hepatic impairment, cognitive dysfunction.Interventions: Assays of plasma concentrations of morphine and metabolites (morphine 3-glucuronide and morphine 6-glucuronide) were performed and common polymorphisms in four candidate genes [OPRM1 A118G rs1799971; P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) T3435C (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582); COMT Val 158 Met (rs4680)] were analysed.Morphine was titrated by staff in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) and in the ward patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was used for 24 h.Main Outcome Measures: The dose of morphine required to achieve pain relief and the influence of SNP in genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and kinetics on morphine dose requirements. Secondary endpoints were the concentrations of morphine, morphine 6-glucuronide and morphine 3-gluguronide, the proportion of patients requiring a rescue analgesic and the proportion of morphine-related adverse events.Results: A total of 404 patients completed the study to final analysis. The mean ± SD morphine dose to achieve pain relief was 15.8 ± 8.8 mg in the PACU and 22.7 ± 18.6 mg during patient-controlled intravenous administration. Morphine-related adverse events were observed in 37%. There was no relationship between any genetic polymorphisms and morphine dose, morphine 3-gluguronide and morphine 6-glucuronide concentration, morphine-related adverse events or pain level. In the PACU only, P-glycoprotein polymorphisms (ex-21; ex-26) were significantly associated with morphine concentration but the prediction of the model was poor (R = 0.04) CONCLUSION: No major relationship has been demonstrated between SNP of OPRM1, ABCB1, COMT and morphine requirement, pain level or adverse effects in the postoperative period.Trial Registration: NCT00822549 (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

AB  - Organic anion and cation transporters (OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs) mediate the proximal tubular secretion of numerous clinically important compounds, including various commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals. Here, we report determination of the ontogeny of these transporters and of NaP(i)2 and SGLT1, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to determine expression levels of transporter genes in rat embryonic kidneys on each day of gestation from embryonic day (ed) 13 to ed18, in cultures of induced and uninduced metanephric mesenchyme (MM), and on each day of 1 week of whole embryonic kidney (WEK) culture. We also examined ontogeny of Oat1 protein expression in rat embryonic kidney by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we used uptake of fluorescein (FL) as a novel in vitro functional assay of OAT expression in WEK and MM. Developmental induction of OAT and OCT genes does not occur uniformly: some genes are induced early (e.g., Oat1 and Oat3, potential early markers of proximal tubulogenesis), and others after kidney development is relatively advanced (e.g., Oct1, a potential marker of terminal differentiation). The ontogeny of transporter genes in WEK and MM is similar to that observed in vivo, indicating that these organ culture systems may represent convenient in vitro models to study the developmental induction of OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs. Functional transport was evidenced by accumulation of FL in the developing tubule in WEK and MM organ cultures. Our findings on the renal ontogeny of OATs and OCTs could carry implications both for the development of more rational therapeutics for premature infants, as well as for our understanding of proximal tubule differentiation.

AB  - Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a focal neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary sustained and often painful muscle contraction, usually producing repetitive movements or abnormal positions of the mouth, jaw and/or tongue. We report on a 30-year-old woman affected with OMD with a 12-year follow-up. Focal dystonia involved an involuntary activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles causing forceful jaw displacement in the maximal protrusive position. These episodes initially occurred during jaw function and increased up to an open-lock with bilateral pre-auricular pain. Dystonic spasms were absent during sleep and were reduced temporarily by sensory tricks. Treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was performed during three different sessions over a 1-year period. Electromyographic-guided BTX injections into the lateral pterygoid muscles were given with cannula electrodes. Botox reduced the involuntary activity of the muscles. Recurrence and exacerbation of dystonic symptoms occurred during the two pregnancies and completely disappeared immediately after both deliveries with prolonged symptom-free periods. During the last 8 years, the patient had a slight relapse of symptoms during flu attacks, periods of stress and during menses. The temporal pattern of these symptoms indicates a possible relationship between OMD and hormonal factors.

AB  - Abstract The development of synaptic connections in the foetus' brain peaks during the third trimester of gestation. In case of preterm birth, the infant is vulnerable in the neonatal intensive care unit because of its immature and rapidly developing neurologic system. Therefore, developmental care interventions (DCI) are particularly important during the NICU hospitalization to optimize short and long-term outcomes, as well as neurodevelopment, in infants born prematurely. The aim of this article is to provide a narrative overview by summarizing findings of a thorough literature review on the latest findings regarding the effectiveness of six DCI on preterm infant's outcomes such as sleep, stress and neurodevelopment. Various DCI have been evaluated in empirical studies. Research related to these interventions is rapidly evolving but is still a priority in the neonatal research field.

AB  - Background: The objective of our study was to determine demographic characteristics, health and sexual behaviors, and psychological health associated with pregnancy ambivalence. We used a cross-sectional design for our study. Methods: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted among nonpregnant women 16-40 years old from southeast Texas from July 2010 to August 2011. The survey included questions pertaining to demographics, pregnancy intentions, health behaviors, sexual behaviors, violence exposure, pregnancy coercion, and psychological behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine differences between ambivalent and nonambivalent females. Results: Of the 1,388 women included in this analysis, 529 (38%) were ambivalent toward pregnancy. Ambivalent women were younger ( p=0.03), had fewer children living at home ( p<0.01), and were less likely to have been previously pregnant ( p=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that ambivalent women were more likely to smoke ( p<0.01), sleep poorly ( p=0.02), have had more sexual partners in the past month ( p<0.01) and in their lifetime ( p=0.01), not used contraception at last sex ( p=0.01), be a victim of violence ( p=0.01), and have experienced pregnancy coercion ( p<0.01). In addition, these women exhibited higher scores on scales measuring depressive symptoms ( p=0.01) and perceived stress ( p<0.01). Conclusions: Women ambivalent toward pregnancy are not only less likely to use contraception but also more likely to have unhealthy behaviors and psychological risk factors. As this combination of characteristics may put a future pregnancy and child at risk, awareness about the possible consequences of pregnancy ambivalence needs to increase among the public and medical community. Providers need to focus efforts on screening for this patient population and preventive education through contraceptive counseling.

T2  - Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adopted children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from the general ASD population in terms of diagnosis, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, and medications. METHODS: We studied 163 adoptees in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in comparison with 5624 nonadopted ATN participants (aged 1.5-17.6 years; mean [SD] = 6.2 [3.4] years). Gender, age, race, ethnicity, IQ, and categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, ASD diagnosis were tested for differences by group (adopted versus nonadopted) by using independent-samples t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic or linear regression models were used to examine the association between adoption status and several outcome variables, after controlling for covariates. RESULTS: After controlling for demographics and diagnosis, there were significant differences in group characteristics, including greater propensity for externalizing behavior (P < .001), internalizing behavior (P = .001), and sleep problems (P < .001) in the adopted population. Adoptees were also prescribed psychotropic medications (P < .001) more often than the nonadoptees. Adoptees received a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder--not otherwise specified significantly more frequently than controls (odds ratio = 1.8; CI = 1.3-2.5; P < .001), despite no significant difference in symptoms on standardized measures. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the population of adopted children with ASD differs from the general ASD population both with regard to diagnostic subtype and co-occurring behavioral problems. Future research should evaluate the contributions of specific factors associated with adoption such as biological family history, pregnancy history, early childhood experience, and age at adoption.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes the patterns of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms in a sample of childbearing women from the third trimester through the postpartum period. The relationship between sleep and depressive symptoms is also examined. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of sleep and depressive symptoms between women with depressive symptoms in comparison with women with minimal or no depressive symptoms in the third trimester and in the third month postpartum. METHODS: This longitudinal, descriptive study followed 124 primiparous women from their last month of pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. Questionnaires on sleep and depressive symptoms were completed during the third trimester (Time 1), 1 month postpartum (Time 2), 2 months postpartum (Time 3), and during the third month postpartum (Time 4). Sleep measures in a subset of women with depressive symptoms were compared with those of women with minimal or no symptoms at Time 1 and Time 4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were associated at Time 1 and Time 4. For new mothers, a complaint of trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep onset latency) may be the most relevant screening question in relation to their risk for postpartum depression.

TI  - Pelvic girdle pain - part 2: qualitative results from a mixed-methods service evaluation; women's experience of manual therapy treatment during pregnancy.
AU  - Monaghan, C.

T2  - Journal of Pelvic, Obstetric & Gynaecological Physiotherapy
AB  - Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is a musculoskeletal condition that affects 20% of gravid women. Pelvic girdle pain can have a marked impact on an individual's quality of life, sleep and functional activities, and can result in absenteeism from work. Part 1 of this paper presented the quantitative results of a mixed-methods service evaluation of the introduction of a manual therapy approach to usual care. There is a paucity of literature on patients' experience of receiving manual therapy for PGP during pregnancy. Therefore, the second aim of the service evaluation was to gain an insight into women's experiences of manual therapy treatment for PGP. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with seven women who had received manual therapy, and thematic framework analysis was applied to the data. Qualitative analysis revealed five distinct themes: living with PGP; practicalities of entering the physiotherapy system; patient expectation pre-treatment; response to manual therapy; and relationship with physiotherapist. Overall, women reported reduced pain and improved function after receiving manual therapy alongside usual care.

AB  - Objectives To assess the associations of perceived financial satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive symptoms in an unselected pregnant population in early pregnancy. Methods 750 consecutive pregnant women attending the first communal ultrasound examination before gestational week 14 were invited to participate. Questionnaires assessing HRQoL (15D), depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale, EPDS), medical, obstetric, and socioeconomic status were handed out. The participants were divided into three groups according to their satisfaction with their financial status, (unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, and satisfied). Main outcome measures were 15D and EPDS-scores and dimensions of HRQoL. Results 325 (43,3%) questionnaires were returned. The mean 15D-score for HRQoL was 0,926 (SD 0,056). The financially unsatisfied women had lower HRQoL than women in more satisfied groups (0.906, 0.923 and 0.931, p = 0.012). The result remained significant, even after adjusting for age and education(p = 0.032). The unsatisfied women had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (25.4, 24.4 and 23.2 kg/m, p for linearity = 0.002), were more often smokers, (13 vs. 4 and 3%, p = 0.029), and had experienced at least one abortion (18, 14 and 7%, p = 0.017). Dimensions of depression, distress and sleep explained the differences between the groups. 27% of unsatisfied women scored EPDS ≥10 points suggesting increased risk of depression. Conclusions Financial satisfaction in early pregnancy associates with HRQoL and risk of perinatal depressive symptoms. Unsatisfied women more often have risk factors for unfavourable pregnancy outcomes which may influence the later health and wellbeing of the mother and child.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes and less mental well-being. In pregnant women with a mental disorder, who frequently suffer from sleep problems, it is unknown whether predominantly objective or subjective sleep quality is more affected. To clarify this, we compared objective and subjective parameters of sleep quality between patients and healthy controls during pregnancy. METHODS: This observational study was embedded in an ongoing study among pregnant women with a mental disorder at the department of Psychiatry of Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We compared 21 pregnant women with a confirmed mental disorder with 33 healthy controls (gestational age, 23-29 weeks). To measure objective parameters of sleep quality, all participants continuously wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days and nights. Subjective sleep quality was retrospectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and on a daily basis with the Subjective Sleep Quality-scale (SSQ). Differences in parameters of sleep between patients and controls were tested using a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for parity, gestational age, educational level, and employment status. RESULTS: Objective parameters of sleep quality and subjective sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Daily sleep reports showed that, relative to controls, patients had a significantly worse average SSQ-score (5.2 vs. 7.6, adjusted [beta] = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.03-0.53, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory study suggests that perceived sleep quality reported on a daily basis by pregnant women with a mental disorder is worse than the sleep quality as measured by wrist actigraphy.

AB  - Background: In low-resource settings, a significant proportion of fetal, neonatal, and maternal deaths can be attributed to intrapartum-related complications. Certain risk factors, such as non-cephalic presentation, have a particularly high risk of complications. This qualitative study describes experiences around non-cephalic births and highlights existing perceptions and care-seeking behavior specific to non-cephalic presentation in rural Sarlahi District, Nepal.Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 34 individuals, including women who recently gave birth to a non-cephalic infant and female decision-makers in their households. We also conducted two focus groups with mothers (have two or more children, with at least one child under age five) and two focus groups with grandmothers in the community.Results: Several women described scenes of obstructed labor and practices like provision of unspecified injections early in labor to assist with the delivery. There were reports of arduous care-seeking processes from primary health centers to tertiary facilities, and mixed quality of care among home birth attendants and facility-based health workers respectively. Very few women were aware of the fetal presentation prior to delivery, and we identified no consistent understanding among participants of the risks of and care strategies for non-cephalic births. Risk perception around non-cephalic presentation varied widely. Some participants were acutely aware of potential dangers, while others had not heard of non-cephalic birth. Many interviewees said that the position in which a pregnant woman sleeps could impact the fetal position. Several participants had either taken or heard of medication intended to rotate the fetus into the correct position.Conclusions: Our findings suggest the mixed quality of and access to care associated with non-cephalic birth and a lack of consistent understanding of the risk of and care for non-cephalic births in rural Nepal. The high risk of the condition and the recommended tertiary care present a dilemma in low-resource settings; the logistical difficulties and the mixed quality of care make care-seeking and referral decisions complex. While public health stakeholders strive to improve the quality of and access to the formal health system, those players must also be sensitive to the potential negative implications of promoting institutional care-seeking.

AB  - Depression affects up to 23% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse physical/mental health outcomes for both the mother and baby. Depressed pregnant women may be more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to an increased risk for chronic disease. Little is known regarding depressed pregnant women’s perceptions, uses of, and interests in complementary health approaches. Study participants (mean age 28.7 ± 6.8; n = 1032) included pregnant women ≥8 weeks gestation who responded to a survey assessing physical and mental health and wellness practices. Of those completing the survey, depressed pregnant women (n = 272) had significantly higher levels of anxiety (P < .001) and stress (P < .001) and had poorer sleep quality (P < .001), mindfulness (P < .001), and social support (P < .001) compared to nondepressed pregnant women (n = 760). A majority (84%) of depressed pregnant women would consider using a complementary health approach for weight and/or stress management during pregnancy, and more than 50% were interested in yoga.

AU  - Grant, Paul

T2  - Practical Diabetes
AB  - Having the right care is essential for the wellbeing of all people with diabetes. There is a minimum level of health care that every person with diabetes should expect. In 2010, Diabetes UK produced a list of 15 essential checks and services that people with diabetes should expect to receive. We wanted to assess whether we were adequately achieving all of these targets in our own diabetes service and assess whether the targets were themselves adequate and appropriate. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 200 randomly selected patients attending the diabetes review clinic in a district general hospital. We recorded whether the parameters outlined in the Diabetes UK '15 health care essentials' had been achieved in the last 12 months and then collated the data. The data showed that we scored well in terms of monitoring HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index, retinal screening and cholesterol. However, we scored sub-optimally in terms of the following parameters: smoking cessation, pregnancy planning, structured education, measurement of waist circumference and psychological assessment. In conclusion, the Diabetes UK 'essentials' checklist may be viewed as mechanistic, but it provides a useful starting point to assess the effectiveness of a diabetes service in providing the basics of patient care in much the same way as the WHO surgical checklist reduces adverse outcomes. We have been able to see where the deficiencies in our own service lie and have made amends to ensure that these areas are covered in future. One issue that arose is that there are certain other 'essentials' that would be good to include in such a checklist, such as: erectile dysfunction (as suggested by the NICE guidelines), obstructive sleep apnoea, vitamin D deficiency, neuropathy screening and monitoring of liver function to rule out incipient steatohepatitis/fatty liver disease.

AB  - This review aims to evaluate the performance of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening questionnaires during pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using MEDLINE Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. A bivariate meta-analysis was applied for pooling of diagnostic parameters. Six of the total 4719 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ, N = 604) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, N = 420) were the most frequently used screening tools during pregnancy. The pooled prevalence of OSA during pregnancy was 26.7% (95%CI: 16.9%, 34.4%, I2 = 83.15%). BQ performance was poor to fair with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.45, 0.83; I2 = 78.65%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I2 = 81.55%), respectively. BQ performance was heterogeneous depending on type of reference test and pregnancy. Sensitivity increased if diagnosis was based on polysomnography (0.90), and respiratory disturbance index (0.90). However, sensitivity decreased if screening was performed in early pregnancy (≤20 weeks gestation: 0.47), and high-risk pregnancy (0.44). Performance of ESS was poor with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.33, 0.56; I2 = 32.8%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I2 = 81.55%), respectively. In conclusion, BQ and ESS showed poor performance during pregnancy, hence a new OSA screening questionnaire is needed. Registration: PROSPERO registration CRD42015025848.

T2  - Canadian Journal of Public Health
AB  - Background: This study assessed potential early-life factors and their interrelationships with obesity among young Canadian children.Methods: Data from a nationally representative sample of children aged 6 to 11 years in the Canadian Health Measures Survey were analyzed. The associations of perinatal and early childhood behaviours and socio-economic factors with overweight or obesity were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Adjusted population attributable risk fractions (PARFs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models.Results: Of 968 term-born children, 21% were overweight and another 13% were obese. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.15) was positively associated with obesity. This association was mediated by birth weight (suppression effect); once controlled, the strength of the association between smoking and child obesity increased by 12%. Birth weight per 100 g (1.05; 1.005-1.09) was significantly associated with obesity. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (0.44; 0.31-0.61), adequate sleep hours (0.39; 0.16-0.94) and being physically active (0.50; 0.26-0.93) were found to be protective. Breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, significantly reduced obesity risk among children whose mothers never smoked in pregnancy. PARFs indicated that 24.4%, 11.5%, 11.3% and 6.0% prevalent cases of child obesity might be prevented by exclusive breastfeeding, smoking cessation during pregnancy, adequate sleep during childhood, and avoiding high birth weight, respectively.Conclusions: This study identified multiple perinatal and childhood factors associated with obesity in young Canadian children. Effective prevention strategies targeting four modifiable maternal and child risk factors may reduce childhood obesity by up to 54% in Canada.

TI  - Perinatal Health Education Intervention for Adolescent and Young Adult Pregnant Homeless Women Living in Transitional Housing, and Best Practice Teaching Intervention Program for Staff Responsible for Care of the Mother-Baby Dyad.
AU  - Carrington, Colleen
T2  - Perinatal Health Education Intervention for Adolescent & Young Adult Pregnant Homeless Women Living in Transitional Housing & Best Practice Teaching Intervention Program For Staff Responsible For Care of the Mother-Baby Dyad
AB  - Purpose: A population at great risk is pregnant homeless adolescents and young adult women. Research shows that about 20% of homeless young women become pregnant (Bender, & Thompson, 2007). These pregnant young women are at an increased risk for low birth weight infants and a high infant mortality due to inadequate health care, poor dietary habits, and a knowledge deficit related to maintaining good health during pregnancy and to care of the infant and growing child. A transitional shelter may offer many psychosocial services to assist the women in becoming independent; however, a significant gap exists regarding the medical care of this population. The purpose of this DNP Project was to develop an educational program in a transitional homeless shelter focused on the health care of the pregnant woman and the newborn infant in order to bring awareness of the special needs of this high risk population and to attempt to change unhealthy behaviors. This program was coupled with an In- Service Program for staff members related to Best Practices for the Mother- Infant Dyad. Significance of the project: Knowledge can be empowering and save lives. Through months of interaction and time spent with new mothers in a transitional shelter, the enormous lack of evidence based practices in regards to infant and child care has become evident. This vulnerable population has the highest rate of infant mortality. Education can improve the health outcomes of these women and children. These mothers are eager to learn and want to give their children a chance for a healthy life. They are lacking the information to do so. Methods: The project was implemented in a transitional homeless shelter for women ages 18 to 23 based on a needs assessment. The project implementation contained two parts. Informal education sessions took place with pregnant women and women having recently given birth. 10 Education Intervention Program There were both individual and group sessions. The topics included labor and delivery preparation, diet during pregnancy, care of the newborn, and safety issues related to sleep and feedings. As the infants have grown over the months the sessions have evolved to meet the needs of the growing infant and child. The second part of the project contains a series of learning modules comprising of four hours of narrated lectures and power point presentations developed for the staff. Project Outcomes: The project initiatives were received by all involved wholeheartedly. The project brought to the shelter directors and staff members a new awareness of the crucial need for evidenced based practice in the care of the newborn and mother. Clinical observations have shown a readiness for several of the mothers to follow lessons learned. Significant changes in behaviors related to care of the infant have been observed. A level of trust has developed between the educator and the residents of the shelter. The educator has assumed the role of advocate and mentor. Clinical Relevance: Women head up 90 percent of the families that use shelters. A third of the homeless are women and children, and the numbers are exploding. Through education, advocacy and developing a means of quality health care the lives of these women and children will be made better and healthier. A best practice model for care of the pregnant homeless women and her infant is needed.

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: Both perinatal depression and infant sleep problems are common concerns in many communities, with these problems often coinciding. Findings in this area conflict and much of the research relies on poor measures of sleep and/or depression. Adding to this complexity is the rise in antidepressant treatment for perinatal maternal depression and no previous study has examined the relationship between such exposure and infant sleep.Methods: This study draws on four waves of data (early pregnancy and third trimester, and six and 12 months postpartum) from 264 women in the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort study of women recruited in early pregnancy in Melbourne, Australia. Cross-lagged regression models were used to examine reciprocity of longitudinal effects between depressive symptoms and infant sleep.Results: Maternal antepartum depression and antidepressant use were not significant predictors of infant sleep problems. Likewise, infant sleep problems were not significant predictors of postpartum maternal depression. However, maternal cognitions about infant sleep, characterised by maternal expectations to immediately attend to their crying child, did demonstrate positive reciprocal effects with infant nocturnal waking between six and 12 months postpartum.Limitations: Infant sleep outcomes were reported by the mother and the sample were predominantly Anglophone, restricting generalizability of the models to other cultures.Conclusions: Maternal depression and antidepressant use were not found to be significant factors in infant sleep problems and, likewise, infant sleep problems were not associated with maternal depression. However, postpartum maternal cognitions around six months postpartum regarding limit-setting at night may predict increases in later nocturnal infant signaling.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and maternal and neonatal morbidities in a cohort of obese gravid women.Methods: Participants were enrolled in a prospective observational study designed to screen for OSA and describe the possible risk factors for and outcomes of OSA among obese (body mass index [BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]2] 30 or higher) pregnant women. Women underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor. Studies were manually scored by a central masked sleep reading center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. An apnea hypopnea index of 5 or more was considered diagnostic of OSA. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women with and without OSA.Results: Among 175 women, OSA prevalence was 15.4% (13 mild, 9 moderate, 5 severe). Compared with no OSA (apnea hypopnea index less than 5), the OSA group had a higher BMI (46.8±12.2 compared with 38.1±7.5; P=.002) and more chronic hypertension (55.6% compared with 32.4%, P=.02). Maternal complications included maternal death (n=1, amniotic fluid embolus [no OSA group]) and cardiac arrest (n=1, intraoperative at cesarean delivery [OSA group]). One previable birth and two stillbirths occurred in the no OSA group. Among live births, OSA was associated with more frequent cesarean delivery (65.4% compared with 32.8%; P=.003), preeclampsia (42.3% compared with 16.9%; P=.005), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (46.1% compared with 17.8%; P=.002). After controlling for BMI, maternal age, and diabetes, OSA (odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-11.3), previous preeclampsia (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.09-7.19), and hypertension (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.67-10.77) were associated with development of preeclampsia.Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea among obese pregnant women is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and cesarean delivery.Level Of Evidence: II.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether specific perinatal factors are associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. All cases of OSAS were obtained from a tertiary pediatric hospital between April 2013 and April 2016. A total of 823 children who had been diagnosed with OSAS were designated as the case group, and 823 children without OSAS were selected with strict criteria to match with the case group by age, gender and body mass index. Logistic regression models were used to determine the perinatal factors associated with childhood OSAS.Results: Preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-3.08) and cesarean section (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.68) were significantly associated with OSAS. Exposure of the mother to smoke (aOR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.57-4.26) was also associated with an increased risk of childhood OSAS. Mothers aged 35 years and above, performing manual labor, and living in suburban areas significantly increased the risk of childhood OSAS. Multiparous mothers decreased the risk of childhood OSAS (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42-0.83). Maternal education, gravidity, prenatal care times, pregnancy-induced hypertension, multiple pregnancies, sex of the child and birth weight were not significantly associated with OSAS in children.Conclusion: Perinatal risk factors are important for predicting childhood OSAS. Our findings provide evidence regarding several potentially useful factors for recognizing OSAS in children, which could be important in diagnosis of pediatric OSAS by physicians.

AB  - The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is unknown during pregnancy, but the syndrome is likely underdiagnosed and rising in frequency along with the obesity epidemic. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse outcomes, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm, and cesarean delivery. Obese pregnant women should be screened and referred to a sleep medicine specialist for evaluation. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice with demonstrated safety and compliance in pregnancy. Early anesthesia consultation allows for preparation and implementation of a peripartum plan that includes early labor analgesia, avoidance of respiratory depressants, and closer monitoring of oxygenation.

T2  - International Journal of Nursing Studies
AB  - Background Daytime sleepiness is a frequent complaint in women during pregnancy. It has also been linked to negative obstetric consequences. Although high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness throughout pregnancy is well-documented, neither the causes of persistent daytime sleepiness nor new-onset daytime sleepiness during pregnancy have been investigated. Identifying predictive factors may play an important role in the management of daytime sleepiness in pregnant women and improve prenatal care and maternal-fetal outcomes. Objectives To examine first-trimester maternal characteristics associated with the persistence and new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Design A longitudinal, prospective cohort design. Setting One medical center in Taipei, Taiwan and participating women’s homes. Participants A total of 204 pregnant women. Methods First-trimester pregnant women recruited from an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center provided socio-demographic and health information, wore an actigraphy monitor for 7 days, and completed sleep, mood, and daytime sleepiness questionnaires. Data were collected again when the women were in the second and third trimester. Results Thirty-one (15.2%) women experienced excessive daytime sleepiness that persisted across all three trimesters. Nulliparous women and women who snored in the first trimester were 2.28 and 2.10 times more at risk of being classified of persistent daytime sleepiness than multiparous women and women who did not snore in the first trimester, respectively. Thirty-one (15.2%) women developed new-onset daytime sleepiness with advancing gestation. Women were more likely to develop new-onset daytime sleepiness if they worked longer hours per week (OR = 1.04, p < 0.001), if they reported snoring (OR = 6.75, p < 0.001), and if they had elevated depressive symptoms in the first trimester of pregnancy (OR = 1.09, p = 0.01). Conclusions Snoring in the first trimester is involved in both the persistence and new-onset of daytime sleepiness with elevated depressive symptoms related to new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Findings suggest that intervention strategies for alleviating daytime sleepiness in pregnant women should focus on managing snoring and symptoms of depression in early trimesters with special attention to nulliparous and employed women.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - It was recently reported that pregnant women were more likely to have minor depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression scale (PHQ-8), (as reported by Kroenke and Spitzer (Psychiatr Ann 32(9):1-7, 2002), and Kroenke et al. (J Affect 114(1-3):163-173, 2009)) compared to women who were not pregnant (as reported by Ashley et al. (Arch Womens Ment Health 19(2):395-400, 2015)). The present study is designed to investigate if somatic symptoms (energy level, appetite, sleep) associated with both pregnancy and depression were responsible for this increased prevalence of minor depression. A sample of pregnant women ( n = 404) was compared to women who were not pregnant ( n = 6754). Both groups scored within the minor depression range on the PHQ-8 and comparisons were based on participants' responses to PHQ-8 items. Results indicate that of the somatic symptoms of depression, only changes in energy level accounted for the elevated prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant. Removing the decreased energy item from the score determination reduces the prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women to a level significantly below that of women who are not pregnant. Emotional symptoms such as feeling down and feeling like a failure were less likely to be reported by pregnant women compared to women who were not pregnant. Implications for depression screening during pregnancy are discussed.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of physical activity before and during pregnancy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data from the cluster-randomised gestational diabetes mellitus primary prevention trial conducted in maternity clinics were utilised in a secondary analysis. The cases considered were pregnant women who reported engaging in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity per week (active women) ( N = 80), and the controls were women below these recommendations (less active) ( N = 258). All participants had at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Their HRQoL was evaluated via the validated generic instrument 15D, with HRQoL at the end of pregnancy examined in relation to changes in physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression models addressed age, parity, education, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. At the end of pregnancy, the expected HRQoL was higher (tobit regression coefficient 0.022, 95 % CI 0.003-0.042) among active women than less active women. Active women also had greater mobility (OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.04-3.78), ability to handle their usual activities (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.29-3.81), and vitality (OR 2.08, 95 % CI 1.22-3.54) than did less active women. Active women reported higher-quality sleep (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.03-4.30) throughout pregnancy as compared to less active women. Meeting of the physical activity guidelines before pregnancy was associated with better overall HRQoL and components thereof related to physical activity.

AB  - Background: Detailed associations between physical activity (PA) subcomponents, sedentary time, and body composition in preschoolers remain unclear. Objective: We examined the magnitude of associations between objectively measured PA subcomponents and sedentary time with body composition in 4-y-old children. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 398 preschool children recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey. PA was measured by using accelerometry, and body composition was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between light physical activity, moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intensity; sedentary time; and body composition were analyzed by using repeated-measures linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, birth weight, maternal education, maternal BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and sleep duration. Sedentary time and PA were also mutually adjusted for one another to determine whether they were independently related to adiposity. Results: VPA was the only intensity of PA to exhibit strong inverse associations with both total adiposity [P < 0.001 for percentage of body fat and fat mass index (FMI)] and abdominal adiposity (P = 0.002 for trunk FMI). MVPA was inversely associated with total adiposity (P = 0.018 for percentage of body fat; P = 0.022 for FMI) but only because of the contribution of VPA, because MPA was unrelated to fatness (P ≥ 0.077). No associations were shown between-the lime spent sedentary and body composition (P ≥ 0.11). Conclusions: In preschoolers, the time spent in VPA is strongly and independently associated with lower adiposity. In contrast, the time spent sedentary and in low-to-moderate-intensity PA was unrelated to adiposity. These results indicate that efforts to challenge pediatric obesity may benefit from prioritizing VPA.

AB  - Background: Physiological structure and hormonal changes in women during pregnancy may alter physical activity behavior and sleep quality, both of which are factors that influence the method of fetal delivery. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the relationships between physical activity, sleep quality, and unplanned cesarean section. Methods: This study employed a prospective and descriptive correlational design. A total of 184 pregnant women in their third trimester at 2 medical centers participated in the study. A 3-day physical activity scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to evaluate, respectively, physical activity-related energy expenditures and sleep quality. Results: Subjects had a comparatively low level of energy expenditure on physical activity and performed a lower than normal amount of moderate-to-heavy physical activity. Three-quarters (77.2%) of subjects had poor sleep quality, and 40.7% reported being unsatisfied with their sleep quality. The main cause of poor sleep quality was sleep disturbance. Using logistic regression, results indicated that the odds of undergoing cesarean section increased to 1.22 (95% CI =1.01 -- 1.48) when sleep quality was 'poor'. By contrast, odds decreased to 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 -- 0.97) when physical activity energy expenditures rose. Conclusions / Implications for practice: Results support the need to obtain physical activity and sleep quality data on women during pregnancy. Appropriate assistance and health education are important during perinatal care to reduce the incidence of unplanned cesarean sections.

AB  - Aims: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with placenta-mediated adverse clinical outcomes. We aimed at comparing placenta-secreted proteins, such as first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers which have been linked to preeclampsia, and markers of angiogenesis in pregnant women with OSA, and pregnant controls at low risk for OSA. Methods: A case-control study of pregnant women with OSA and controls at low risk for OSA was performed. Levels of first and second trimester markers were reported as multiple of median (MoM), and adjusted for body mass index (BMI). Stored samples were tested for markers of angiogenesis and adjusted for gestational age, BMI, and chronic hypertension. Results: A total of 24 women with OSA and 166 controls had screening markers. BMI was higher in cases compared to controls, P=0.01. MoM levels of placenta associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) were significantly lower in cases versus controls, even after adjusting for BMI (0.52 IQR 0.48 vs. 1.01 IQR 0.63, P=0.009). The ratio of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 to placental growth factor was significantly higher in cases than controls, even after adjusting for confounders (4.42 IQR 2.52 vs. 2.93 IQR 2.01, P=0.009). Conclusion: Circulating placenta-secreted glycoproteins and markers of angiogenesis are altered in pregnant women with OSA.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that disturbances in levels of plasma melatonin differentiate pregnant and postpartum women with major depression from matched pregnant and postpartum healthy comparison women.Method: Participants were 25 pregnant women (10 with major depression, 15 healthy) and 24 postpartum women (13 with major depression, 11 healthy). Healthy comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum. Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. The values of plasma melatonin levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding status, and body mass index as covariates.Results: Morning melatonin levels from 2:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women.Conclusions: Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours, were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of depression. These findings implicate disturbances in the regulation of the melatonin generating system in pregnancy and postpartum depression.

AB  - Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) deficiency, poor sleep quality, and night-time eating, have been independently associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but their inter-relationships are yet to be evaluated. We aimed to investigate the associations between maternal plasma 25OHD status and sleep quality and circadian eating patterns during pregnancy. Data on pregnant women (n = 890) from a prospective cohort (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes) were analyzed. Plasma 25OHD concentration was measured, while the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and 24-h dietary recall were administered to women at 26-28 weeks' gestation. Plasma 25OHD status was defined as sufficient (>75 nmol/L), insufficient (50-75 nmol/L), or deficient (<50 nmol/L). Poor sleep quality was defined by a total global PSQI score >5. Predominantly day-time (pDT) and predominantly night-time (pNT) were defined according to consumption of greater proportion of calories (i.e., >50%) from 07:00-18:59 and from 19:00-06:59, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, women with plasma 25OHD deficiency had higher odds of poor sleep quality (odds ratio (OR) 3.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84-6.63) and pNT eating (OR: 1.85; 95% CI 1.00-3.41) than those who were 25OHD sufficient. Our findings show the association of maternal plasma 25OHD deficiency with poor sleep quality and pNT eating at mid-pregnancy.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of an intervention for polydrug-using adolescent mothers. The program included educational, vocational, and parenting classes; social and drug rehab; and day care for their infants while they attended school half-day. The drug-exposed infants were similar to the nonexposed infants on traditional birth measures, although they had inferior Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale scores, including habituation, orientation, abnormal reflexes, general irritability, and regulatory capacity. The drug-exposed infants also spent less time in quiet sleep and more time crying and showing stress behaviors. Both the mothers and the infants in the drug groups demonstrated inferior interactions, and their dopamine and serotonin levels were significantly higher. As early as 3 months (following 3 months of intervention), the drug rehab mothers and their infants looked more like the nondrug group in their interactions; by 6 months, they looked similar on virtually every measure. At 12 months, the infants of drug rehab mothers (versus the drug control group) had superior Early Social Communication Scale scores and Bayley Mental scale scores, as well as significantly greater head circumference and fewer pediatric complications. The drug rehab mothers also improved on several lifestyle variables. They demonstrated a lower incidence of continued drug use and repeat pregnancy, and a greater number continued school, received a high school or general equivalency diploma, or were placed in a job. Thus, a relatively cost-effective high school based intervention had positive effects on both adolescent mothers who had used drugs and their infants.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the relationship between poor sleep quality during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Methods: A total of 4066 singleton pregnant women from the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort (TMCHC) without overt diabetes before pregnancy were analyzed. Sleep quality and duration during early pregnancy were self-reported by enrolled women at their first antenatal care visit before 16 weeks of gestation. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was assessed with a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Information about self-reported sleep quality and duration in mid-pregnancy were also collected at this time. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated by multivariable logistic regression models, and adjusted for potential confounders to estimate the effect of poor sleep quality and the interaction between sleep quality and duration on the development of GDM. Stratified analyses were performed according to age, parity, family history of diabetes and napping.Results: A total of 335 (8.2%) participants were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality was reported in 259 (6.4%) women during early pregnancy and 248 (6.1%) in mid-pregnancy. The risk of GDM was increased in women with poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20-2.61). No association was found between poor sleep quality during mid-pregnancy and the risk of GDM. The risk of GDM was highest in women with poor sleep and longer nighttime sleep duration during early pregnancy (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.20-4.29) when compared with those who reported good sleep and 7.0-8.5 h of sleep duration per night. Stratified analysis found that the association between poor sleep quality in early pregnancy and the risk of GDM was stronger among women aged ≥30 years (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.35-4.09) and those with a family history of diabetes (OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.54-10.48).Conclusions: Poor sleep quality during early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of GDM. Screening for and treating sleep problems in early pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk of GDM.

AB  - Women are at increased risk of developing mood disorders during the postpartum period, and poor postpartum sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of depression. This longitudinal study investigated the relationship between sleep variables and postpartum depression symptoms using wrist actigraphy and self-report surveys. Twenty-five healthy primiparous women were recruited from their outpatient obstetricians’ offices from July 2009 through March 2010. Subjects wore wrist actigraphs for 1 week during the third trimester of pregnancy and again during the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th weeks postpartum while completing sleep logs and sleep surveys. Subjective assessments of mood were collected at the end of each actigraph week. Subjective sleep assessments were strongly predictive of depression severity scores as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) across all weeks ( p < 0.001). Actigraphic measures of sleep maintenance, such as sleep fragmentation, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset, were also significantly correlated with EPDS scores postpartum. However, there was no relationship between nocturnal sleep duration and EPDS scores. This study provides additional evidence that poor sleep maintenance as measured by wrist actigraphy, rather than lesser amounts of sleep, is associated with EPDS scores during the postpartum period and that subjective assessments of sleep may be more accurate predictors of postpartum depression symptoms than wrist actigraphy. It also supports the hypothesis that disrupted sleep may contribute to the development and extent of postpartum depression symptoms.

AB  - Study Objectives: Poor sleep promotes inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the United States, a persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans showing ∼1.5 times greater risk. This study examined associations among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women.Design: Observational.Measurements: Women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other psychosocial and behavioral measures during midpregnancy. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined by high-sensitivity assays. Birth outcomes were determined via medical record review.Results: Among African American women (n = 79), shorter gestation was predicted by poorer overall sleep (rs = -0.35, P = 0.002) as well the following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (rs = -0.34, P = 0.002), sleep latency (rs = -0.27, P = 0.02), and sleep efficiency (rs = -0.27, P = 0.02). African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 10.2 times the odds of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among European American women (n = 53), gestational length was not significantly predicted by sleep quality (Ps > 0.12). Bootstrapping analyses showed that, among African Americans, IL-8 significantly mediated the association between sleep quality and length of gestation (indirect effect estimate -0.029; 95% confidence interval -0.06, -0.002).Conclusions: The data provide novel evidence that African American women exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep disturbance than European American women and these effects correspond with length of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep induced immune dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth.

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and symptoms of depression and anxiety in women studied in pregnancy and postpartum. Scores on standardized measures of sleep (PSQI) at 6 months postpartum, and symptoms of anxiety and depression (OASIS, the PHQ9, and EPDS) were assessed by structured interviews in 116 women in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women who had significantly higher OASIS (anxiety) scores (β = .530, p < .001), PHQ9 (depression) scores (β = .496, p < .001), and EPDS (postpartum depression and anxiety) scores (β = .585, p < .001) also had elevated total PSQI scores after adjustment for covariates, including prenatal depression and anxiety scores. Though inferences about causality are not feasible, these results support emerging research showing sleep quality is a risk factor for negative maternal affect in the postpartum period. Assessment of maternal sleep hygiene is worth consideration as a component of identifying women at risk for postpartum depression and anxiety.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health priority and the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Several risk factors have been identified, but a gap in the understanding of the underlying etiology of PTB persists. Poor sleep quality is a correlate of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated whether sleep quality during pregnancy was a clinically relevant risk factor for PTB. DESIGN: Observational MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Participants included 166 pregnant women (mean age = 28.6 ± 5.5 years). Self-report questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% CI [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% CI [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07). With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25% in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality, in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed sleep contributes to PTB are unknown. We suggest that poor sleep may contribute to increased risk for PTB both independently, as well as in conjunction with other established risk factors, such as stress.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the independent and combined associations of maternal self-reported poor sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation during the third trimester METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1298 pregnant women (between 24 and 28 gestational weeks) attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Multivariate logistical regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) after adjusting for putative confounders.Results: Approximately, 17% of women were classified as having poor sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of >5 vs. ≤5). Further, the prevalence of antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively in this cohort. After adjusting for confounders including depression, poor sleep quality was associated with a 2.81-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR=2.81; 95% CI 1.78-4.45). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 28% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (OR=1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.41). The odds of suicidal ideation was particularly high among depressed women with poor sleep quality (OR=13.56 95% CI 7.53-24.41) as compared with women without either risk factor.Limitations: This cross-sectional study utilized self-reported data. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may not be fully generalizable.Conclusion: Poor sleep quality, even after adjusting for depression, is associated with antepartum suicidal ideation. Our findings support the need to explore sleep-focused interventions for pregnant women.

TI  - Postnatal depression and post traumatic stress disorder: what are the links?
AU  - Creedy D
T2  - Birth Issues
AB  - Aim: The term 'postnatal depression' conveys the notion of a homogenous disorder, which can be investigated and treated as if it had a single cause. This paper argues that adverse events during childbirth can act as powerful triggers in the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subsequently, postnatal depression. Drawing on the qualitative data gathered during a mixed method, longitudinal prospective study with childbearing women (n = 499), three case studies are used to illustrate trauma responses to stressful childbirth experiences. Results: Childbirth events involving life threat and personal injury were found to give rise to trauma reactions. Responses included the re-experiencing of the trauma commonly through intrusive thoughts about the birth, avoidance of people, places and thoughts associated with the event, and physiological arousal symptoms that may contribute to sleep difficulties or somatic complaints. Furthermore, the women reported the early onset of trauma symptoms, avoiding contact with the baby, and the experience of depression. Conclusion: Trauma symptoms in the postpartum period may be missed and their relationship to maternal depression may be overlooked. Health professionals need to acknowledge the unique nature of childbirth for each woman and attend to the emotional aspects of care in order to minimize adverse psychosocial consequences.

T2  - Pediatric Research
AB  - Background: Approximately 1/3 of newborns exposed antenatally to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) exhibit poor neonatal adaptation. Although several potential mechanisms have been proposed, the actual mechanism has not been elucidated.Methods: We investigated outcomes in neonatal lambs exposed prenatally or postnatally to fluoxetine (FX). Daily FX injections (50 mg) were given intravenously (i.v.) to five pregnant ewes via implanted catheters beginning at 131-132 days gestation (term = 147 days) for 2 weeks. In another group, lambs with implanted vascular catheters had sterile water (n = 9) or FX (1 mg/kg, n = 12) injected i.v. on ~postnatal day (PND) 4.Results: Prenatal FX-exposed lambs (n = 7) were hyperactive during PND 4 to 14 and their heart rate variability (HRV) was significantly lower than in control lambs (n = 7) on PND 2. In contrast, arterial pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, arterial blood gases, pH, glucose, lactate, cortisol, and sleep-activity cycles were not altered following postnatal FX injection.Conclusion: This abnormal postnatal hyperactivity with antenatal FX exposure may reflect increased maturity in terms of locomotory activity. The results suggest that altered brain development may be involved in the poor neonatal adaptation in human infants exposed to FX in utero.

TI  - Postnatal parental education for optimizing infant general health and parent-infant relationships.
AU  - Bryanton J
AU  - Beck CT
T2  - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period, and it is important to examine interventions used to educate new parents about caring for their newborns during this time. The primary objective was to assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered to an individual or group related to infant general health or care and parent-infant relationships. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013). We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post-birth related to the health or care of an infant or parent-infant relationships. Two review authors (JB, CTB) assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports. Of the 27 trials (3949 mothers and 579 fathers) that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) reported useable data. Educational interventions included: five on infant sleep enhancement, 12 on infant behaviour, three on general post-birth health, three on general infant care, and four on infant safety. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only 13 were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these 13 meta-analyses, only four were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect. Education about sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more night-time minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours at six weeks of age (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. However, it had no significant effect on the mean difference in minutes of crying time in 24 hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age. Education related to infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91). The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear. Education related to sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep but appears to have no effect on infant crying time. Education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

TI  - Postpartum depression and sleep loss in first time mothers.
AU  - Goyal D
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe depressive symptoms and sleep in first-time mothers. Predictors of postpartum depressive symptoms, including perceived stress, social support, and maternal adjustment were also examined. Another purpose was to compare objective and subjective sleep in mothers with and without depressive symptoms in the third trimester (Time 1) and at 12 weeks postpartum (Time 2).This descriptive, correlational, longitudinal, secondary analysis utilized data from two randomized clinical trials. Depressive symptoms, psychosocial measures, and subjective and objective sleep measures were collected on a sample of 161 first-time mothers between the ages of 18 and 43 years.The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Mean CES-D scores at Time 1 (12.2 +/- 7.0) significantly improved at Time 2 (8.8 +/- 6.7). However, of the 46 women scoring in the depressed range at Time 1, 32.6% (n = 15) continued to experience depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Of the 115 women with minimal symptoms at Time 1, 7% (n = 8) experienced depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance were significantly associated at Time 1 and Time 2. Overall sleep disturbance, minutes to fall asleep, ability to stay asleep, and daytime sleepiness significantly improved from late pregnancy to 12 weeks postpartum. Women with depressive symptoms in the late third trimester and 12 weeks postpartum reported significantly more sleep disturbance, trouble falling asleep and more daytime sleepiness than women without depressive symptoms. Fifty-seven percent of the variance in mothers' depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum was explained by six independent variables. However, antenatal CES-D score alone was a significant predictor of postpartum depression scores, accounting for 16.7% of the variance in depression scores at 12 weeks postpartum.The results of this study underscore the need for health care providers to assess depressive symptoms and sleep during pregnancy and during the first few postpartum months. Furthermore, results suggest that complaints of sleep disturbance, especially prolonged sleep onset latency and increased daytime sleepiness, may be relevant screening questions in relation to risk for postpartum depression.

T2  - BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth
AB  - Background: Postpartum depression is a common condition, which consequences might be harmful for both mother and child. Since sleep and depression are closely related it is possible that women who suffer from sleep related problems during pregnancy are more likely to develop depression in the postpartum period. This study aims to investigate the possible association between depressive symptoms in the postpartum period and sleep related problems during pregnancy.Methods: In this study 293 women in the last trimester of pregnancy answered a questionnaire about symptoms of restless legs, snoring and daytime sleepiness. They also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The same women were screened for depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) four to ten weeks after giving birth. Additional information about social data, pregnancy and delivery was received from the medical charts.Results: Women with postpartum depressive symptoms had higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness defined as ESS score ≥10 (OR 3.84, CI 1.57-9.39), and restless legs syndrome (OR 2.837 CI 1.18-6.84) in last trimester of pregnancy, when adjusted for socio-demographic factors and obstetric risk factors. No association was found between postpartum depressive symptoms and snoring.Conclusions: Depressive symptoms after childbirth are preceded by sleep related problems such as daytime sleepiness and restless legs, already during pregnancy. The results from Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a questionnaire concerning Restless Legs Syndrome completed during pregnancy might be a valuable contribution for detecting women at risk for postpartum depression, enabling preventive interventions.

AB  - Background: Lack of physical activity and sleep can lead to serious health consequences. One population likely to experience both of these issues is postpartum mothers. Aim: To compare physical activity and sleep of overweight/obese and normal weight postpartum mothers. Methods: The study recruited 21 mothers in the first 6 months postpartum, who were classified as normal weight or overweight. Activity and sleep levels were gathered via wrist-worn accelerometers at three intervals between 3–6 months postpartum. Findings: Overall, there was a significant (<italic>P</italic><0.05) increase in physical activity. When separated by body mass index (BMI) classification, the ‘normal weight’ group displayed a significant increase in physical activity, while the ‘overweight/obese’ group did not. Normal-weight participants also had the larger increase in physical activity from visit two to three. All participants significantly decreased in sleep levels from visit two to three. Conclusions: Discrepancies appeared between the physical activity of overweight/obese and normal-weight mothers. Interventions before and after pregnancy may be key in improving these issues.

AB  - This study of mother-baby sleep patterns used an exploratory descriptive approach. The subjects were a sample of convenience of nine first time mothers and their baby. Data were collected by means of unstructured non-directive interviews and the Nursing Child Assessment Sleep Activity Record (NCASAR) during the second to fourth postpartum weeks. The findings showed that most of the mothers obtained as many hours of sleep in the postpartum period as they did prior to pregnancy. However, this sleep was subject to many interruptions. All of the subjects felt less rested and complained of tiredness which they ascribed to meeting the needs of their baby rather than with actual reduction in the number of sleep hours. The mothers described tiredness in two ways, physical and emotional. Support from partner and others was critical to the mothers in assisting them to adapt to and cope with the responsibilities of motherhood. The findings of this study confirmed the unpredictable nature of baby sleep-wake cycles during the early postpartum period.

AB  - Background: Obesity among children and adolescents is a growing public health problem. The aim of the present paper is to identify potential determinants of obesity and risk groups among 3- to 17-year old children and adolescents to provide a basis for effective prevention strategies.Methods: Data were collected in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), a nationally representative and comprehensive data set on health behaviour and health status of German children and adolescents. Body height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was classified according to IOTF cut-off points. Statistical analyses were conducted on 13,450 non-underweight children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years. The association between overweight, obesity and several potential determinants was analysed for this group as well as for three socio-economic status (SES) groups. A multiple logistic regression model with obesity as the dependent variable was also calculated.Results: The strongest association with obesity was observed for parental overweight and for low SES. Furthermore, a positive association with both overweight (including obesity) and obesity was seen for maternal smoking during pregnancy, high weight gain during pregnancy (only for mothers of normal weight), high birth weight, and high media consumption. In addition, high intakes of meat and sausages, total beverages, water and tea, total food and beverages, as well as energy-providing food and beverages were significantly associated with overweight as well as with obesity. Long sleep time was negatively associated with obesity among 3- to 10-year olds. Determinants of obesity occurred more often among children and adolescents with low SES.Conclusion: Parental overweight and a low SES are major potential determinants of obesity. Families with these characteristics should be focused on in obesity prevention.

AB  - Dopaminergic agents, particularly dopamine agonists, have been used with increasing frequency in the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder. These evidence-based practice parameters are complementary to the Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, published in 1999. These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of dopaminergic agents in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Levodopa with decarboxylase inhibitor, and the dopaminergic agonists pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Other dopamine agonists (talipexole, cabergoline, piribidel, and alpha-dihydroergocryptine) and the dopaminergic agents amantadine and selegiline may be effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD, but the level of effectiveness of these medications is not currently established. Lastly, no specific recommendations can be made regarding dopaminergic treatment of children or pregnant women with RLS or PLMD.

AB  - Aims: We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time.Methods: The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income, minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child age.Results: Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later.Conclusions: Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.

AB  - For more than two decades, prenatal care has been a cornerstone of our nation's strategy for improving pregnancy outcomes. In recent years, however, a growing recognition of the limits of prenatal care and the importance of maternal health before pregnancy has drawn increasing attention to preconception and internatal care. Internatal care refers to a package of healthcare and ancillary services provided to a woman and her family from the birth of one child to the birth of her next child. For healthy mothers, internatal care offers an opportunity for wellness promotion between pregnancies. For high-risk mothers, internatal care provides strategies for risk reduction before their next pregnancy. In this paper we begin to define the contents of internatal care. The core components of internatal care consist of risk assessment, health promotion, clinical and psychosocial interventions. We identified several priority areas, such as FINDS (family violence, infections, nutrition, depression, and stress) for risk assessment or BBEEFF (breastfeeding, back-to-sleep, exercise, exposures, family planning and folate) for health promotion. Women with chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or weight problems should receive on-going care per clinical guidelines for their evaluation, treatment, and follow-up during the internatal period. For women with prior adverse outcomes such as preterm delivery, we propose an internatal care model based on known etiologic pathways, with the goal of preventing recurrence by addressing these biobehavioral pathways prior to the next pregnancy. We suggest enhancing service integration for women and families, including possibly care coordination and home visitation for selected high-risk women. The primary aim of this paper is to start a dialogue on the content of internatal care.

T2  - Preventive Medicine
AB  - Preconception health refers to the health of males and females at any point in time prior to a potential pregnancy. A goal of preconception health research is to use preventive behaviour and healthcare to optimize the health of future offspring that result from both planned and unplanned pregnancies. This paper briefly reviews evidence of the importance of various preconception health behaviours, and examines the extent to which specific preconception health behaviours have been included in recent studies of such knowledge, behaviours, and intentions. To describe this recent research in highly developed countries, a scoping review of the literature was completed of studies published within the past seven years. A total of 94 studies on preconception health were identified and reviewed: (a) 15 examined knowledge and attitudes, (b) 68 studied behaviours, (c) 18 examined interventions designed to improve knowledge or behaviour, and (d) no studies examined intentions to engage in preconception health behaviours. Over 40% of studies examining preconception health behaviour focussed exclusively on folic acid. Overall, folic acid, alcohol, and cigarettes have consistently been topics of focus, while exposure to harmful environmental substances, stress, and sleep have been largely neglected. Despite strong evidence for the importance of men's health during the preconception period, only 11% of all studies included male participants. Based on existing gaps in the research, recommendations are provided, such as including men in future research, assessing a wider variety of behaviours, consideration of behavioural intentions, and consideration of the relationships between preconception health knowledge, intentions, and behaviour.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Given the increasing number of women service members and veterans of childbearing age, it is important to understand the preconception risks in this potentially vulnerable population. This study compared the prevalence of modifiable preconception risk factors among women with and without a history of service. Methods Analyses included data from the 2013 and 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Preconception risk factors included health behaviors, chronic conditions, and mental health among women of childbearing age. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to compare the adjusted prevalence of each outcome among women with and without a history of service. Interaction terms assessed variation by age and history of service. Results Compared with women without a history of service, women with a history of service reported higher prevalence of insufficient sleep (49.6% vs. 36.3%; p <.001) and diagnosed depression (26.5% vs. 21.6%; p <.01). Women with a history of service were overall less likely to have obesity (19.8% vs. 26.5%; p <.001). Age-stratified results suggested that, compared with women without a history of service, women with a history of service were more likely to smoke in the 25 to 34 age group and reported comparable levels of obesity in the 35 to 44 age group. Conclusions Women with a history of service demonstrated a preconception health profile that differs from women without a history of service. It is critical that providers are aware of their patients' military status and potential associated risks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to identify, as early as possible, infants who are at risk for long-term neurological morbidity. METHODS: To predict neurodevelopment outcome of preterm infants <30 weeks' gestation in a population of 100 infants, we used several neonatal and neurobehavioral tests, including cranial ultrasonography, the Prechtl neurological test, quality of spontaneous general movements, and quality of sleep-wake organization. RESULTS: The Prechtl test at corrected term age and findings on cranial sonograms both had high specificity, but the Prechtl test had better overall positive predictive power for normal neurological and developmental outcomes at 2 years' corrected age. Developmental changes in sleep and the amount of indeterminate sleep did not correlate with outcome. Scoring general movement quality did not predict outcome and did not augment the positive predictive power of the Prechtl test. CONCLUSIONS: The Prechtl test at corrected term age (independent of the other tests) is the best positive predictor of normal neurological outcome and Bayley test results at 2 years' corrected age.

T2  - Journal of Nursing Research (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)
AB  - Background: Antenatal stress has been associated with adverse outcomes in mothers and their children. However, little research has been conducted to identify the factors associated with psychosocial stress in pregnant women. Purpose: This study explored the predictors of psychosocial stress during pregnancy. Methods: A convenience sample of 136 second-trimester and 164 third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from a medical center in southern Taiwan. Data were collected using a demographic form, Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Maternal--Fetal Attachment Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List. Results: The results of this study found positive correlations between PSRS and both Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale (r = .368, p < .01) and MaternalYFetal Attachment Scale (r = .168, p < .01) and negative correlations between PSRS and both gravidity (r = -.137, p < .05) and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (r = -.266, p < .01). Higher pregnancy stress was predicted by depression, lower social support, maternal--fetal attachment, and primigravid status, which together explained 20% of the total variance. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Depression, social support, maternalYfetal attachment, and gravidity are discrete predictive factors of psychosocial stress in pregnant women. These findings add to existing knowledge of the factors associated with prenatal stress. Future research should include depression in a support model of antenatal stress management.

TI  - Predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms among African American HIV-positive women.
AU  - Sublette NK
AB  - This descriptive correlation study had four purposes: describe depressive and anxiety symptom levels in pregnant and non-pregnant African American (AA) HIV-positive women, examine the association between underlying vulnerabilities and depressive symptoms in HIV-positive AA women, determine the association between underlying vulnerabilities and anxiety symptoms in AA HIV-positive women, and determine the predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms among African American HIV-positive women. A convenience sample of 80 African American HIV-positive women was recruited from university-based obstetrics/-gynecology and infectious disease practices in a large metropolitan city in the Mid-South. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Edinburgh Postnatal depression Scale (EPDS). Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). An investigator-developed demographic data form was used to obtain patient characteristics including data about inherited and acquired vulnerabilities. Inherited vulnerabilities included family history of mood disorders and family history of alcohol and/or drug use. Acquired vulnerabilities included educational level, income level, alcohol and/or use, HIV disclosure status, sleep quality, and history of sexual assault. The stress diathesis theory provided the conceptual basis for the study. The sample consisted of both pregnant (n = 20) and non-pregnant (n = 60) women. Participants were typically single (57.5%), middle-aged (33.21 +/- 10.7 years), and had completed high school (30%) or some college (35%). Poverty was prevalent in the sample, with 70.5% reporting annual household incomes below $10,000. Most women (92.5%) had disclosed their HIV status. Almost half of the sample (42%) reported a history of sexual assault. Substance abuse was higher in the non-pregnant group of women (40%) than the non-pregnant group (5%) of women. Median depressive symptom scores for the total sample were mildly elevated. Median anxiety symptom scores for the total sample illustrated little or no anxiety symptoms. Poor sleep quality was prevalent in both groups and was associated with elevated CES-D, EPDS, and BAI scores in both groups of women. Family history of mood disorders was associated with elevated CES-D scores in the group of pregnant women, and elevated BAI scores in both groups. HIV disclosure was associated with elevated CES-D scores in the pregnant group, and substance use with elevated CES-D scores, in the non-pregnant group. Non-pregnant HIV-positive women had higher depressive symptom scores on both the CES-D and EPDS when compared to pregnant HIV-positive women. Regression analyses were performed to determine which independent variables predicted elevated depressive and anxiety symptom scores. Substance use and poor sleep quality were statistically significant predictors, ac counting for 55% of the variance in CES-D scores, 43% of the variance in EPDS scores, and 53% of the variance in BAI scores. Future studies should include testing interventions that improve sleep quality. Untreated mood disorders are problematic in HIV-positive patients, as depression is associated with decreased adherence to highly active antiretroviral medications. Ongoing assessments of depressive and anxiety symptoms are necessary, as clinically significant levels resulting in referrals were warranted.

AU  - Corwin EJ

T2  - Biological Research for Nursing
AB  - Fatigue is a common complaint of patients seen in primary care. Factors that contribute to fatigue in a patient population include poor health status, psychological stress, poor nutrition, and pregnancy. Less well understood are factors that contribute to fatigue among healthy, nonpregnant individuals. Within the framework of the theory of unpleasant symptoms, 40 healthy young smoking and nonsmoking adults between the ages of 18 and 35 were evaluated to determine self-report level of fatigue and contributing physiological, psychological, and situational factors. Results indicate that while self-report of fatigue did not vary in this population based on gender, subjects who were moderate to heavy cigarette smokers were significantly more fatigued than were nonsmokers (F = 10.24, df = 1, 38, P < 0.01), with the effect being specific to male smokers. Self-report of fatigue did not correlate with body mass index, baseline inflammatory or immune status, or blood pressure. Positive psychological and situational predictors of fatigue included depression (r = 0.556, P < 0.001), state anxiety (r = 0.569, P < 0.001), sleep quality (r = -0.399, P < 0.05), and sleep quantity (r = -0.411, P < 0.05). These results suggest that psychological and situational factors are key contributors to fatigue in young adults and that smoking is a risk factor for fatigue in men.

AB  - Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in pregnancy, but there are limited data on predictors.Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop predictive models of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy.Study Design: Nulliparous women completed validated questionnaires to assess for symptoms related to snoring, fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and restless leg syndrome. The questionnaires included questions regarding the timing of sleep and sleep duration, work schedules (eg, shift work, night work), sleep positions, and previously diagnosed sleep disorders. Frequent snoring was defined as self-reported snoring ≥3 days per week. Participants underwent in-home portable sleep studies for sleep-disordered breathing assessment in early (6-15 weeks gestation) and mid pregnancy (22-31 weeks gestation). Sleep-disordered breathing was characterized by an apnea hypopnea index that included all apneas, plus hypopneas with ≥3% oxygen desaturation. For primary analyses, an apnea hypopnea index ≥5 events per hour was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for predictor variables. Predictive ability of the logistic models was estimated with area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves, along with sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios.Results: Among 3705 women who were enrolled, data were available for 3264 and 2512 women in early and mid pregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%, respectively. At each time point in gestation, frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, greater maternal age, body mass index, neck circumference, and systolic blood pressure were associated most strongly with an increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Logistic regression models that included current age, body mass index, and frequent snoring predicted sleep-disordered breathing in early pregnancy, sleep-disordered breathing in mid pregnancy, and new onset sleep-disordered breathing in mid pregnancy with 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves of 0.870, 0.838, and 0.809. We provide a supplement with expanded tables, integrated predictiveness, classification curves, and an predicted probability calculator.Conclusion: Among nulliparous pregnant women, logistic regression models with just 3 variables (ie, age, body mass index, and frequent snoring) achieved good prediction of prevalent and incident sleep-disordered breathing. These results can help with screening for sleep-disordered breathing in the clinical setting and for future clinical treatment trials.

AB  - Introduction: Treatment of mild to moderate hypertension might not benefit maternal or fetal outcome. This pessimistic point of view may have come about by using non-validated methods for measuring blood pressure in pregnancy combined with inadequate methodology for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring effects.Aim: To determine the association between AASI in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and preeclampsia, and to assess the ability of AASI to diagnose preeclampsia.Material and Methods: Repeated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings were performed three times during pregnancy and once three months postpartum in 151 women with T1DM and 50 control women without diabetes. Circadian rhythm was evaluated as the night day ratio, night blood pressure divided by day blood pressure.Results: Of the T1DM women, 33 developed preeclampsia, which was associated with AASI in the 3rd trimester (p<0.05). The best predictor of preeclampsia in T1DM was an AASI of 0.35. The diurnal blood pressure was significantly higher in all trimesters in women who later had preeclampsia. A flattened circadian rhythm was present in T1DM women with preeclampsia compared to women without preeclampsia (night-day ratio: systole 2nd trimester: 0.94±0.07 vs. 0.91±0.05, women with and without preeclampsia, respectively, p=0.015; diastole 2nd trimester: 0.89±0.07 vs. 0.85±0.07, p=0.003). AASI was higher during pregnancy compared to postpartum in women with T1DM (0.31±0.16, 0.31±0.16 and 0.33±0.18 vs. 0.25±0.17; 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester vs. postpartum).Conclusion: Women with T1DM and preeclampsia demonstrate increased arterial stiffness and had early manifestations in the non-dipping of blood pressure.

AB  - Millions of pregnant women are abused each year around the world. Interpersonal violence (IPV) affects physical and mental health, both short and long term. It is associated with alcohol and drug abuse, eating and sleep disorders, physical inactivity, poor self-esteem, posttraumatic stress disorder, self-harm, unsafe sexual practices, suicide, and homicide. IPV has also been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and being small for gestational age. This article provides background information on pregnancy and IPV, as well as screening questions that may be used to support clients, and offers resources for childbirth professionals.

AB  - This study examined the course of antidepressant use, sleep quality, and depression severity from pregnancy through 6-month postpartum in women with and without a depressive disorder during pregnancy. Women ( N = 215) were interviewed during pregnancy, 1- and 6-month postpartum. Mixed linear models were used to examine the longitudinal course and inter-relationships for the time-varying variables of antidepressant use, subjective sleep quality, and depression severity. Pregnant women with a depressive disorder who did not use antidepressants had more variable depression severity over time with improvements in depression severity by 6-month postpartum. In contrast, the depression severity of their medicated counterparts remained stable and high throughout. Pregnant women without a depressive disorder had worse sleep quality when using antidepressants compared with when they were not. Antidepressant use significantly strengthened the magnitude of the effect of sleep quality on depression severity in women with a depressive disorder during pregnancy. When prenatally depressed women use antidepressants, their sleep disturbance is more highly linked to depression severity than when they do not. Furthermore, antidepressants are not adequately treating the sleep disturbance of these women or their remitted counterparts, leaving both groups vulnerable to significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.

AB  - The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study-Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) Heart Health Study (HHS) was designed to investigate the relationships between adverse pregnancy outcomes and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The ongoing nuMoM2b-HHS, which started in 2013, is a prospective follow-up of the nuMoM2b cohort, which included 10,038 women recruited between 2010 and 2013 from 8 centers across the United States who were initially observed over the course of their first pregnancies. In this report, we detail the design and study procedures of the nuMoM2b-HHS. Women in the pregnancy cohort who consented to be contacted for participation in future studies were approached at 6-month intervals to ascertain health information and to maintain ongoing contact. Two to 5 years after completion of the pregnancy documented in the nuMoM2b, women in the nuMoM2b-HHS were invited to an in-person study visit. During this visit, they completed psychosocial and medical history questionnaires and had clinical measurements and biological specimens obtained. A subcohort of participants who had objective assessments of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy were asked to repeat this investigation. This unique prospective observational study includes a large, geographically and ethnically diverse cohort, rich depth of phenotypic information about adverse pregnancy outcomes, and clinical data and biospecimens from early in the index pregnancy onward. Data obtained from this cohort will provide mechanistic and clinical insights into how data on a first pregnancy can provide information about the potential development of subsequent risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

AU  - Bush MC

T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - Severe maternal neurologic injury during pregnancy has the potential for fetal demise without advanced critical care support to the mother. Brain death is the unequivocal and irreversible loss of total brain function, whereas patients in a vegetative state, by contrast, have preserved brain stem function but lack cerebral function. They can appear to be awake, have sleep-wake cycles, be capable of swallowing, and have normal respiratory control, but there are no purposeful interactions. These conditions have different maternal prognoses, but both have resulted in near-normal neonatal outcomes with long latencies from maternal injury to delivery in previously published cases. This article compares and contrasts the 11 cases of brain death with 15 cases of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy. We found that the mean latency between maternal brain injury and delivery was significantly shorter in the brain-dead patients as compared with those in a vegetative state (46 days vs. 124 days, P </=.001). Correspondingly, the gestational ages at delivery (29.7 weeks vs. 33.2 weeks, P </=.01) and the birth weights (1380 g vs. 2145 g, P </=.01) were shorter in duration and smaller in size in the brain-dead group. We also present a case of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy at our institution with both maternal and neonatal death in the context of previously published literature with a focus on obstetric and ethical management. We hope this information will help elucidate the issues for providers confronted with these unique and challenging cases. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to state the difference between coma, persistent vegetative state and brain death, to describe the neurologic aspects of a patient in a persistent vegetative state, and to list the fetal effects of maternal brain injury.

T2  - Journal of Pain
AB  - Lumbopelvic pain is common in pregnancy but the sensitization factors underlying the condition are largely unknown. This study characterized the somatosensory profile of pregnant and nonpregnant women and the relationship between pain, hypersensitivity, and commonly used manual clinical tests. Thirty-nine pregnant and 22 nonpregnant women were included. Although lumbopelvic pain was not an inclusion criterion, the pregnant women were divided into low- and high-pain groups following data collection. The sensitivity to light brush, pin-prick, and pressure pain was assessed bilaterally at 3 sites in the lumbopelvic region, at the shoulder, and in the lower leg. Responses to the active straight leg raise test and pain provocation tests of the sacroiliac joint were recorded. Participants completed questionnaires addressing emotional and physical well-being and rated disability using the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire. Compared with controls, the high-pain group rated the active straight leg raise test as more difficult (P < .05), and both pain groups had more positive pain provocation tests (P < .05). The pregnant groups demonstrated significantly lower pressure pain thresholds at most assessment sites compared with controls (P < .05), but self-reported disability and pain were not correlated with pressure pain thresholds within pregnant participants. The high-pain group reported worse emotional health and poorer sleep quality than controls (P < .05). PERSPECTIVE: This article presents the somatosensory profile of a healthy pregnant cohort. The results indicate that pain sensitivity increases during pregnancy possibly owing to the physical changes the body undergoes during pregnancy but also owing to changes in emotional health. This should be accounted for in clinical management of pregnant women with lumbopelvic pain.

AB  - PURPOSE: To present guidelines for the recognition, management, and referral of pregnancy rhinitis with a goal of improving the quality of the pregnancy experience for women afflicted with this condition. DATA SOURCES: A case study illustrating the presentation of a severe case of pregnancy rhinitis is followed a literature review of etiology, diagnosis, and management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy rhinitis is a condition of clinical importance that is frequently exacerbated by use of intranasal decongestant sprays. The resulting rhinitis medicamentosa exacerbates the nasal obstruction, with resulting sleep disruptions that negatively impact the experience of pregnancy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurse practitioners may miss opportunities to provide support, anticipatory guidance, and symptom relief. Anticipatory guidance that stresses the critical necessity of avoiding nasal spray decongestants, environmental modification, use of intranasal saline, moderate exercise, and nasal strips for subjective relief may have the potential to markedly decrease escalation of the condition to a serious disorder.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to prospectively examine the impact of chronic vs pregnancy-onset habitual snoring on gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes.Study Design: Third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from a large, tertiary medical center from March 2007 through December 2010 and screened for the presence and duration of habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep-disordered breathing. Clinical diagnoses of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes were obtained.Results: Of 1719 pregnant women, 34% reported snoring, with 25% reporting pregnancy-onset snoring. After adjusting for confounders, pregnancy-onset, but not chronic, snoring was independently associated with gestational hypertension (odds ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.48-3.77; P < .001) and preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.37; P = .024) but not gestational diabetes.Conclusion: New-onset snoring during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In view of the significant morbidity and health care costs associated with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, simple screening of pregnant women may have clinical utility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Using laboratory-based polysomnography, we evaluated for the frequency of SDB in women with gestational hypertension compared to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. METHODS: In this single-center cross-sectional study, women with the diagnosis of gestational hypertension were screened in the Fetal Assessment Unit and Antepartum ward. Healthy subjects were recruited by local advertising. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, followed by full night polysomnography. The primary outcome was frequency of SDB (defined as a respiratory disturbance index >= 5) in the gestational hypertension and healthy groups. RESULTS: A total of 34 women with gestational hypertension and singleton pregnancies and 26 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies consented to participate in the study. The mean ages and gestational ages, but not the body mass indices, of the 2 groups were similar. The frequencies of SDB in the more obese gestational hypertension group and the healthy group were 53% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Women with gestational hypertension may have a significantly higher frequency of SDB than do healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of similar gestational age. The relative causal contributions, if any, of SDB and obesity remain to be determined. CITATION: Reid J; Skomro R; Cotton D; Ward H; Olatunbosun F; Gjevre J; Guilleminault C.

AB  - The objective of this qualitative, descriptive, exploratory study is to better understand the deficits of self-care among pregnant women/ mothers with newborns with HIV/AIDS and the factors that influence engagement with self-care. The study was carried out with ten pregnant women/mothers of newborns with HIV who use the Specialized Service for STD/AIDS in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The data was collected through a focus group and individual interviews, using a semi-structured script. After analyzing the data through content analysis, the following results were reached: the pregnant women/ mothers of newborns with HIV present deficits to self-care related to nutrition and feeding, water ingestion, sleep and rest, sexual life, leisure and recreation, and social interaction. They live so continuously with factors that contribute to engaging in self-care as factors that make this process difficult. Even with these difficulties, the pregnant women/ mothers of newborns have been able to survive into the isolation, the prejudice, receiving a support from their families and from the health care team, especially from nurses.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether stress, sleep disturbance, or fatigue at 22 to 26 weeks of gestation is related to the incidence of preterm labor and birth in military women. Data were collected prospectively by questionnaires measuring factors contributing to preterm labor and birth. Hours worked per week were ascertained by telephone until the participants delivered. Postpartum medical records were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. There was a trend for preterm labor to be associated with lower perceived fatigue severity, low sleep disturbance, and more negative life events. Officer rank was related to both preterm labor and delivery. Findings indicate that the perception of fatigue may be protective against preterm birth and that military officer rank is a risk factor for preterm labor and birth.

AB  - A case of an infant who had morphine exposure during and following pregnancy while her mother was treated with intrathecal (i.t.) morphine is presented along with a review of the relevant literature. Successful maternal pain management was achieved during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Minimal maternal serum and breast milk levels in the first 7 postpartum weeks were found. Also, infant sleep and arousal behavior and general development at 2 and 7 months were unremarkable, illustrating the possible safe and efficacious use of i.t. morphine during and following pregnancy. Further work is required to understand opioid pharmacology during breastfeeding, which will be used to develop an empirical approach to breastfeeding and morphine use.

AB  - BackgroundBrain development underlies maturation of sleep patterns throughout childhood. Intrauterine head growth-marker of early neurodevelopment-has not been associated with childhood sleep characteristics. We explored associations between ultrasonographic measures of prenatal and early postnatal neurodevelopment and childhood sleep.MethodsA total of 6,808 children from a population-based birth cohort (Generation R) were included. Head circumference (HC) and lateral ventricles size were assessed with mid- and late-pregnancy fetal ultrasounds, and with cranial ultrasound 3-20 weeks postnatally. Mothers reported children's sleep duration at 2 and 3 years, and sleep problems at 1.5, 3, and 6 years.ResultsLarger ventricular size, but not HC, was related to longer sleep duration at 3 years (β=0.06 h, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02; 0.10 in late-pregnancy and β=0.11 h, 95% CI: 0.02; 0.20 in early infancy, mid-pregnancy parameters were unrelated to sleep duration). Larger HC in mid-pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk for being a "problematic sleeper" up to the age of 6 years (odds ratio (OR): 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89; 0.99). Consistently, children with larger HC in early infancy were less likely to be "problematic sleepers" at 3 and 6 years.ConclusionsThis study shows that variations in fetal and neonatal brain size may underlie behavioral expression of sleep in childhood. Albeit small effect estimates, these associations provide evidence for neurodevelopmental origins of sleep.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence has suggested that low socioeconomic status (SES), race, prematurity, and maternal smoking during pregnancy are associated with childhood sleep disordered breathing (SDB). We investigated (1) the association of SDB with a wide range of risk factors, including prenatal and perinatal complications; (2) the association of these complications with SES and race; and (3) the association of SDB with developmental milestones. METHODS: Six hundred thirteen school-aged children (105 clinically referred and 508 community control subjects) underwent overnight polysomnography and had a complete history and physical examination. A comprehensive child development questionnaire was completed by a parent. We compared clinically referred children with SDB to population-based control children without SDB from The Penn State Children's Cohort. RESULTS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy; maternal age and weight gain during pregnancy; prenatal complications, such as maternal high blood pressure and gestational diabetes; perinatal complications related to prematurity; delayed motor milestones; race and SES were significantly associated with the presence of childhood SDB. Most of the risk factors became nonsignificant when analyses controlled for race and SES. Delayed motor milestones remained significantly associated with SDB after controlling for race and SES. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that there is a significant association between children who experience prenatal or perinatal distress and the development of moderate to severe childhood SDB. SES and race may be mediating the impact on SDB through increased prenatal and perinatal risks. The significant delay in motor milestones suggests that prenatal and perinatal distress may result in neurologic insult, which could influence the development of SDB in later childhood.

AB  - The questions addressed in this study were whether prenatal depression effects on the foetus and neonate varied by ethnicity and socio-economic status. Eighty-six depressed pregnant women were compared by ethnic group, Hispanic and African-American, and by socio-economic status (upper/lower) on prenatal and neonatal outcome variables. The Hispanic mothers were older, had a higher SES and had higher prenatal norepinephrine levels. Their foetuses were also more active. At the neonatal period they had higher anger scores, but also higher serotonin levels, and their infants had higher dopamine and lower cortisol levels and they spent less time in deep and indeterminate sleep. The comparison by middle/lower socio-economic status revealed that the middle SES group was older, had more social support and showed less depressed affect but had higher norepinephrine levels prenatally. At the postnatal period the middle SES mothers had lower depression, anxiety and anger scores and lower norepinephrine levels.Their infants also had lower norepinephrine levels, fewer postnatal complications and were less excitable on the Neonatal Behaviour Assessment Scale.

AB  - Background: Prevalence of asthma in developed countries increased between the 1970s and the 1990s. One factor that might contribute to the trends in asthma is the increased use of acetaminophen vs aspirin in children and pregnant women.Objective: To examine relationships between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and incidence of respiratory symptoms in the first year of life.Methods: A total of 345 women were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy and followed up with their children through the first year of life. Use of acetaminophen in pregnancy was determined by questionnaire and related to incidence of respiratory symptoms.Results: Use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy was significantly related to wheezing (odd ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.0) and to wheezing that disturbed sleep (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.8) in the first year of life after control for potential confounders.Conclusion: This study suggests that use of acetaminophen in middle to late but not early pregnancy may be related to respiratory symptoms in the first year of life. Additional follow-up will examine relationships of maternal and early childhood use of acetaminophen with incidence of asthma at ages 3 to 5 years, when asthma diagnosis is more firmly established.

AB  - Introduction: Maternal use of smoked tobacco during pregnancy causes significant morbidity and mortality in the human infant including alterations in autonomic control with increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. We hypothesized that maternal snus (smokeless tobacco) use during pregnancy affects autonomic cardiac regulation in the infant, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and the low frequency and high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio).Methods: A prospective observational study of 56 infants of women who used snus (n = 23) or cigarettes (n = 13) during pregnancy versus tobacco- and nicotine-free controls (n = 19). The nicotine dose was estimated by questionnaires at 4 timepoints pre- and post-natally. The infants' urine cotinine concentration and HRV during 2 hours of sleep were studied 1-2 months after birth.Results: LF/HF ratio was higher in snus (mean 3.31; 95% CI 2.78-3.83) and smoke (3.51;2.54-4.47) compared to controls (2.15; 1.76-2.54, p = .002). Early prenatal nicotine exposure "without" any further exposure increased the LF/HF ratio (3.19; 2.55-3.84, p = .02). Continuous prenatal nicotine exposure "without" postnatal exposure was also associated with a residual increase in LF/HF ratio (4.40; 3.38-5.42, p < .001). There was no difference between infants exposed to smokeless versus smoked tobacco, suggesting a common constituent (nicotine) altering autonomic cardiac regulation.Conclusion: Infants to mothers who used snus during pregnancy showed lower vagal activity with an increased LF/HF ratio compared to controls, and similar to infants of smokers. Even early prenatal exposure to snus has a lasting impact on autonomic cardiac regulation suggesting a fetal "re-programing" of the developing autonomic nervous system.Implications: The results indicate that smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) affects the developing autonomic nervous system during gestation. Even if exposure is interrupted during the first or second trimester, effects in autonomic cardiac regulation are seen in the 1-2 month-old infant. This underlines the importance of abstaining from all types of tobacco use during the whole pregnancy. Our findings may also have more general relevance to other routes by which nicotine can be delivered to a fetus and newborn.

AB  - BackgroundPrenatal maternal obesity has been linked to adverse childhood neuropsychiatric outcomes, including increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing and externalizing problems, affective disorders and neurodevelopmental problems but few studies have studied neuropsychiatric outcomes among offspring born to very severely obese women or assessed potential familial confounding by maternal psychological distress.MethodWe evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms in 112 children aged 3–5 years whose mothers had participated in a longitudinal study of obesity in pregnancy (50 very severe obesity, BMI ⩾40 kg/m2, obese class III and 62 lean, BMI 18.5–25 kg/m2). The mothers completed the Conners’ Hyperactivity Scale, Early Symptomatic Syndrome Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examination Questionnaire (ESSENCE-Q), Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess child neuropsychiatric symptoms. Covariates included child's sex, age, birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age, parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), respectively.ResultsChildren exposed to prenatal maternal very severe obesity had significantly higher scores in the Conners’ Hyperactivity Scale; ESSENCE-Q; total sleep problems in CSHQ; hyperactivity, conduct problems and total difficulties scales of the SDQ; higher externalizing and total problems, anxious/depressed, aggressive behaviour and other problem syndrome scores and higher DSM-oriented affective, anxiety and ADHD problems in CBCL. Prenatal maternal very severe obesity remained a significant predictor of child neuropsychiatric problems across multiple scales independent of demographic factors, prenatal factors and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression.ConclusionsPrenatal maternal very severe obesity is a strong predictor of increased neuropsychiatric problems in early childhood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal exposure to wood fuel smoke may lead to impaired fetal growth due to hypoxia and or oxidative stress from smoke constituents such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter. OBJECTIVES: We studied the risk of low birth weight (LBW) and reduced mean birth weight in relation to reported use of wood for cooking during the prenatal period, compared with natural gas (NG). METHODS: We studied a historical cohort of women who had a singleton live birth in the years 2000-2002, from a semirural area of Pakistan. Infant's birth weight was obtained from records, and prenatal records had data for maternal body mass index and parity. Cooking habits, daytime sleep habits, and type of fuel used during the pregnancies in 2000-2002 were ascertained by a survey done in 2004-2005. We performed multiple linear and logistic regression modeling using propensity scores to adjust for confounding variables. RESULTS: Unadjusted mean (± SD) birth weight was 2.78 ± 0.45 kg in wood users, and 2.84 ± 0.43 kg (p < 0.06) in NG users. Infants born to wood users averaged 82 g lighter than infants born to NG users when weight was adjusted for confounders (p < 0.07). The rate of LBW (< 2,500 g) was 22.7% among wood users compared with 15.0% in NG users (p < 0.01), for an adjusted relative risk of 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.34). The population attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use was estimated to be 24%. CONCLUSION: Cooking with wood fuel during pregnancy, a potentially modifiable exposure, was associated with LBW and marginally lower mean birth weight compared with using NG.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Down syndrome (DS) affects 1/800 infants. Prenatal NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) (NAP+SAL) prevent developmental delay in Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of DS. We investigated whether this finding involves N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant Ts65Dn mice were treated with placebo or NAP+SAL on gestational days 8-12. After developmental delay prevention was shown, 4 trisomic (Ts), 4 control, and 3 Ts+NAP+SAL adult offspring brains (from 3 litters) were collected. Calibrator-normalized real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subunits NR2A and NR2B, and for GABA subunits GABA(A)alpha5 and GABA(A)beta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistics included analysis of variance and Fisher PLSD with P < .05 as significant. RESULTS: NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3 levels were decreased in Ts vs control (all P < .05). Prenatal NAP+SAL increased NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3 to levels similar to control (all P < .05). A significant difference in GABA(A)alpha5 levels was not found. CONCLUSION: Prenatal NAP+SAL increases NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3 expression in adult DS mice to levels similar to controls. This may explain how NAP+SAL improve developmental milestone achievement.

T2  - Nicotine & Tobacco Research
AB  - Introduction: Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) from maternal cigarette smoking is linked to developmental deficits, including impaired auditory processing, language, generalized intelligence, attention, and sleep. Fetal brain undergoes massive growth, organization, and connectivity during gestation, making it particularly vulnerable to neurotoxic insult. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are extensively involved in growth, connectivity, and function of developing neural circuitry and neurotransmitter systems. Thus, PNE may have long-term impact on neurobehavioral development. The purpose of this study was to compare the auditory K-complex, an event-related potential reflective of auditory gating, sleep preservation and memory consolidation during sleep, in infants with and without PNE and to relate these neural correlates to neurobehavioral development.Methods: We compared brain responses to an auditory paired-click paradigm in 3- to 5-month-old infants during Stage 2 sleep, when the K-complex is best observed. We measured component amplitude and delta activity during the K-complex.Results: Infants with PNE demonstrated significantly smaller amplitude of the N550 component and reduced delta-band power within elicited K-complexes compared to nonexposed infants and also were less likely to orient with a head turn to a novel auditory stimulus (bell ring) when awake.Conclusions: PNE may impair auditory sensory gating, which may contribute to disrupted sleep and to reduced auditory discrimination and learning, attention re-orienting, and/or arousal during wakefulness reported in other studies.Implications: Links between PNE and reduced K-complex amplitude and delta power may represent altered cholinergic and GABAergic synaptic programming and possibly reflect early neural bases for PNE-linked disruptions in sleep quality and auditory processing. These may pose significant disadvantage for language acquisition, attention, and social interaction necessary for academic and social success.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in children. DESIGN: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep duration and efficiency were measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and low sleep efficiency ( < or = 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7), respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8 years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size at birth.

TI  - Prenatal sleep quality and mental health symptoms across the perinatal period: A longitudinal study of high-risk women.
AU  - Paulson, Julia L.
AU  - Miller-Graff, Laura
T2  - Journal of Psychosomatic Research
AB  - Background: Trauma-exposed women may be at magnified risk for posttraumatic stress (PTSS) and depression symptoms in the perinatal period, but few studies have examined symptomatology across the perinatal period in high-risk samples. Further, the role of sleep in perinatal symptomatology has been largely neglected in the violence literature, despite its well-established associations to mental health in other samples. This study aimed to examine the trajectory of PTSS and depression symptoms across the perinatal period and the effects of childhood adversity, intimate partner violence and prenatal sleep impairment on PTSS and depression symptoms across the perinatal period.Method: In a longitudinal, prospective study, 101 low-income pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy, at 6-weeks postpartum, and 4 months postpartum. N = 83 women completed at least 2 interviews and were included in the analyses. Prenatal sleep, childhood adversity, and IPV exposure were assessed at the prenatal interview; PTSS and depression were assessed at all interviews.Results: Past year IPV was associated with elevated prenatal mental health symptoms and prenatal sleep difficulties were associated with a worsening trajectory in perinatal PTSS.Conclusions: Screening for IPV and prenatal sleep difficulties may be paramount in identifying those at risk for the development or exacerbation of mental health symptoms in the perinatal period.

AU  - Filus, Ania
T2  - BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth
AB  - Background: Becoming the parent of a new baby comes with a range of challenges including difficulties with emotional adjustment, couple relationship issues and difficulty managing common infant behaviors, such as crying and sleep problems. This time can be especially challenging for couples who experience a range of risk factors. Previous parenting interventions for parents of babies have shown mixed results. This protocol paper describes a randomized controlled trial of a group-based parenting intervention for high-risk parents expecting their first baby.Methods/design: Participants will be randomized to either Group Baby Triple P or Care as Usual (CAU). Group Baby Triple P involves 4 × 2 h group sessions delivered during pregnancy and 4 individual telephone sessions of 30 min each in the early postnatal period. Outcomes will be assessed via parent self-report questionnaire, home observations and a baby diary 10 weeks and 6 months post-birth. Primary outcomes will be parental confidence and perceived competence. Secondary outcomes will include parental responsiveness and bonding with the baby, relationship happiness, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety and stress, and infant crying and sleep. Analyses will involve a series of rANOVA and rMANOVAs, t-tests and a multilevel modeling approach.Discussion: A brief summary, strengths and potential implications are discussed.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ANZCTR 12613000948796 .

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Both restless legs syndrome ([RLS], also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease [WED]) and depression are common during pregnancy. However, no prior studies have assessed if pregnant women with RLS have an elevated risk of depression during and/or after pregnancy. METHODS: 1,428 women who were pregnant in gestational week 16-17 were asked to participate in a longitudinal survey. They were followed by web-based questionnaires in gestational week 17 and 32, and 6 weeks after delivery. Data were also retrieved from prenatal and birth records. Two different sets of criteria were used to examine the prevalence of RLS in the cohort (International Restless Legs Syndrome Society Group standard criteria and the later developed CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire). The latter questionnaire attempts to exclude those with common 'mimics' of RLS. RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratio for depression in gestational week 17, 32, and postpartum week 6 in relation to pre-pregnancy RLS onset and moderate to severe symptom severity were 4.74 (2.30 - 9.76), 3.67 (1.85 - 7.28), and 2.58 (1.28 - 5.21), respectively. No significant associations were seen in pregnant women with de novo RLS during pregnancy. When using the standard diagnostic RLS criteria and frequency of symptoms more than 2-3 days per week, the prevalence of RLS was 12.3%. With the CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire and the same threshold for frequency of symptoms the prevalence was 6.5%. CONCLUSION: Women with RLS onset before pregnancy with moderate or severe symptoms had an increased risk of both antenatal and postnatal depression. The self-reported prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is lower when a questionnaire dealing with 'mimics' is used. CITATION: Wesström J, Skalkidou A, Manconi M, Fulda S, Sundström-Poromaa I.

T2  - Acta Paediatrica
AB  - Aim: This study aimed to determine whether measures of intermittent hypoxia derived from 24-hour oximetry correlate with measures of apnoea derived from modified nap polysomnography undertaken for preterm infants before discharge.Methods: Infants born ≤32 weeks of gestation were recruited from the neonatal intensive care unit and had a modified polysomnography to assess their respiratory stability once they were ≥35 weeks of postmenstrual age. Infants were defined as unstable if they had more than 10 obstructive events per hour or any apnoea of >20 seconds in length. Infants also had a 24-hour oximetry performed during this period. The results of the 24-oximetry desaturation index (DSI) were compared to nap polysomnography results for central and obstructive apnoea indices and correlations tested.Results: Twenty-four infants completed the study. There were 15 (63%) infants defined as unstable by the modified polysomnography. The 3% DSI and 4% DSI from the 24-hour oximetry were significantly higher in the unstable infants, and values for all infants correlated with the obstructive index and the central apnoea index from the modified polysomnography.Conclusion: The 3% DSI and 4% DSI values from a 24-hour oximetry study may provide noninvasive measures of respiratory stability in preterm infants ready for discharge.

TI  - Preterm infant's response to male and female voices in the NICU.
AU  - Lee H
AB  - A newborn infant's early attentive behavior to maternal vocalization is known to promote early interaction between the mother and the infant. Full-term infants at birth can recognize their mothers' voices. It is believed that this early ability of newborn infants is acquired from prenatal experience with the mother's voice. The mother's voice is the most salient sound in the uterus, and the fetus can hear sound beginning of 24 weeks gestation. However, preterm infants are born with insufficient prenatal vocal experience and an immature auditory system which is more sensitive to low frequency sounds than high frequency sounds. Preterm infants have minimal exposure to the human voice in the NICU but are exposed to loud mechanical noises. Preteen infant may hear the male voice better than the female voice to produce attentive behaviors.The purpose of this study was to examine preterm infants' responsiveness to female and male voice over time. Nineteen preterm infants (< 32 weeks gestation) were enrolled in the study. The sleep/awake state, motor (stress and self-regulatory) behavior, and autonomic (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) responses were recorded by a Gould Recording System and two digital video cameras. The data was collected once a week from 32 weeks post-conceptional age through hospital discharge. Changes from baseline in each infant's responses during the vocal stimulation and during the post-vocal stimulation were analyzed using a chi square test and MANOVA.Results indicated that the drowsy state increased during vocal stimulation and after vocal stimulation the asleep state increased. The heart rate of the preterm infant increased slightly during vocal stimulation but decreased after vocal stimulation. Overall, the vocal stimulation did not evoke either stress or self-regulatory responses during presentation. The difference in the preterm infant responses to the male and the female voices was not statistically significant.Vocal stimulation has some benefit for the preterm infant as evidenced by increased sleep state, no stress responses, and the cardiac orienting response. These data provide an insight into the early auditory responses of the preterm intent to human voice, with implications for both parent(s) and health care providers to enhance early interaction between the parents and the infants in the NICU.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and to evaluate factors associated with RLS in a population of Iranian pregnant women.Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, 443 consecutive pregnant women admitted for delivery underwent an interview within 2 days of parturition. The diagnosis of RLS was established by the 4 criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). The severity of RLS was assessed through the IRLSSG Rating Scale.Results: Seventy-nine (17.8%) women met the RLS diagnostic criteria, with most (74.7%) having RLS of moderate severity. The mean RLS duration before delivery was 3.1 ± 2.1 months among 69 (87.3%) women; 10 (12.7%) had RLS onset before pregnancy. Sleep disturbances including insomnia and early awakening were significantly more common among women with RLS than among those without (P < 0.001), and the frequency of cesarean delivery was also significantly higher (58.2% versus 44.5%, P = 0.027; odds ratio 2.4). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, number of pregnancies, folate and iron supplementation, hemoglobin level, and neonatal anthropometric data.Conclusion: Restless legs syndrome is common during pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep and an increased risk of cesarean delivery.

T2  - Maternal & Child Health Journal
AB  - Objectives To examine: (1) the prevalence and characteristics of bed-sharing among non-Hispanic Black and White infants in Georgia, and (2) differences in bed-sharing and sleep position behaviors prior to and after the American Academy of Pediatrics' 2005 recommendations against bed-sharing. Methods Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Analysis was guided by the socioecological model levels of: Infant, Maternal, Family, and Community/Society within the context of race. Data from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed to address the first objective and from 2000 to 2004 and 2006 to 2011 to address the second objective. Rao-Scott Chi square tests and backward selection unconditional logistic regression models for weighted data were built separately by race; odds ratios (OR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results A total of 6595 (3528 Black and 3067 White) cases were analyzed between 2004 and 2011. Significantly more Black mothers (81.9 %) reported 'ever' bed-sharing compared to White mothers (56 %), p < 0.001. Logistic regression results indicated that the most parsimonious model included variables from all socioecological levels. For Blacks, the final model included infant age, pregnancy intention, number of dependents, and use of Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Services. For Whites, the final model included infant age, maternal age, financial stress, partner-related stress, and WIC. When comparing the period 2000-2004 to 2006-2011, a total of 10,015 (5373 Black and 4642 White cases) were analyzed. A significant decrease in bedsharing was found for both Blacks and Whites; rates of non-supine sleep position decreased significantly for Blacks but not Whites. Conclusions for Practice Continued high rates of bed-sharing and non-supine sleep position for both Blacks and Whites demonstrate an ongoing need for safe infant sleep messaging. Risk profiles for Black and White mothers differed, suggesting the importance of tailored messaging. Specific research and practice implications are identified and described.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP), leg pain (LP), and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnant Spanish women and to identify the factors associated with a higher risk. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies on the prevalence and risk factors for LBP and PGP have shown inconsistent results. METHODS: Sixty-one clinicians across 5 regions in Spain recruited 1158 women with a median (interquartile range) pregnancy of 35 (range, 31-38) weeks. Validated methods were used to gather data on the prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP, anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics, history of LBP, obstetrical history, physical activity before and during pregnancy, mattress and sleep characteristics, disability, anxiety, and depression. Separate multiple logistic regression models were developed to identify the variables associated with LBP, LP, and PGP. RESULTS: The 4-week prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP was 71.3%, 46.2%, and 64.7%, respectively. Main factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting pain for LBP were history of LBP related and unrelated to previous pregnancy and postpartum, pain augmenting with time spent in bed, and anxiety. Previous lumbar surgery was associated with a lower risk. The factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting LP were reporting LBP, lower academic level, younger age, depression, a lower number of hours of sleep per day, and a higher BMI, and for PGP were higher score for depression, a higher body mass index, and a more advanced stage of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with a higher risk vary between LBP and PGP. History of LBP, related or not to previous pregnancy or postpartum, LBP surgery, and anxiety were the factors more strongly associated with pregnancy-related LBP. When these variables are taken into account, obstetrical data from current or previous pregnancies and other variables do not show a significant association with LBP. Stage of pregnancy and depression were associated with PGP.

T2  - BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth
AB  - Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is not only a severe public health issue that jeopardizes maternal and foetal health but also violates human rights. The aim was to explore the prevalence and incidence of domestic violence among pregnant women, in the southwestern region of Scania in Sweden, and their experience of a history of violence. In addition, to explore the association between domestic violence during pregnancy and possible risk factors.Methods: This is a longitudinal cohort-study including pregnant women ≥18 years of age, registered at antenatal care when pregnant. A cohort of 1939 pregnant women answered Questionnaire I (QI) in gestational week 13 (mean 12.8 week, SD 5.11). Response rate of Questionnaire II (QII) in gestation week 34 (mean 33.9 week, SD 2.2) was 78.8 % (n = 1527). Statistical analysis was descriptive statistics, logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).Results: Both QI and QII were completed by 77.8 % (n = 1509) of the women and 44.3 % (n = 668) reported a lifetime experience of abuse irrespective of type, severity or perpetrator. Also, 5.1 % (n = 77) reported some experience of abuse past year. Prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy was 2.0 % (n = 29) and the incidence was 7.3 new cases per 1000 women. The strongest risk factor for domestic violence, during early and late pregnancy, was history of violence whereby all women who disclosed exposure had also reported history of violence (p < 0.001). To be single/living apart gave 8.4 times more risk associated with domestic violence during pregnancy (AOR 8.4; 95 % CI: 2.2-32.6). Having several symptoms of depression and lack of sleep gave 3.8 times more risk respectively (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI: 1.1-13.6) and (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI 1.1-12.9).Conclusions: Pregnant women with a history of violence as well as being single/living apart and/or having several symptoms of depression during pregnancy should be alerts for clinical working midwives and obstetricians. Further, this is important knowledge for health care providers to develop or upgrade guidelines and plans of action for pregnant women exposed to violence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recognized in the Western world as a public health burden, but there has been no community-based study performed to assess the prevalence of the condition in India. The study was performed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of OSA in a semi-urban Indian population. DESIGN: A two-stage, cross-sectional, community-based prevalence study. SETTING: A semi-urban community in Delhi.Duration: Two years (2003 to 2005).Patients and participants: All citizens residing in the community who were 30 to 60 years of age. Exclusion criteria included those patients with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV congestive heart failure, pregnancy, hypothyroidism on treatment, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, systemic steroid treatment, and hormone replacement therapy. INTERVENTION: An OSA assessment was performed in 2,400 subjects who were screened in stage 1 of the study by means of a sleep questionnaire. Subjects were then divided into habitual and nonhabitual snorers. Eighty-three randomly selected habitual snorers and 80 nonhabitual snorers were invited to participate in stage 2 of the study, which consisted of in-hospital polysomnography studies.Observations and results: A total of 2,150 subjects returned questionnaires (response rate, 90%). Of 550 habitual snorers and 1,596 nonhabitual snorers, 77 habitual snorers and 73 nonhabitual snorers underwent polysomnography. A total of 36 habitual snorers (46.75%) and 2 nonhabitual snorers (2.73%) were found to have OSA, giving prevalence rates of 13.74% and 3.57%, respectively, for OSA and OSA syndrome (OSAS) on extrapolation. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, age, obesity (defined by a high body mass index), and waist/hip ratio as significant risk factors for OSAS. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the risk factors and prevalence for OSA in India are similar to those in the West, which is contrary to the findings of some previous reports, which had a strong inclusion bias.

AB  - Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is a serious public health issue which threatens maternal and foetal health outcomes. The aim of the study was to explore prevalence of domestic violence among pregnant women in southern Sweden (Scania) and to explore associations with background factors, as symptoms of depression and sense of coherence.Methods: This study has a cross-sectional design and is the first part of a longitudinal, cohort study. Inclusion criteria were women ≥ 18 years, registered at antenatal care when pregnant and who understand and write Swedish or English. Questionnaires were collected prospectively at seventeen antenatal care receptions situated in the two cities and six smaller municipalities in Scania. Statistical analyses were done using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, bivariate logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Study sample included 1939 women. History of violence was reported by 39.5% (n =761) women. Significant differences were obtained between the groups with or without history of violence regarding being single/living apart, unemployment, financial distress, smoking/snuffing, unintended pregnancy as well as history of miscarriage/legalised abortion (p < 0.001). Experience of domestic violence during pregnancy regardless of type or level of abuse was 1.0% (n = 18); history of physical abuse by actual intimate partner was 2.2% (n = 42). History of violence was the strongest risk factor associated with domestic violence during pregnancy, where all women (n = 18) exposed reported history of violence (p < 0.001). Several symptoms of depression (adjusted for low socio-economic status, miscarriage/abortion, single/living apart, lack of sleep, unemployment, age and parity) were associated with a 7.0 fold risk of domestic violence during pregnancy (OR 7.0; 95% CI: 1.9-26.3).Conclusions: The reported prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy in southwest Sweden is low. However, a considerable proportion of women reported history of living in a violent relationship. Both history of violence and the presence of several depressive symptoms detected in early pregnancy may indicate that the woman also is exposed to domestic violence during pregnancy. Increased attention to this vulnerable group of women is needed to improve maternal and child health.

AB  - Problem/Condition: Various maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy (e.g., unintended pregnancy, late entry into prenatal care, cigarette smoking, not breast-feeding) are associated with adverse health outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Information regarding maternal behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends, to enhance the understanding of the relations between behaviors and health outcomes, to plan and evaluate programs, to direct policy decisions, and to monitor progress toward Healthy People 2000 and 2010 objectives.Reporting Period Covered: This report covers data from 1993 through 1999.Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver a live-born infant. PRAMS employs a mixed-mode data collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with a telephone interview. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets. PRAMS generates statewide estimates of various perinatal health topics among women delivering a live infant. Data for 1999 from 17 states are examined. In addition, trend data are examined for 12 states that had at least 3 years of data during 1993--1999.Results: In 1999, the prevalence of unintended pregnancy resulting in a live birth ranged from 33.7% to 52% across the 17 states. During 1993--1999, only one state reported a decreasing trend in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy. Women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care ranged from 16.1% to 29.9%. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care significantly decreased over time in seven of the 12 states with trend data. In general, women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report late or no entry into prenatal care. The prevalence of smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 6.2% to 27.2%, and the prevalence decreased in five states from 1993 to 1999. Overall, smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy was associated with younger age (<25 years), non-Hispanic ethnicity, having less than or equal to a high . school education, receiving Medicaid, and delivering a low birthweight infant. The prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during pregnancy ranged from 2.1% to 6.3%. No trends were observed for physical abuse from 1996 to 1999, the only years for which these data were available. Across the 17 states, only Medicaid status was consistently associated with experiencing physical abuse during pregnancy. The prevalence of breast-feeding initiation ranged from 48% to 89%. Ten of 12 states with trend data reported increases in the prevalence of breast-feeding initiation. Overall, women aged <20 years, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were less likely to breast-feed. The prevalence of breast-feeding duration for at least 4 weeks ranged from 34.9% to 78.1%. From 1993 to 1999, increases in levels of breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks were observed in eight states. Women aged <25 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were generally less likely to breast-feed for at least 4 weeks. The prevalence of back sleep position for infants ranged from 35.1% to 74.6%. Increases in the use of the back sleep position were observed in all 12 states with trend data from 1996 to 1999. Black race and having less than or equal to a high school education were consistently associated with not using the back sleep position.Interpretation: For surveillance during 1993--1999, the majority or all states observed increases in breast-feeding initiation, breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks, and back sleep position. Approximately one half of the states observed decreases for late or no entry into prenatal care and smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Little or no progress was observed in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy or physical abuse during pregnancy.With few exceptions, the 17 states failed to meet the Healthy People 2000 objectives for the seven reported behaviors in 1999. Certain demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of women were associated with an increased risk for several of the behaviors, including younger age, black race, less education, and receipt of Medicaid just before or during pregnancy.Public Health Action: State maternal and child health programs can use these population-based data for reporting on core and state-negotiated performance measures of the Title V Block Grant Measurement Performance System. The data, which are important in planning and evaluation programs, help identify whether target populations are receiving services and help identify barriers to or gaps in services. The data can be shared with policy makers to direct policy decisions that might affect the health of mothers and infants. In addition, these findings can be used to monitor progress toward Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010 objectives.

AB  - Objective: Sleep deficiency is an emerging concept denoting a deficit in the quantity or quality of sleep. This may be particularly salient for pregnant women since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation (10-20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms and stress. Methods: Pregnant women (N=160) with no self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks' gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results: Approximately 28%-38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient ( p<0.01). Depressive symptoms were higher among women with diary-defined sleep deficiency across all time points ( p=0.02). Discussion: Sleep deficiency is a useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the factors associated with their smoking behavior. METHOD: Five hundred institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these institutions, 260 participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2002. Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior. RESULTS: Data were obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% CI 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep duration and in women who drank. CONCLUSION: Smoking among pregnant women remains an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote antismoking measures based on the results of this study.

AB  - Introduction: recent studies suggest that women with gestational diabetes are more likely to suffer sleep disorders compared to pregnant women without diabetes. The objectives of this study were to analyze the risk factors associated with gestational diabetes and to verify if exist an association between the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes and the quality of the sleep and/or daytime sleepiness. Material and methods: case-controls study with a sample of 130 pregnant women, 46 of them with gestational diabetes and 84 controls. Anthropometric parameters such as weight, stature, body mass index (BMI) and abdominal perimeter were evaluated. Socio-demographic variables, including age and family situation were assessed, and a gynecological study was performed, evaluating the number of simple or multiple births, number of miscarriages and gynecological pathology during the past 3 years. The O'Sullivan test was conducted for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The quality of sleep and daytime sleepiness were also measured. Results: 46 women were diagnosed of gestational diabetes. There are significant differences (p < 0.001) in BMI scores among women with gestational diabetes and controls, being the highest values in the diabetic group. There is a significant association (p = 0.002) between the existence of family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes present a significant worse quality of sleep (p < 0.001), and values of daytime sleepiness higher than the general population. Conclusions: high values of BMI or family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be factors associated to the risk of suffer gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes have a poorer quality of sleep and a higher degree of daytime sleepiness than the general population, reducing the well-being of the mother and the fetus.

AB  - Obesity is one of the major health problems and a determining factor in the prevalence of diseases such as metabolic syndrome, asthma, sleep apnea, infertility and various types of cancer. Its origin is multifactorial, involving genetic, socioeconomic and environmental factors. These last ones contribute mostly to explain the current epidemic growth of this disease. The sedentary lifestyle, inadequate diet, lack of sleep, alterations in intestinal microbiota and stress are factors related to its development. Since Barker presented his hypothesis about the "fetal origin of adult diseases", there are increasing number of studies that show the influence of an inadequate nutritional status and maternal weight in the development of chronic diseases, as obesity in offspring. The nutritional deficiencies of the pregnant mother cause epigenetic modifications and abnormal programming of the development oforgans and devices, adapting the fetus to this situation of deficiency and being able to adapt to an obesogenic environment after birth, increasing its propensity to obesity. Also, poor maternal nutritional status is related to intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight infants, with a higher risk of childhood and adult central obesity. Currently, deficient intake of micronutrients and overweight or maternal obesity tend to overlap, and this combination may exacerbate the increase in obesity in the offspring. It is important to identify pregnant mothers at risk of suffering nutritional alterations and establish their improvement as a primary prevention strategy for overweight and obesity.

AB  - Background: Rapid weight gain during the first three years of life predicts child and adult obesity, and also later cardiovascular and other morbidities. Cross-sectional studies suggest that infant diet, activity and sleep are linked to excessive weight gain. As intervention for overweight children is difficult, the aim of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study is to evaluate two primary prevention strategies during late pregnancy and early childhood that could be delivered separately or together as part of normal health care.Methods/design: This four-arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 800 families recruited at booking in the only maternity unit in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. Mothers are randomised during pregnancy to either a usual care group (7 core contacts with a provider of government funded "Well Child" care over 2 years) or to one of three intervention groups given education and support in addition to "Well Child" care: the Food, Activity and Breastfeeding group which receives 8 extra parent contacts over the first 2 years of life; the Sleep group which receives at least 3 extra parent contacts over the first 6 months of life with a focus on prevention of sleep problems and then active intervention if there is a sleep problem from 6 months to 2 years; or the Combination group which receives all extra contacts. The main outcome measures are conditional weight velocity (0-6, 6-12, 12-24 months) and body mass index z-score at 24 months, with secondary outcomes including sleep and physical activity (parent report, accelerometry), duration of breastfeeding, timing of introduction of solids, diet quality, and measures of family function and wellbeing (parental depression, child mindedness, discipline practices, family quality of life and health care use). This study will contribute to a prospective meta-analysis of early life obesity prevention studies in Australasia.Discussion: Infancy is likely to be the most effective time to establish patterns of behaviour around food, activity and sleep that promote healthy child and adult weight. The POI.nz study will determine the extent to which sleep, food and activity interventions in infancy prevent the development of overweight.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials NCT00892983.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure and whether the neuroprotective effects of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-related peptides, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), are mediated through BDNF. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. RESULTS: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P<.05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<.05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P>.05). CONCLUSION: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS.

AB  - PurposeThis study was conducted for the purpose of assessing the validity of having pregnant women monitor their own pregnancies by producing a self-monitoring check sheet relating to self-care during pregnancy.MethodsSurvey 1 : A survey was conducted on 55 pregnant women in which the subjects were asked to describe their experiences and opinions relating to maintaining and promoting health during pregnancy.Surveys 2 and 3 : A survey was conducted on 31 pregnant women (in week 19 to 38 of pregnancy) for 7 to 8 days in which the subjects were asked to monitor their pregnancies using a check sheet in addition to measuring the amounts of walking and physical activity, recording waking and sleeping times, sleep time and dietary contents (Survey 2). In survey 3, the levels of apprehension and depression were measured before and after monitoring and the subjects were interviewed.ResultsA check sheet (daily maternity check sheet) was produced consisting of the 10 items of sleeping status, fetal movement, abdomen and bleeding, body weight, diet, exercise, daily activities, mood (comfort), maternal image and communication with the fetus, along with a column for allowing subjects to write down any comments they may have. In Surveys 2 and 3, there was a correlation between monitoring of the amount of walking and exercise and monitoring relating to sleep time and sleep status, fetal movement and abdominal distention.The amount of daily activity during the day, abdominal distention and psychological state had an effect on sleeping. (3) Agreement was confirmed between dietary contents, the contents of comments written by the subjects and monitoring. (4) It was possible to objectively make a retrospective assessment of the behavior and emotional state of pregnant women through self-monitoring.ConclusionThe use of a daily maternity check sheet was confirmed to enable pregnant women to implement objective self-monitoring of their pregnancies with only a minimal burden.

AB  - Objective: To characterize sleep patterns among pregnant women undergoing prolonged antepartum hospitalization.Study design: We conducted a prospective cohort study of women undergoing prolonged antepartum hospitalization after 20 weeks’ gestation. Women were recruited to wear an Actigraph, complete a sleep log for 7 consecutive days, and complete a sleep survey at the end of the study period. Actigraphy was used to determine rest and sleep intervals, sleep onset latency, and wake time after sleep onset.Results: A total of 40 participants were recruited, and 28 had ≥ 5 nights of data for a total of 177 nights of antepartum sleep data. Mean gestational age was 30 weeks. Median sleep duration was 7.05 h ± 1.71 h. In all, 43.5% of women had an average sleep duration of <7 h per night. In all, 28.2% of the study nights had a bedtime between midnight and 5 am. Going to bed between midnight and 5 am was significantly associated with sleep durations of <7 h (70.7 vs. 32.5%, p < .001). Participants reported an average of 2.4 awakenings per night due to hospital-related events.Conclusions: Prolonged antepartum hospitalization has a negative impact on sleep duration and quality.

AB  - Background: African-American (AA) women have poorer pregnancy outcomes, and studies in nonpregnant women suggest a different etiology of weight gain in AA compared with white women. We hypothesized that physiologic factors such as low energy expenditure and physical activity would be present in AA compared with white women in pregnancy. Objective: We aimed to identify physiologic risk factors for disordered energy balance in AA and white women early in pregnancy. Design: This was a cross-sectional study in 66 pregnant women with obesity, between 14 and 16 wk of gestation. Energy intake was calculated using the intake-balance method. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)] over 7 d with the use of doubly labelled water and during sleep [sleeping EE (SleepEE)] in a room calorimeter. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical activity by accelerometers.Markers of metabolic health were obtained from fasting blood and urine. Results: AA (n = 34) and white (n = 32) women were comparable in age (mean ± SEM: 27.7 ± 0.6 y), enrollment body mass index [mean ± SEM (in kg/m2): 36.9 ± 0.7], and body fat (mean ± SEM: 45.0%±0.6%). AA women had more fat-freemass (P=0.01) and tended to be more insulin-resistant (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, P = 0.06). Energy intake was signifi- cantly lower in AA than in white women (2499 ± 76 compared with 2769 ± 58 kcal/d, P = 0.001), although absolute TDEE was comparable (AA: 2590 ± 77 kcal/d; white: 2711 ± 56 kcal/d; P = 0.21). After adjusting for body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231 ± 74 kcal/d, P = 0.003), as was SleepEE (-81 ± 37 kcal/d, P = 0.03). Physical activity, substrate oxidation, and metabolic biomarkers (triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations, catecholamine excretion) were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions: Body mass-adjusted energy expenditure is significantly lower in AA than in white pregnant women. Energy intake recommendations for pregnancy do not consider this difference and may therefore overestimate energy requirements in AA women. This may lead to unintentional overeating and contribute to the disparity of excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention that is more prevalent in AA women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01954342.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involves episodic nocturnal apneas. Using polysomnography, we examined the predictive capacity of screening questionnaires (Berlin) in pregnancy. Incorporating simultaneous fetal heart rate monitoring (FHM), we examined the association of maternal apnea with FHM abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 100 pregnant women at 26-39 weeks of gestation with OSA screening and baseline data ascertainment who underwent polysomnography and FHM for > or =3 hours. The relationship between maternal characteristics, OSA, and FHM was explored with multivariate analyses that were controlled for potential confounders. RESULTS: When compared with polysomnography, sensitivity and specificity by Berlin screening was 35% and 63.8%, respectively; the snoring component of the Berlin correlated better with oxygen desaturation <95% (P = .003). Body mass index was a significant confounder (r(s) = 0.44; P < .0001). No association was observed between FHM abnormalities and OSA parameters. CONCLUSION: In pregnancy, the Berlin questionnaire poorly predicts OSA. It is unclear whether fetal compromise during maternal apnea is a mechanism in OSA that is related to pregnancy outcome.

AU  - Chiu, Edward
T2  - Meridians: The Journal of Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine
AB  - This single case outlines the acupuncture treatment of a 34-year-old female patient with chronic pain from psoriatic arthritis. She presented with multiple painful and inflamed joints, including in the hips, shoulders, lumbar spine, jaw, fingers, and toes. She experienced significant pain, which interrupted her sleep and kept her from focusing her attention on a daily basis. Concurrently, she and her partner hoped to conceive and were concerned with pregnancy risks associated with her pain medications. After 21 acupuncture treatments over the course of 14 weeks, the patient experienced relief to the extent that she was able to completely eliminate the use of pain medication before conceiving with her partner. At various stages in this case, a variety of acupuncture approaches were applied, including methods from traditional Chinese medicine, five element constitutional acupuncture, and Japanese styles of acupuncture. This case demonstrates the clinical choices made in the application of various acupuncture modalities along this patient's treatment course. Using case reports such as this to discern the strengths, weaknesses, and best applications of each style may be useful in guiding the evolution of acupuncture practice.

AB  - The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to compare psychological distress as measured via self-reported perceived stress, sleep, and fatigue levels in lactating mothers of a term infant and mothers of a preterm infant and(b) to determine whether the addition of psychological distress to a previous model predicts milk volume at Postpartum Week 6 by gestation group. The convenience sample of 95 mothers of a preterm infant (31 weeks) and 98 mothers of a term infant completed the Perceived Stress Visual Analogue Scale, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, and the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale. Stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue levels decreased during the 6-week study period for mothers of a term but not for mothers of a preterm infant. Perceived stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue during the first 6 weeks postpartum were not related to milk volume; thus, the mother's perceived psychological distress had no apparent effect on lactation.

AB  - Background: Fatigue is among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Estimating fatigue severity with a psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for understanding women's fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: The study was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within three months postpartum. Results: The C-LFS-SF showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ≥ .97) and stability over the 7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient > .87). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 88-94% of the total variance was explained by the one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct validity. Conclusions: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk pregnancies or with medical conditions.

AB  - Background: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was initially developed to measure daytime sleep propensity in patients affected by a variety of sleep disorders. Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS, although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been conducted with this population.Objective: The objective was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who received prenatal care was at Magee-Women's Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that completed the ESS.Methods: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).Results: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor solution. An overall Cronbach's alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability (Factor 1α=.754; Factor 2α=.524). Both convergent and discriminant validity were established.Conclusion: The ESS is appropriate for use in an obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women.

T2  - Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine
AB  - Study Objectives: We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the Spanish-language version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) among pregnant Peruvian women.Methods: A cohort of 642 women were interviewed at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation. During interview, we ascertained information about lifestyles, demographics, sleep characteristics, and mood symptoms. Stress induced sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assessment scales, respectively. Consistency indices, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlations, and logistic regressions were used.Results: Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a three-factor solution: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and sleep medication. We observed significantly positive correlations of the PSQI with the FIRST (0.42), the PHQ-9 (0.49), and the GAD-7 (0.46). Poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5) had significantly increased odds of experiencing stress-induced sleep disturbance (odds ratio, OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.40, 5.31), depression (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 3.58, 8.37), and generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.57; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.76).Conclusion: The Spanish-language version of the PSQI instrument was found to have good construct validity among pregnant Peruvian women. Consistent with some other studies, the PSQI was found to have a three-factor structure. Further assessment and validation studies are needed to determine whether the three, factor-specific scoring of the PSQI is favored over the PSQI global score in diverse populations.

TI  - Psychophysiological correlates of fatigue during childbirth.
AU  - Pugh LC
AB  - The purpose of this descriptive longitudinal study was to examine the levels of fatigue that primiparous women experience during childbirth and its association with maternal factors. A convenient sample consisting of 100 primiparous women interviewed on admission to the labor and delivery unit of a large suburban hospital was obtained. These women were interviewed three times at two-hour intervals during labor unless they delivered before these time periods or were administered epidural anesthesia. The final interview was within twenty-four hours of delivery. The subjective, cognitive and physiological dimensions of fatigue were measured by the Fatigue Symptom Checklist and Visual Analogue Scales, the Digit Span Subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (revised R), and a hand held bulb dynamometer. A repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated that fatigue significantly increased as labor progressed. Fatigue was found to be high for these women as a group when they were admitted to the hospital and it continued to increase during labor. A canonical correlation was computed to determine the best predictors for fatigue. The predictor set of variables included: (1) whether the woman took formal childbirth education classes; (2) the amount of sleep; (3) whether she exercised during the last trimester of pregnancy; (4) whether she worked during the last trimester of pregnancy; (5) her state and trait levels of anxiety; and (6) whether she had been medicated prior to the interview. On admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were, state anxiety, amount of sleep, trait anxiety, and medication. Two hours after admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were previous fatigue, medication and work. Four hours after admission, the variables were medication, previous fatigue, exercise and childbirth education. Six hours after admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were previous fatigue, medication, exercise and work. Within 24 hours after delivery, the greatest predictor of fatigue was previous fatigue. There was a positive correlation between fatigue scores on admission and subsequent fatigue scores during labor. Women who had strong contractions reported significantly higher levels of fatigue at 2, 4 and 6 hours after admission. Women who used intense pattern of breathing exercises reported significantly higher levels of fatigue than those who used slow chest breathing. The total length of labor was significantly correlated with fatigue scores after delivery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of psychosocial and demographic variables to health behaviors in early pregnancy. DESIGN: First trimester findings presented from a prospective study of weight gain in pregnancy. SETTING: A comprehensive health care system in central Texas. PARTICIPANTS: 114 pregnant women (75% white, 13% African American, 10% Hispanic, 2% Asian) of 12 weeks gestation or less. OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-Care Inventory, which includes diet/eating, substance abuse, recklessness, hygiene-related practices, sleep/rest, and exercise behaviors. RESULTS: In regression analysis the final model of demographic and psychosocial variables showed that higher depressive symptoms, lower internal locus of control for fetal health, and lower family income were related to poorer health behaviors in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Health behaviors in early pregnancy may be affected by psychosocial factors such as depressive symptoms. Greater emphasis should be given to such factors in research and prenatal assessments.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigated whether psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are prevalent amongst women in pregnancy and/or in the early postnatal phase, and whether the predictors identified in the literature for non-puerperal psychosis apply in a general sample of perinatal women.Method: 101 women in their third trimester of pregnancy completed questionnaire measures of mood, subjective well-being, sleep, expectations about labour, and PLEs. 66 of these participants also completed questionnaires shortly after giving birth. The main outcome measures were scores on the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) and the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R).Results: During pregnancy, 80% of the samples endorsed at least one item on the PDI, and 76% endorsed at least one item on the LSHS-R. Endorsement rates were lower postnatally, with rates of 59% and 52% for the PDI and LSHS-R, respectively. Mean scores on the PDI were 3.07 during pregnancy and 1.61 postnatally. Mean scores on the LSHS-R were 8.38 during pregnancy and 5.24 postnatally. Hierarchical multiPLEs regression analyses revealed that ratings of depressive symptomatology significantly predicted PDI total score during pregnancy and LSHS-R total score postnatally, whilst postnatally, scores obtained on the PDI and LSHS-R postnatally were significantly predicted by scores on these measures during pregnancy. Fear in childbirth, but not in pregnancy, showed associations with PLEs but these associations were not maintained once multivariate analyses were conducted.Conclusions: The results of this study support the continuum model of psychosis, by illustrating that PLEs occur frequently in perinatal individuals without a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

AB  - Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) represent a growing population of patients. Medical and surgical advances have increased the number of CHD adult survivors, which may create quality-of-life (QOL) issues not previously considered. Quality-of-life issues pertinent to this patient population involve health and life insurance acquisition, birth control, genetic counseling, pregnancy concerns, employment, and independent living arrangements. The purpose of this study was to describe the QOL of adults with CHD. The study used a prospective cross-sectional case-control design to examine QOL using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). The study participants were a sample of 124 adults with CHD from an outpatient cardiology clinic in a metropolitan university-affiliated teaching hospital in the Northeast and 124 matched healthy control subjects. Between the participants and the matched control subjects, there was a significant difference in the total mean SIP score, the physical and psychosocial dimension scores, and all the category scores (P < 0.05). The areas of life the adults with CHD reported as lacking in quality involved the categories of work (SIP of 11.1, moderate disability) and sleep and rest (SIP of 9.03, mild disability). The results of this study indicate that the SIP can be used for quantitative and subjective QOL assessment of adults with CHD. It is suggested that cardiac advanced practice nurses use the results of this study to develop appropriate information, counseling, and anticipatory guidance for this patient population.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that neonatal sleep physiology reflects cerebral dysfunction, we compared neurologic examination scores to the proportions of recorded sleep/wake states, sleep depth, and sleep fragmentation in critically ill neonates.Methods: Newborn infants (≥35 weeks gestation) who required intensive care and were at risk for seizures were monitored with 8- to 12-hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination (Thompson) scores were calculated.Results: Twenty-eight infants participated (mean gestational age 39.0 ± 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho = 0.54, p = 0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p > 0.1). Higher state entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho = -0.43, p = 0.023). Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities were also related to examination scores.Conclusions: Among critically ill neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded sleep-including analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentation-showed associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.

AB  - This paper examines racial differences in trends and predictors of prone and lateral infant sleep positioning among South Carolina mothers and infants. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648 mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning (28.2-66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6-47.1%) than white infants. Compared to births in 2000-2005, births after the explicit recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position (2006-2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87) but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in sudden infant death syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present. The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity. METHODS: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic mother-child pairs were studied in a prospective study. Mother's reported child's race/ethnicity. The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4 years old that are known to be associated with child obesity. RESULTS: In multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01 for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4 months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic); and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black, 7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black, 3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for obesity exist prenatally and in early childhood. Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity may be determined by factors that operate at the earliest stages of life.

AB  - Objectives Whether racial/ethnic differences in prevalence/reporting of sleep disorders exist in pregnant women/women of child-bearing age is unknown. Study objectives were to estimate prevalence of sleep disorders and to examine racial/ethnic differences in sleep disorders, reporting of sleep issues, and amount of sleep among women of child-bearing age (15-44 years) in the US. Methods Through a secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010 (3175 non-pregnant, 432 pregnant women in main analysis), prevalence of sleep disorders, reporting of sleep disorders to a physician/health professional, and amount of sleep were estimated overall, by pregnancy status, and by race/ethnicity stratified by pregnancy status. Racial/ethnic differences in reporting of trouble sleeping by pregnancy status were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among women of childbearing age was 4.9 % [3.9 % pregnant; 5.1 % non-pregnant ( p < 0.01)]. Significantly fewer pregnant and non-pregnant minority women reported adequate sleep (7-8 h) than non-Hispanic white (white) women ( p < 0.05). Among non-pregnant women, odds of report of trouble sleeping were significantly higher for white compared to black (aOR 0.47 [95 % CI 0.36, 0.61]) or Mexican-American women (aOR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.21, 0.41]); non-pregnant minority women were also significantly less likely to report trouble sleeping than white women when controlling for amount of sleep. Among pregnant women, these same trends were found. Discussion Compared to white women, minority women, despite reporting less adequate sleep, are less likely to report trouble sleeping, providing evidence of an important health disparity.

T2  - Maternal & Child Health Journal
AB  - Introduction Although home-visiting programs typically engage families during pregnancy, few studies have examined maternal and child health outcomes during the antenatal and newborn period and fewer have demonstrated intervention impacts. Illinois has developed an innovative model in which programs utilizing evidence-based home-visiting models incorporate community doulas who focus on childbirth education, breastfeeding, pregnancy health, and newborn care. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the impact of doula-home-visiting on birth outcomes, postpartum maternal and infant health, and newborn care practices. Methods 312 young (M = 18.4 years), pregnant women across four communities were randomly assigned to receive doula-home-visiting services or case management. Women were African American (45%), Latina (38%), white (8%), and multiracial/other (9%). They were interviewed during pregnancy and at 3-weeks and 3-months postpartum. Results Intervention-group mothers were more likely to attend childbirth-preparation classes (50 vs. 10%, OR = 9.82, p < .01), but there were no differences on Caesarean delivery, birthweight, prematurity, or postpartum depression. Intervention-group mothers were less likely to use epidural/pain medication during labor (72 vs. 83%; OR = 0.49, p < .01) and more likely to initiate breastfeeding (81 vs. 74%; OR = 1.72, p < .05), although the breastfeeding impact was not sustained over time. Intervention-group mothers were more likely to put infants on their backs to sleep (70 vs. 61%; OR = 1.64, p < .05) and utilize car-seats at three weeks (97 vs. 93%; OR = 3.16, p < .05). Conclusions for practices The doula-home-visiting intervention was associated with positive infant-care behaviors. Since few evidence-based home-visiting programs have shown health impacts in the postpartum months after birth, incorporating doula services may confer additional health benefits to families.

AB  - Aim: To determine whether respiratory support via heated humidified high flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) results in infants <32weeks gestation spending a greater proportion of time in sleep compared to those receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP).Methods: A subgroup of infants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to compare HHHFNC or NCPAP post-extubation had sleep and wake activity measured by actigraphy for 72hours post-extubation. Activity diaries were completed contemporaneously to record episodes of infant handling. Actigraphy data were downloaded with known periods of handling excluded from the analysis.Results: 28 infants with mean gestation of 28.3weeks (SD 2) and birth weight 1074g (SD 371) were studied. Infants receiving HHHFNC spent a lesser proportion of time in sleep 59.8% (SD 18.5) than those on NCPAP 82.2% (SD 23.8) p=0.004. Infants receiving HHHFNC had a lower sleep efficiency and higher mean activity score than those on NCPAP (p=0.003, p=0.002, respectively).Conclusion: Infants receiving HHHFNC had a higher mean activity score and spent less time in sleep than those allocated NCPAP. Further study of sleep wake activity in preterm infants receiving respiratory support is required as this may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infants are at risk of overweight. Infant overweight predisposes child, adolescent, and adult to obesity. We hypothesized that parent education, initiated prenatally and provided in the home, would reduce the incidence of infant overweight at age 12 months. METHODS: Pregnant obese Latina women were recruited at Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and randomized to intervention versus control. Intervention subjects received home visits by trained Spanish-fluent community health workers who provided counseling on infant growth, breastfeeding, nutrition, child development, sleep, physical activity, and safety. Promotoras did not visit the control subjects. A research assistant collected outcome data on all subjects. RESULTS: Compared to controls, parent education did not reduce infant overweight. Infant overweight developed rapidly and was present in 46% of infants by age 6 months. Infants overweight at 6 months were likely to be overweight at age 12 months (r = 0.60, P < .0001). Overweight was more common in formula-fed infants at ages 6 months (P < .06) and 12 months (P = .005). Breastfeeding was less common in families with employed mothers (P = .02) and unemployed fathers (P < .01), but the father living with the mother at the time of the prenatal visit predicted successful breastfeeding at infant age 2 months (P < .003). Compared to formula feeding, overweight at age 12 months was 2.7 times less likely for infants breastfed for ≥2 months (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of success of the intervention may be explained in part by a high cesarean section rate in the intervention group, food and employment insecurity, and confounding by WIC breastfeeding promotion, which was available to all mothers. Breastfeeding was the most important mediator of infant overweight. The study supports efforts by WIC to vigorously promote breastfeeding.

AB  - Background: Young adulthood is a critical life period for health and health behaviours. Related measurements collected before and after birth, and during childhood and adolescence can provide a life-course analysis of important factors that contribute to health and behaviour in young adulthood. The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study has collected a large number of such measurements during the fetal, perinatal, infancy, childhood and adolescence periods and plans to relate them to common health issues and behaviours in young adults, including spinal pain, asthma, sleep disorders, physical activity and sedentary behaviour and, work absenteeism and presenteeism. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, design and methods of the 22 year follow-up of the Raine Study cohort. Methods/design: The Raine Study is a prospective cohort study. Participants still active in the cohort (n = 2,086) were contacted around the time of their 22nd birthday and invited to participate in the 22 year follow-up. Each was asked to complete a questionnaire, attend a research facility for physical assessment and an overnight sleep study, wear activity monitors for a week, and to maintain a sleep and activity diary over this week. The questionnaire was broad and included questions related to sociodemographics, medical history, quality of life, psychological factors, lifestyle factors, spinal pain, respiratory, sleep, activity and work factors. Physical assessments included anthropometry, blood pressure, back muscle endurance, tissue sensitivity, lung function, airway reactivity, allergic status, 3D facial photographs, cognitive function, and overnight polysomnography. Discussion: Describing the prevalence of these health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will enable better recognition of the issues and planning of health care resources. Providing a detailed description of the phenotype of these issues will provide valuable information to help educate health professionals of the needs of young adults. Understanding the life-course risk factors of health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will have important health planning implications, supporting the development of targeted interventions to improve current health status and reduce the onset and development of further ill-health across adulthood.

AB  - Changes in prenatal care practices resulted from a pilot study with 12 urban New Mexican women who received no prenatal care. The women were interviewed regarding their reasons for not receiving care during pregnancy, health behaviors, and perceived neonatal outcomes. Data on actual neonatal outcomes were taken from the medical record. Maternal reasons for no prenatal care were socio-demographic, system- related, attitudinal, and outside forces of job and childcare. To ensure a healthy baby, the women made changes in their nutrition, self-care activities, substance use, sleep, and exercise activities. All of the women perceived they had a healthy baby. Yet 61 % of the neonates had complications and 45% were low birth weight. The research findings were used to develop a care management program that included case management and utilization management.

TI  - Recent clinical and translational advances in pediatric hypertension.
AU  - Falkner, Bonita
T2  - Hypertension (0194911X)
AB  - Epidemiological reports describe a child population increase in BP level and an increase in prevalence of hypertension, that is largely, but not entirely, driven by a concurrent increase in childhood obesity. Given current estimates, ≈10% of adolescents have hypertension or prehypertension. In addition to obesity, dietary salt intake and waist circumference, a marker of visceral obesity, are found to be independently associated with the rise in BP among children and adolescents. Dietary salt intake in urban children is well above recommended levels largely because of consumption of processed and fast foods. Childhood exposures, such as stress,52 salt, and fructose, as well as lifestyles, including food sources, sleep patterns, and reductions in physical activity may have a role in obesity-high BP associations. In addition, clinical and translational evidence is mounting that intrauterine exposures alter can effect changes in fetal development that have an enduring effect on cardiovascular and metabolic function later in life. These effects can be detected even in children who are products of a term otherwise normal pregnancy. Hypertension in childhood has been defined statistically (BP ≥ 95th percentile) because of lack of outcome data that links a BP level with heightened risk for future cardiovascular events. Therefore, primary hypertension had been considered a risk factor for later hypertension in adulthood. Intermediate markers of TOD, including cardiac hypertrophy, vascular stiffness, and increases in cIMT, are detectable in adolescents with primary hypertension. Evidence that vascular injury is present in the early phase of hypertension and even in prehypertension warrants consideration on the current definition of pediatric hypertension. With further studies on TOD and other risk factors in addition to high BP, it may be possible to shift from a statistical definition to a definition of childhood hypertension that is evidence based. Preventing or reducing childhood obesity would have substantial benefit in countering the documented increase in BP levels and prevalence of high BP in childhood. Weight control in overweight and obese children, along with dietary changes 53 and increases in physical activity,54 has benefit on BP levels in childhood. Prevention of childhood obesity and BP risk will require multiple levels of intervention, including public health, health policy, and attention to food supply to foster the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent and reduce childhood obesity.

AB  - Objective: We sought to evaluate the impact of short sleep duration (SSD) and frequent snoring (FS) on glucose metabolism during pregnancy.Study Design: We conducted a prospective cohort study of healthy nulliparas who participated in a sleep survey study. SSD was defined as <7 hours of sleep per night and FS, as snoring >or=3 nights per week. Outcomes included 1-hour oral glucose tolerance results and the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.Results: A total of 189 women participated; 48% reported an SSD and 18.5% reported FS. SSD and FS were associated with higher oral glucose tolerance values: SSD (116 +/- 31 vs 105 +/- 23; P = .008) and FS (118 +/- 34 vs 108 +/- 25; P = .04). Both SSD (10.2% vs 1.1%; P = .008) and FS (14.3% vs 3.3%; P = .009) were associated with a higher incidence of GDM. Even after controlling for potential confounders, SSD and FS remained associated with GDM.Conclusion: SSD and FS are associated with glucose intolerance in pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. To compare indicators of fetal outcome in pregnant women with self-reported frequent snoring vs those without snoring. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized screening and comparison between groups. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty pregnant women and 110 age-matched nonpregnant women. METHODS: Survey evaluating self-reported snoring. For the pregnant women, infant birthweight, APGAR scores, and other indicators of fetal outcome were obtained by record review. RESULTS: Frequent snoring was reported in 14% of the pregnant women vs 4% of the nonpregnant women (Chi2=6.2; df=1; p<0.05). The pregnant women who reported frequent snoring did not have deliveries resulting in infants with evidence of an increase in compromised outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent snoring is reported more often in pregnant than in nonpregnant women. Snoring mothers do not appear to be at increased risk for delivering infants with fetal compromise as might be expected with the concomitant occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea.

T2  - Journal of Medical Case Reports
AB  - Background: Holoprosencephaly is a rare spectrum of cephalic disorders resulting from a failure or incomplete division of the embryonic forebrain into distinct cerebral hemispheres. It is the most common brain malformation with an incidence of 1:250 during embryogenesis; however, owing to the associated high rates of spontaneous abortion the incidence is 1:16,000 among live deliveries. Pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly is complex and heterogeneous involving genetic abnormalities, teratogenic exposures, and syndromic associations. Among the teratogenic exposures, maternal diabetes is a well-established risk factor associated with a 200-fold increased incidence of holoprosencephaly.Case Presentation: We report a case of a delayed diagnosis of semilobar holoprosencephaly in a 12-month-old baby boy of African descent who presented to us with a history of global developmental delay, erratic sleep patterns, and poor weight gain. He was born to a type 1 diabetes mellitus mother at 39+ weeks by emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress and breech presentation. The baby weighed 2315 g and had Apgar scores of 6/10 and 8/10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. A physical examination done at 12 months of age revealed a small-for-age child with a developmental age of 2 months. He had normal facies but a neurological examination revealed hypotonia in all four limbs. The rest of systemic examination was unremarkable. Hematological and biochemical investigations revealed normal findings except for iron deficiency anemia. The child also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of his brain which revealed distinctive features of semilobar holoprosencephaly. He was treated for iron deficiency anemia with Hemovit syrup (ferric ammonium citrate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin, and zinc sulfate) 10 ml thrice daily, ferrous sulfate 10 mg once daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily, and multivitamin syrup 5 ml once daily. Furthermore, nutritional and genetic counseling was offered to his parents.Conclusions: In conclusion, although rare, holoprosencephaly is the commonest structural anomaly of the brain with a complex and multifactorial etiopathogenesis. It is prudent to diagnose it prenatally, classify its severity, and forge its prognosis so that parents are counseled early enough to make informed decisions especially where termination of pregnancy may be implicated.

TI  - Sensory development in the fetus, neonate, and infant: introduction and overview.
AU  - Graven SN
AU  - Browne JV
T2  - Newborn & Infant Nursing Reviews
AB  - The knowledge and understanding of the development of the sensory systems in the fetus, neonate, and infant have progressed and grown extensively in the past twenty to thirty years. This has been a result of the advances in technology for study of brain development and the sensory systems specifically. While the basic physcial structure of the sensory receptors (i.e. eyes, ears etc.) develops early in gestation, most of the neurosensory development occurs in the last sixteen to twenty weeks. The neurological processes are not accelerated by preterm birth. Preterm birth accelerates the maturation of the kidney, gastrointestinal, lung and cardiovascular function but does not alter the sequence or timing of neurodevelopment. The stresses and the environment of the Newborn Intesive Care Unit (NICU) play a major role in the altered neurodevelopment observed in preterm infants. The brain development in the fetus, neonate, and infant includes not just sensory systems but motor systems, social/emotional systems, and the cognitive systems. These systems are connected and integrated during development. The development of the brain, both structure and function, is shaped by the influence of four major factors or processes. These inlude (1) the genetic endowment and the epigenetic effects from the environment, (2) the endogenous or internal brain activity and sleep, (3) external experiences and stimulation of the sensory organs, and (4) the physical, chemical, sensory, and social/emotional environments. These factors operate on and influence the development of each of the brain systems. These effects depend on age and developmental level of the particular system. Many of the processes and stimulations needed to facilitate brain development can result in adverse effects if exposure is at the wrong time in development or the level of intensity is not appropriate. The NICU inviroment can have very adverse consequences for healthy nuerodevelopment. It is essential that the invironment of the fetus, neonate, infant be adapted and managed to provide for the healthy early brain development. This requires both a developmentally, supportive environment and developmentally appropriate care practices. Copyright © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to examine neonatal symptoms previously reported to be associated with exposure to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy in a group of infants exposed to antidepressants, using a prospective and controlled design. METHOD: A prospective case-control study recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27 women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about pregnancy and delivery complications. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying, jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for <3 h after a feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the special care nursery. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy is a risk factor for sleep disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Progesterone, one of the key hormones in pregnancy, a known respiratory drive stimulant, increases ventilation and may protect against OSA. We aimed to examine the relationship between circulating progesterone and OSA, after accounting for body weight and gestational age. Methods: A case control study was conducted of pregnant women with OSA and those at low risk for the disorder. Cases were identified by ICD-9 code and review of medical record. Controls were identified if they scored zero (never) for snoring, apnea, and gasping on the multivariable apnea prediction index questionnaire immediately following delivery. Subjects with available stored first and/or second trimester residual serum samples were then included in this study and serum analyzed for progesterone. Raw progesterone levels were adjusted for the effects of gestational age and maternal weight. Results: Twenty-seven cases and 64 controls with available serum were identified. Women with OSA had greater maternal weight and higher rates of related comorbidities, compared to controls. Progesterone levels correlated positively with gestational age and negatively with greater weight. Progesterone levels, adjusted for gestational age and maternal weight and expressed as multiples of median (MoM), were significantly lower in OSA cases compared to controls in both the first trimester (MoM = 0.71, confidence interval [95% CI] 0.60-0.83) relative to the MoM in controls of 1.00. In the second trimester levels were also lower in OSA cases (MoM = 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96) compared to the MoM of 1.00 in controls. Conclusions: Progesterone levels, after accounting for weight and gestational age, were lower in women with OSA than controls. Progesterone may play a protective role against OSA.

AB  - Study Objective:Changes in sleep-disordered breathing associated with late pregnancy have not previously been systematically investigated; however, a number of case reports indicate exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea in late pregnancy, often in association with maternal hypertension. We aimed to compare the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated maternal blood-pressure responses in late pregnancy with the nonpregnant state.Design:Case-controlled, longitudinal study of sleep-disordered breathing during late pregnancy and postpartum.Study Patients:Ten women referred for suspected sleep-disordered breathing during the third trimester of pregnancy.Interventions:None.Measurements and Results:Full overnight polysomnography and continuous systemic blood pressure were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and 3 months following delivery. Parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, including apnea hypopnea index and minimum overnight arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, were compared between antenatal and postnatal studies. An improvement in both apnea-hypopnea index and minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation occurred consistently in all subjects postnatally. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, mean apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 63 +/- 15 per hour antenatally to 18 +/- 4 per hour postnatally (P = .03), and in rapid eye movement sleep, from 64 +/- 11 per hour to 22 +/- 4 per hour (P = .002). Minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was increased from 86% +/- 2% antenatally to 91% +/- 1% postnatally (P = .01). Arterial blood-pressure responses to apnea peaked at 170 to 180 mm Hg antenatally, while they only peaked at 130 to 140 mm Hg postnatally.Conclusion:This study indicates that late pregnancy may be associated with increased severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated blood-pressure responses.

AB  - Background: Excessive sleep fragmentation (SF) is common in pregnant women. Adult-onset metabolic disorders may begin during early development and exhibit substantial sex dimorphism. We hypothesized that metabolic dysfunction induced by gestational SF in male mice would not be apparent in female littermates.Methods: Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly in male and female offspring after late gestational SF or control sleep (SC). At 20 weeks, plasma leptin, adiponectin, lipid profiles, and insulin and glucose tolerance tests were assessed. Leptin and adiponectin, M1, and M2 macrophage messenger RNA expression and polarity were examined. Adiponectin gene promoter methylation levels in several tissues were assessed.Results: Food intake, body weight, visceral fat mass, and insulin resistance were higher, and adiponectin levels lower in male but not female offspring exposed to gestational SF. However, dyslipidemia was apparent in both male and female offspring exposed to SF, albeit of lesser magnitude. In visceral fat, leptin messenger RNA expression was selectively increased and adiponectin expression was decreased in male offspring exposed to gestational SF, but adiponectin was increased in exposed female offspring. Differences in adipokine expression also emerged in liver, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. Increased M1 macrophage markers were present in male offspring exposed to SF (SFOM) while increased M2 markers emerged in SF in female offspring (SFOF). Similarly, significant differences emerged in the methylation patterns of adiponectin promoter in SFOM and SFOF.Conclusion: Gestational sleep fragmentation increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in male but not in female offspring, most likely via epigenetic changes. Thus, sleep perturbations impose long-term detrimental effects to the fetus manifesting as sex dimorphic metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

AB  - Background: Varying work schedules are suspected of increasing risks to pregnant women and to fetal wellbeing. In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm disruption might impair fetal growth or lead to complications of pregnancy. Two independent meta-analyses (from 2000 to 2007) reported a small adverse effect of shift work on the risk of preterm delivery (PTD). However, these reviews were based on few high-quality studies.Objectives: To provide an updated review of the associations of shift work with PTD, low birthweight (LBW), small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and pre-eclampsia.Search Strategy and Selection Criteria: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE using combinations of keywords and MeSH terms.Data Collection and Analysis: For each relevant paper we abstracted standard details, used to summarise design features and rate methodological quality. We calculated pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) in random-effect meta-analyses.Main Results: We retrieved 23 relevant studies. The pooled estimate of RR for PTD was 1.16 (95% CI 1.00-1.33, 16 studies), but when five reports of poorer methodological quality were excluded, the estimated RR decreased to 1.03 (95% CI 0.93-1.14). We also observed increased RRs for LBW (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93-1.74) and for SGA (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22), which varied little by study quality. Little evidence was found on pre-eclampsia.Conclusions: These findings suggest that overall, any risk of PTD, LBW, or SGA arising from shift work in pregnancy is small.

AB  - Short sleep duration has been linked to maternal hyperglycemia. Systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and hyperglycemia in pregnancy or gestational diabetes (GDM). MEDLINE and Scopus were searched until July 2017. Studies that assessed sleep duration and had objective measurements of hyperglycemia during pregnancy were eligible. Aggregate data were available from eight studies, n = 17,308 (seven with self-reported and one with objectively measured sleep duration). Meta-analysis was applied for pooling aggregate data using a random-effects model. Identified authors provided individual patient data (IPD) from four studies with objectively measured sleep duration, n = 287. A one-stage approach with a hierarchical mixed-effect logit model was applied to pool IPD across studies. Aggregate data analysis revealed that women with short sleep duration (<6-7 h) were more likely to have GDM than women without short sleep duration, odds ratio 1.70 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.33). IPD analysis demonstrated that, compared to sleeping >6.25 h, women who slept ≤6.25 h had higher 1-h glucose levels after 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing by 0.65 mmol/L (0.18, 1.13) and an increased risk of GDM, adjusted odds ratio 2.84 (1.25, 6.44). In conclusion, short sleep duration in pregnancy, both self-reported and objectively measured, is associated with hyperglycemia and an increased GDM risk.

T2  - BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth
AB  - Background: Psychiatric disorders have been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints and disorders among pregnant women with psychiatric disorders.Methods: A cohort of 1,332 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We ascertained psychiatric diagnosis status and collect information about sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress. Logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Approximately 5.1% of the cohort (n=68) reported having a physician-diagnosis of mood or anxiety disorder before interview. Compared with women without a psychiatric diagnosis, the multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) for short sleep duration in early pregnancy (≤6 hours) were 1.95 (1.03-3.69). The corresponding OR (95%CI) for long sleep duration (≥9 hours) during early pregnancy was 1.13 (0.63-2.03). Women with psychiatric disorders had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR=2.41; 95%CI 1.46-4.00) and elevated perceived stress (OR=3.33; 95%CI 1.89-5.88). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight/obese women.Conclusions: Women with a psychiatric disorder were more likely to report short sleep durations, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent mood/anxiety-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the association between sleep duration in early pregnancy and fetal growth in a prospective cohort study of 3567 Chinese women.Methods: Pregnant women at 8-16 weeks of gestation were interviewed using a semi-quantitative questionnaire to assess sleep duration. Birth weight and birth length were measured by a midwife in the delivery room at birth; low birth weight (LBW) was defined as birth weight <2500 g and small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as <10th customized centile.Results: The average age of participants was 28.21 ± 3.38 years old. The mean sleep duration was 8.39 ± 1.13 h/day. A total of 1290 women sleeping ≥9 h/day, 1563 sleeping 8 to <9 h/day, 550 sleeping 7 to <8 h/day, and 164 sleeping <7 h/day. Compared to the sleeping 8 to <9 h/day group, birth length and birth weight of the sleeping <7 h/day group decreased by 2.42 mm (95% CI: -4.27, -0.58, p = 0.010) and 42.70 g (95% CI: -103.02, 17.62, p = 0.165), respectively; and risk of LBW and SGA of the sleeping <7 h/day group increased by 83% (95% CI: 0.59, 5.73, p = 0.297) and 56% (95% CI: 0.84, 2.92, p = 0.159), respectively; birth length of the sleeping <7 h/day group was decreased more in male babies, and among mothers without a midday napping habit or with a history of abortion (all p for interaction <0.05).Conclusions: Shorter sleep duration in early pregnancy was associated with birth length. Our findings indicate that midday napping may be a protective factor for birth length among pregnant women with shorter sleep duration.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep contributes to the developmental problems seen in preterm infants. We evaluated sleep problems in preterm infants 6 months of post-gestational age using the subjective Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and objective sleep tests. We also compared the sleep of premature infants with that of full-term infants.Methods: The study included 68 6-month-old full-term healthy infants and 191 premature infants born at <37 weeks gestation. All parents completed the BISQ-Chinese version and sleep diaries. At the same time, all premature infants were submitted to one night of polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory and also were set up with an actigraph kept for 7 days. Statistical analyses were performed using correlation coefficients and the t-test with SPSS version 18 to compare questionnaire responses with other subjective and objective measures of sleep.Results: The sleep problems indicated in the subjective questionnaire for the premature infants, particularly: "the nocturnal sleep duration, number of night awakenings, daytime sleep duration, duration of time with mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing" had significant correlations with sleep diaries, actigraphy and PSG results. The BISQ showed that duration of infant's sleeping on one side, nocturnal sleep duration, being held to fall asleep, number of nighttime awakenings, daytime sleep duration, subjective consideration of sleep problems, loud-noisy breathing, and duration spent crying during the night were significantly different between the premature infants and the term infants. PSG confirmed the presence of a very high percentage (80.6%) of premature infants with AHI > 1 event/hour as indicated by the questionnaire.Conclusion: Premature infants have more sleep problems than full-term infants, including the known risk of abnormal breathing during sleep, which has been well demonstrated already with the BISQ-Chinese (CBISQ).

T2  - Sleep
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: (1) To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for postpartum maternal sleep problems and depressive symptoms simultaneously, (2) identify factors independently associated with either condition, and (3) explore associations between specific postpartum sleep components and depression. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Population-based. PARTICIPANTS: All women (n = 4191) who had delivered at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2005 to September 2006 were mailed a questionnaire seven weeks postpartum. The response rate was 68% (n = 2830). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The prevalence of sleep problems, defined as PSQI > 5, was 57.7%, and the prevalence of depression, defined as EPDS > or = 10, was 16.5%. The mean self-reported nightly sleep duration was 6.5 hours and sleep efficiency 73%. Depression, previous sleep problems, being primiparous, not exclusively breastfeeding, or having a younger or male infant were factors associated with poor postpartum sleep quality. Poor sleep was also associated with depression when adjusted for other significant risk factors for depression, such as poor partner relationship, previous depression, depression during pregnancy and stressful life events. Sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality were the aspects of sleep most strongly associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep was associated with depression independently of other risk factors. Poor sleep may increase the risk of depression in some women, but as previously known risk factors were also associated, mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression are not merely reporting symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation.

T2  - Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience
AB  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are recognized as times of vulnerability to mood disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis. Recently, changes in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review what is known about changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum 'blues,' depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited. Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period, particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders.

T2  - Current Opinion in Psychiatry
AB  - Purpose Of Review: The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is the increased risk for sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence to suggest that women with significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, are more likely to report an increase in depressive symptomatology or develop postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD.Recent Findings: Symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep quality are independently associated with greater depressive symptoms across pregnancy and throughout postpartum. Likewise, both can negatively impact the ability to mother effectively.Summary: The presence of insomnia or sleep disturbance during the perinatal period is a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Women with depression are at an increased risk of developing sleep disturbance thereby increasing depressive symptomatology. This bidirectional and additive relationship needs more clinical attention as both sleep disturbance and depression are noted risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - An area that is often overlooked in the assessment of pregnant women is that of sleep. Women experience various forms of sleep changes during the perinatal period that are specific to the different trimesters. The literature suggests that sleep changes and resulting sleep deficits impact pregnant women in numerous ways, including both the physiological and psychological domains. Importantly, mood alterations associated with poor sleep quality can manifest as anxiety and depression. This article reviews sleep changes associated with pregnancy, highlights some outcomes that can occur from sleep disturbances, and suggests some interventions to promote improved sleep quality in pregnant women.

AU  - Haney, Alyssa

AB  - Sleep disturbances in the general population are associated with elevated blood pressure. This may be due to several mechanisms, including sympathetic activation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbance. Elevated blood pressure in pregnancy can have devastating effects on both maternal and fetal health and is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia and poor delivery outcomes. Preliminary evidence suggests that mechanisms linking sleep and blood pressure in the general population may also hold in the pregnant population. However, the effects of disturbed sleep on physiologic mechanisms that may directly influence blood pressure in pregnancy have not been well studied. The role that sleep disturbance plays in gestational blood pressure elevation and its subsequent consequences warrant further investigation. This review evaluates the current literature on sleep disturbance and elevated blood pressure in pregnancy and proposes possible treatment interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder that remains underdiagnosed in adult females. The Berlin Questionnaire is a validated tool for identifying people at risk for OSAS. The aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of OSAS in women and to estimate the risk for OSAS among females in the United States. METHODS: This is an analysis of data from the 2007 Sleep in America Poll of the National Sleep Foundation. The NSF Poll is an annual telephone survey of a representative sample of U.S. adults. The 2007 NSF Poll included 1254 women in the United States, with an oversample of pregnant and postpartum women. We used the Berlin Questionnaire to estimate the risk for OSAS among the U.S. female population. This instrument includes questions about self-reported snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and obesity. Also included were questions about sleep habits, sleep problems, menstrual cycle status, and other medical disorders. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of the female population was found to be at high risk for OSAS. Among women at high risk, such common symptoms of OSAS as habitual snoring (61%), observed apneas (7%), and daytime sleepiness (24%) were highly prevalent. Sleep onset insomnia (32%) or maintenance insomnia symptoms (19%) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms (33%) or body movements (60%) also were frequently reported. The risk increased with age (p < 0.05), obesity (p < 0.001), and menopause (p < 0.001). The presence of chronic medical disorders was more frequently reported among women at high risk. CONCLUSIONS: One in four women in America is at high risk of having OSAS. Awareness by the primary care medical community of this disorder in females should thus be increased.

AB  - Introduction: We have previously reported1 that of our patients older than 65 years, only three out of 70 individuals did not void at night. Eighty percent of our patients reported being bothered by their nocturia episodes1. Despite distress caused by nocturia, patients often consider the symptom to be trivial and not worth raising during a medical consultation.2-3 Nocturia is associated with sleep disturbance and is known to produce daytime fatigue, impair cognitive function and psychomotor performance, and to compromise safety. A significant relationship exists between daytime sleepiness and falls. In a review of causality of nocturia, we noted that severity of nocturia was associated with greater impairment on a global sleep assessment, frequency and degree of snoring and increased drowsiness. Obstructive sleep apnoea in women was a significant predictor of nocturia ≥ 2 (OR 4.99 95% CI 2.49-10.0). Snoring was reported to have the highest sensitivity for nocturia in men and second highest after obesity in women. Insomnia and restless leg syndrome were both independently predicted by nocturia.4 The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between validated sleep measures and frequency of nocturia in patients attending a continence service for help with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). A secondary aim was to identify key sleep variables that should be collected in all patients with co-existing nocturia. Materials & method: A nested dataset from 94 continence patients completing the TANGO Long Form, a self-completed 56-item nocturia questionnaire, was used for this study. Inclusion criteria were nocturia at least once per night and age 40 years or older. Individuals with conditions associated with atypical nocturia were ineligible for inclusion i.e. being medically unstable, receiving end-of-life-care, terminal malignancies, end stage renal disease, bladder cancer, previous pelvic radiotherapy and pregnancy. Individuals with dementia or cognitive impairment that precluded completing a questionnaire were also ineligible. Data were entered into SPSS (V23) and stratified by severity of nocturia. Discriminating items from the Insomnia Severity Index, Stop-Bang Obstructive Sleep Apnea metric along with the entire Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index were inspected for frequency of endorsement. Values were compared to community based norms. General health and mobility were captured by the EQ-5D-3L Health Status questionnaire and the SF-36 Health Status item. Items with a high "floor effect", i.e. >70% of responders endorsed "never" or its equivalent, where > 50% data was missing or with an inter-relationship >0.8 were identified. Severe nocturia, i.e. three or more episodes per night, was modelled using the sleep variables in order to identify any significant or independent predictors. Results: Table 1 (Table 1: Demographic and sleep characteristics stratified by nocturia severity.) shows the demographic information and sleep characteristics stratified by frequency of nocturia. Most sleep variables did not differ between mild and severe nocturia. Significant differences were seen in regular sleep latency beyond 30 minutes, insomnia, overall sleep quality and length of time to the initial nocturia episode. The symptoms of daytime urinary urgency and urge incontinence were significantly more prevalent in nocturia of >3 per night compared to <2. Regression analysis on the number of nocturia episodes explained 37% of the variance and retained the following variables: sum of three insomnia index items (p=0.047), time to first nocturia episode (p=0.009), sudden urinary urgency daily (p=0.029). Conclusions: This study identifies information that can be used to address sleep co-morbidities in patients with nocturia. Sleep variables explain less than half of the variance of nocturia frequency in our population, meaning that waking at night is unlikely to be attributable only to sleep issues in continence patients. This is supported by the significance of urgency in the model. We suggest that clinicians routinely asking about sleep latency beyond 30 minutes, primary and secondary insomnia, and estimating whether the patient sleeps for at least three hours before the initial nocturia episode, will capture clinically relevant sleep dysfunction.

AB  - Objective: To describe sleep characteristics in high-risk antepartum inpatients. Design: Prospective descriptive design. Setting: Tertiary hospital in southern California. Participants: A convenience sample of 39 antepartum women. Methods: Data were collected from participants' medical records, questionnaires (General Sleep Disturbance Scale), actigraphy on days 3 to 4 after admission, and a sleep diary that included reasons for awakening and morning and evening fatigue ratings. Results: Week gestation ranged from 24 to 35 weeks. Sleep time varied from 310 to 492 minutes and averaged 6.7 hours/night. The women were awakened 9 to 32 times/night and averaged 18 awakenings. They napped an average of 124 minutes throughout the day. Women averaged 3.9 on the General Sleep Disturbance Scale when retrospectively considering 7 days before hospitalization and scored 4.1 when considering the current 3 days of hospitalization. In the diary, most rated their sleep quality as Fairly Good or Very Good (62%-71%), but 29% said Very Bad on night 2, and 38% said Very Bad on night 3. Conclusion: Frequent interruptions during the night do not allow for mothers to receive the restorative sleep they need.

AB  - Sleep deprivation is a significant health concern for the pregnant population. As the responsibilities of everyday life become the prominent focus for many pregnant women, sleep durations lessen. Consequently, poor sleep habits can cause neurological, behavioral, and biological mishaps to occur. Sleep deprivation has shown to increase inflammation, cause memory and cognitive impairments, decrease alertness, and increase the risk for premature labor. Research in the field goes on to suggest that sleep deprivation can influence poor mental health and behavioral outcomes. This review summarizes existing data on the effects of sleep deprivation within the pregnant population.

AB  - Sleep duration in the population has been declining. Women occupy an increasingly prominent place in the work force without reducing most of their responsibilities at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women's daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes. We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that sleep disorder diagnosis would be associated with increased risk of preterm birth and to examine risk by gestational age, preterm birth type, and specific sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep apnea, movement disorder, and other).Methods: In this observational study, participants were from a cohort of nearly 3 million women in California between 2007 and 2012. Inclusion criteria were women with singleton neonates liveborn between 20 and 44 weeks of gestation without chromosomal abnormalities or major structural birth defects linked to a hospital discharge database maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development and without mental illness during pregnancy. Sleep disorder was defined based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code (n=2,265). Propensity score matching was used to select a referent population at a one-to-one ratio. Odds of preterm birth were examined by gestational age (less than 34 weeks, 34-36 weeks, and less than 37 weeks of gestation) and type (spontaneous, indicated).Results: Prevalence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) was 10.9% in the referent group compared with 14.6% among women with a recorded sleep disorder diagnosis. Compared with the referent group, odds (95% CI, P value, percentage) of preterm birth were 1.3 (1.0-1.7, P=.023, 14.1%) for insomnia and 1.5 (1.2-1.8, P<.001, 15.5%) for sleep apnea. Risk varied by gestational age and preterm birth type. Odds of preterm birth were not significantly increased for sleep-related movement disorders or other sleep disorders.Conclusion: Insomnia and sleep apnea were associated with significantly increased risk of preterm birth. Considering the high prevalence of sleep disorders during pregnancy and availability of evidence-based nonpharmacologic interventions, current findings suggest that screening for severe presentations would be prudent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational hypertension (GH) is a newly recognized risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events later in life. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Recent research has suggested that women with GH may have an increased rate of SDB during pregnancy, but it is not known if this higher rate of SDB persists into the postpartum state. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether women with GH continue to have an increased rate of SDB compared to healthy pregnant women, after the physiologic changes of pregnancy resolve. METHODS: We previously studied women with GH and uncomplicated pregnancies with sleep questionnaires and level 1 polysomnography. Participants were invited to participate in repeat testing 1-2 years postpartum. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) differences were assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects (11 GH and 7 healthy) had complete follow-up data available for comparison with antepartum data. This group was representative of the initial antepartum cohort. Women with GH experienced a decrease in mean RDI from antepartum to postpartum (12.0 ± 12.3 vs 2.9 ± 2.9; P = 0.02). Healthy women did not experience the same change (2.8 ± 5.3 vs 2.1 ± 3.2; P = 0.81). Postpartum comparisons showed the mean RDI of women with GH had decreased to be similar to that of healthy women (P = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: SDB in women with gestational hypertension improved in the postpartum state to levels indistinguishable from our healthy subjects. This suggests that the physiologic effects of pregnancy may have had a pathologic role in the development of antepartum SDB in women with GH.

AB  - Background There is recent interest exploring the possible impact of sleep disordered breathing on the mechanisms of preeclampsia. A biomarker of preeclampsia, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, has come to prominence in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between continuous positive airway pressure treatment, sleep disordered breathing and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations during pregnancy. Methods A 38-year-old G1P0 presented at 20 + 5 weeks. She had a history of chronic hypertension. Sleep studies revealed she had sleep disordered breathing with an AHI of 7.3/h. She was commenced on continuous positive airway pressure. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations and blood pressure recordings were taken at various points during her pregnancy. Results She did not develop preeclampsia or require an escalation in her antihypertensives. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations rose 16% from a low baseline. She remained compliant with her continuous positive airway pressure. She progressed to birth a well, live, term baby. Conclusion Continuous positive airway pressure treatment controlled sleep disordered breathing in a high risk pregnant woman with chronic hypertension with no increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations.

AB  - The last few years have witnessed a number of publications linking sleep disordered breathing to adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in various populations. Associations with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and growth restriction have been consistent across many studies. Though the manuscripts reviewed here consist mostly of preliminary data and need further confirmation, the studies have highlighted new directions in the assessment of the impact of sleep disordered breathing and pregnancy, and paved the way for new fields of research in this area.

AB  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) which includes obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), has emerged as a risk factor for adverse maternal–foetal outcomes in pregnancy. Physiological changes of pregnancy predispose a woman ‘at risk’ towards developing SDB. The increasing incidence of OSA in pregnancy closely correlates with the population trends of obesity. Common screening tools validated in non-pregnant subjects including Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) are poor predictors of SDB in pregnancy. Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are linked with SDB. Preeclampsia and OSA share common pathological associations. It is unclear if one predisposes the other. Foetal morbidity includes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, low birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and Apgar score of less than seven at one minute. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a well-documented treatment of SDB in pregnancy and has been shown to reverse some of the adverse events. It becomes imperative to diagnose and manage this condition as OSA causes substantial morbidity in the untreated pregnant patient and foetus. Three short clinical cases and a literature review on SDB on pregnancy are presented.

AB  - Sleep disorders affect women differently than they affect men and may have different manifestations and prevalences. With regard to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), variations in symptoms may cause misdiagnoses and delay of appropriate treatment. The prevalence of OSA appears to increase markedly after the time of menopause. Although OSA as defined by the numbers of apneas/hypopneas may be less severe in women, its consequences are similar and perhaps worse. Therapeutic issues related to gender should be factored into the management of OSA. The prevalence of insomnia is significantly greater in women than in men throughout most of the life span. The ratio of insomnia in women to men is approximately 1.4:1.0, but the difference is minimal before puberty and increases steadily with age. Although much of the higher prevalence of insomnia in women may be attributable to the hormonal or psychological changes associated with major life transitions, some of the gender differences may result from the higher prevalence of depression and pain in women. Insomnia's negative impact on quality of life is important to address in women, given the high relative prevalence of insomnia as well as the comorbid disorders in this population. Gender differences in etiology and symptom manifestation in narcolepsy remain understudied in humans. There is little available scientific information to evaluate the clinical significance and specific consequences of the diagnosis of narcolepsy in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs or other limbs during periods of rest or inactivity and may affect as much as 10% of the population. This condition is more likely to afflict women than men, and its risk is increased by pregnancy. Although RLS is associated with impaired quality of life, highly effective treatment is available.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and may be influenced by a multitude of factors. Pregnancy physiology may predispose to sleep disruption but may also result in worsening of some underlying sleep disorders, and the de novo development of others. Apart from sleep disordered breathing, the impact of sleep disorders on pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes is poorly understood. In this article, we review the literature and discuss available data pertaining to the most common sleep disorders in perinatal women. These include restless legs syndrome, insomnia, circadian pattern disturbances, narcolepsy, and sleep-disordered breathing.

T2  - Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care
AB  - Background Poor sleep during pregnancy has been associated with poorer birth outcomes. High body mass index ( BMI) is often associated with poor sleep, but little is known about the relationship between gestational weight gain and sleep in late pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships of both gestational weight gain and pre-pregnancy BMI to objective and subjective measures of sleep during late pregnancy. Methods Pregnant women (n=128) were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth classes primarily serving low-income women. Their sleep (disruption and duration) was objectively assessed in their last month of pregnancy with 72 hours of wrist actigraphy monitoring. Their perceived sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pre-pregnancy and late pregnancy height and weight were assessed by self-report and used to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain, which were then grouped into standardized categories. Results Mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was 6.8 ± 3.1 (range 2-16). Sixty percent had excess gestational weight gain and it was associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, but was unrelated to objective measures of sleep duration and disruption. Pre-pregnancy BMI was unrelated to all sleep parameters. However, analyses of the interaction of pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain indicated that excess weight gain was associated with shorter sleep duration and more sleep disruption, but only among women who were overweight before pregnancy. Conclusion Pregnancy is an opportunity to promote long-term women's health with a better understanding of the relationship between weight management and healthy sleep habits.

T2  - Sleep Medicine
AB  - Background: Cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors are linked to increased morbidity. Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors.Methods: Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI)), were collected thrice from pregnant women (N=161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10-12 weeks), T2 (14-16 weeks) and T3 (18-20 weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were dichotomised using established clinical cut-offs.Results: BMI and BP significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL≥20 min had greater BMI than women without persistent SOL≥20 min prior to covariate adjustment at T1 and T2, but at T3 the BMI values converged. Similar results were observed for persistent WASO≥30 min. Persistently long WASO, as measured by actigraphy, was associated with elevated SBP, after controlling for covariates.Conclusions: Consistent with anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report substantial difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep during early pregnancy and this may augment the risk of higher BP and BMI. Understanding these relationships is important as CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for appropriate intervention.

AB  - Sleep disturbance is a typical complaint during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies of this phenomenon have not measured sleep in the last days of pregnancy as women transition into labor. Poor sleep can have potentially adverse effects on labor and delivery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of sleep obtained in the 5 days preceding childbirth, and the relationship between sleep in this time frame and both pain and fatigue during early labor. METHODS: Thirty-five nulliparous women were recruited from childbirth preparation classes. Sleep was measured with wrist actigraphy continuously until hospital admission for delivery. Participants completed self-report measures of pain and fatigue in early labor prior to hospital admission. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Most women experienced spontaneous labor onset during the night. Sleep quality deteriorated progressively over the last 5 days of pregnancy, and was the lowest on the night before hospital admission. This was the case even when labor was induced (40%). CONCLUSION: There was a significant relationship between the amount of sleep the night before hospitalization and pain perception in women with spontaneous labor onset. Results from this study can be used to advise women in late pregnancy about expected sleep patterns and measures to optimize sleep and rest.

AB  - Background: Migraine is associated with sleep disturbances in men and non-pregnant women. However, relatively little is known about sleep disturbances among pregnant migraineurs. We investigated sleep disturbances among pregnant women with and without history of migraine.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1324 women who were recruited during early pregnancy. Migraine diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep-related characteristics including sleep duration, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and other sleep traits. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Migraineurs were more likely than non-migraineurs to report short sleep duration (<6.5 hours) (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.02), poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.35-2.23), and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.12-2.02). Migraineurs were also more likely than non-migraineurs to report taking sleep medication during pregnancy (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.20-2.42). Associations were generally similar for migraine with or without aura. The odds of sleep disturbances were particularly elevated among pre-pregnancy overweight migraineurs.Conclusion: Migraine headache and sleep disturbances are common comorbid conditions among pregnant women.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compared sleep problems during pregnancy and sleep dissatisfaction 18 months after pregnancy in pregnant women with binge eating disorder (BED) symptoms and pregnant women without an eating disorder. DESIGN: Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Data were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth. All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester, women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth. Health care professionals should inquire about BED during pregnancy as it may be associated with sleep disturbances, in addition to the hallmark eating concerns.

AB  - Khat (Catha edulis) is a evergreen flowering shrub that is cultivated at high altitudes, especially in East Africa and the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula. The plant contains alkaloids, of which cathinone and cathine have structural similarity and pharmacological action similar to amphetamines. The leaves are, therefore, consumed in some regions as a psychoactive stimulant due to cultural beliefs and misperceptions on the health benefits of khat consumption. This resulted in a growing prevalence of khat consumption among pregnant women. The myriad of physiological changes associated with pregnancy impairs sleep and memory. Moreover, khat has also been shown to have adverse effects on memory and sleep. Therefore, its use during pregnancy may further aggravate those impairments. The purpose of this mini-review is to summarize the changes in sleep and memory during pregnancy and the evidence supporting a relationship between khat consumption and neurocognitive deficits and sleep dysfunctions. The misperceptions of beneficial effects of khat, the high prevalence of consumption among pregnant women, and the possibility of under-reporting of khat abuse do necessitate the development of alternative methodologies to identify cases of unreported khat abuse in pregnant women. It is proposed that screening for sleep problems and memory deficits may help identify under-reported cases of khat abuse in pregnant women.

AB  - Background Sleep disturbance, depression, and daytime sleepiness are among the most prevalent symptoms reported by women during pregnancy. However, available data on the association between sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women are sparse and methodological limitations have been acknowledged. The purpose of the study was to examine objective and self-reported sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in a group of healthy pregnant women. Methods A total of 274 third-trimester pregnant women wore a wrist actigraph continuously for 7 days to assess objective sleep quality and quantity. Self-reported sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI), with self-reported poor sleep quality defined as a PSQI score more than 5. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale ( CES-D) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to evaluate symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Results Sixty-four (23.4%) women were at risk for clinical depression and 69 (25.2%) had daytime sleepiness. Risk of clinically meaningful depressive symptomatology was significantly increased in women with objective total nighttime sleep less than 6 hours ( OR 2.53 [95% CI 1.26-5.08]) and self-reported poor sleep quality ( OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.74-6.30]), even after multiple adjustment. Neither objective nor self-reported sleep disturbances increased daytime sleepiness in this group of pregnant women. Discussion Both objective nighttime sleep less than 6 hours and self-reported poor sleep quality in healthy third-trimester pregnant women is associated with significant risks for clinical depression. Improving sleep would likely be associated with a reduction in depression symptom severity and an attenuation of the prevalence of depression in pregnant women.

AB  - Objective: To explore relationships among sleep disturbances, glucose tolerance, and pregnancy outcomes.Research Design and Methods: Four validated sleep questionnaires were administered to 169 pregnant women at the time of 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during the second trimester. Pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in 108 women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT).Results: Of the participants, 41% had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] >8); 64% had poor sleep quality; 25% snored frequently; 29% had increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB); 52% experienced short sleep (SS); 19% had both increased SDB risk and SS (SDB/SS); and 14% had daytime dysfunction. Reported sleep duration inversely correlated with glucose values from 50-g OGTT (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). Each hour of reduced sleep time was associated with a 4% increase in glucose levels. Increased likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was found in subjects with increased SDB risk (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI 1.2-7.4]), SS (2.4 [1.0-5.9]), SDB/SS (3.4 [1.3-8.7]), and frequent snoring (3.4 [1.3-8.8], after adjustment for BMI). Among NGT subjects, preterm delivery was more frequent in those with increased ESS (P = 0.02), poor sleep quality (P = 0.02), and SS (P = 0.03). Neonatal intensive care unit admissions were associated with increased ESS (P = 0.03), SDB/SS (P = 0.03), and daytime dysfunction (P < 0.01) in mothers.Conclusions: Pregnant women experience significant sleep disturbances that are associated with increased risk of GDM and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women with increased SDB risk, frequent snoring, and sleep duration of <7 h/night have increased risk of developing GDM.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of sleep disturbances during pregnancy with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. Methods: In this prospective study, 688 healthy women with singleton pregnancy were selected from three hospitals in Chengdu, China 2013–2014. Self-report questionnaires, including the sleep quantity and quality as well as exercise habits in a recent month were administered at 12–16, 24–28, and 32–36 weeks’ gestation. Data on type of delivery, gestational age, and the neonates’ weight were recorded after delivery. After controlling the potential confounders, a serial of multi-factor logistic regression models were performed to evaluate whether sleep quality and quantity were associated with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. Results: There were 382 (55.5%) women who had cesarean deliveries and 32 (4.7%) who delivered preterm. Women with poor sleep quality during the first (OR: 1.87, 95% CI [1.02–3.43]), second (5.19 [2.25–11.97]), and third trimester (1.82 [1.18–2.80]) were at high risk of cesarean delivery. Women with poor sleep quality during the second (5.35 [2.10–13.63]) and third trimester (3.01 [1.26–7.19]) as well as short sleep time (<7 h) during the third trimester (4.67 [1.24–17.50]) were at high risk of preterm birth. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery and preterm birth throughout pregnancy. Obstetric care providers should advise women with childbearing age to practice healthy sleep hygiene measures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess sleep patterns and prevalence of sleep disturbances during pregnancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design; prospective questionnaire. SETTING: Outpatient, private obstetric clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 127 consecutive patients, with women evaluated at one of four points in pregnancy, 8-12 weeks (n = 37), 18-22 weeks (n = 28), 25-28 weeks (n = 24), and 35-38 weeks (n = 38). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Questionnaire of sleep habits and sleep disturbances. RESULTS: A large percentage of the women experienced sleep disturbances during pregnancy, These problems included frequent night wakings, difficulty falling asleep, and symptoms of sleep apnea. Few differences in sleep patterns were found across pregnancy, although women were found to sleep more and nap more by the end of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, especially late in pregnancy.

AB  - In a prospective study of 247 pregnant Chinese women, the prevalence of sleep disturbances across pregnancy has been assessed using a set of validated questionnaires including the Sleep and Health Questionnaire (SHQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The frequency of self-reported snoring increased from 29.7% in the first trimester to 40.5% and 46.2% in the second and third trimesters, respectively, with an increase in the prevalence of moderate or severe snoring from 1% in the first trimester to 7.2% in the third trimester (P < 0.01). There was a higher frequency of moderate to severe snoring intensity among subjects with BMI >or=25 compared with those with BMI <25 kg/m(2) in the third trimester (20.8%vs 5.3%, P < 0.01). Subjective sleepiness, as determined by the ESS, increased significantly from 8.6 to 9.4 and 9.6 in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression are common during pregnancy. Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy.Methods: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181) groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained.Results: Depressed women had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values≤.05). However, the frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values≤.05).Conclusions: At 20 and 30 weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms.

AB  - Self-reported sleep disturbances and levels of vitality and fatigue were studied in a secondary analysis of 25 pregnant and 29 postpartum employed women. Results indicate that pregnant women have problems initiating and maintaining sleep, and postpartum women have problems maintaining sleep, but not falling asleep. The primary reason for midsleep awakenings was urinary frequency among the pregnant women, and child care responsibilities among the postpartum women. Chronic sleep disturbance was indicated by a greater percentage of postpartum women. Chronic sleep disturbance was indicated by a greater percentage of postpartum women who fell asleep easily, very few who felt highly energetic at work, and most who perceived a high level of fatigue during the past week. Even with these sleep disruptions, no differences occurred in the mean scores for perception of fatigue and vitality between the two groups. Clinicians can use these findings to educate women about some changes they may anticipate and how they might manage them during pregnancy and postpartum.

TI  - Sleep dreams of women in the childbearing years: a review of research.
AU  - Pass CM
T2  - Holistic Nursing Practice
AB  - Descriptions of dreams of women during pregnancy have appeared in the literature for more than a century. Daydreams and sleep dreams are differentiated. A review of the literature published during the last four decades uncovered a limited number of empirical articles. The general consensus is that the sleep dreams of pregnant women are indicative of their concerns regarding safety for self and for the expected child. The most recent information focuses on the use of groups to help pregnant women explore the content of their dreams.

AB  - Objective: To describe the relationship between objectively assessed sleep and blood glucose in a prospective cohort of women recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Methods: Women with GDM were enrolled immediately after attending a GDM education class. All patients were recruited during their first week of attempted dietary management of GDM. They were instructed on the use of a glucometer and on the principles of a GDM diet. Women wore an actigraph and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Glucose records were compared against the objective sleep data. Linear mixed model analysis was used to estimate the association of sleep duration on morning fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations.Results: Thirty-seven participants provided data for 213 sleep intervals that corresponded to at least one glucose reading. Sleep duration was negatively associated with fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations In analyses adjusted for age, gestational age, and body mass index, a 1-hour increase in sleep time was associated with statistically significant reductions in fasting glucose (-2.09 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.98 to -0.20) as well as postprandial glucose concentrations (lunch -4.62 mg/dL, 95% CI -8.75 to -0.50; dinner -6.07 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.40 to -2.73).Conclusion: Short sleep durations are associated with worsened glucose control in women with gestational diabetes. Educating women on healthy sleep and screening for and treating sleep disorders during pregnancy may have a role in optimizing blood glucose control in gestational diabetes.Level Of Evidence: II.

AB  - Objective Only 9 % of women with young children consume a high quality diet. The association between sleep duration and health may be U-shaped. We examined diet quality in relation to sleep duration among US women within 5 years of childbirth. Methods Data were from non-pregnant women aged 20-44 years within 5 years of childbirth who completed two 24-h dietary recalls (N = 896) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2012. Self-reported weekday/workday sleep duration was categorized as short (≤6 h), adequate (7-8 h), or long (≥9 h). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010, range 0-100) estimated overall and components of diet quality. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated the association between sleep duration and diet quality, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education. Results Thirty-four percent of women reported short, 57.1 % adequate, and 8.6 % long sleep duration. The average diet quality total score was 47.4 out of 100. Short sleep duration was not associated with diet quality. Long sleep duration was associated with lower quality diet (β = −4.3; 95 % CI −8.1 to −0.4), lower consumption of total fruit (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.1), whole fruit (β = −0.9; 95 % CI −1.6 to −0.2), and total protein (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.03), and higher consumption of empty calories (β = 2.2; 95 % CI −4.3 to −0.1). Conclusions for practice Future studies should examine the longitudinal association between sleep duration and diet quality among women following childbirth and whether interventions to improve sleep can enhance diet quality.

TI  - Sleep duration and disorders in pregnancy: implications for glucose metabolism and pregnancy outcomes.
AU  - O'Keeffe, M
AU  - St-Onge, M-P
T2  - International Journal of Obesity
AB  - Humans have an innate requirement for sleep that is intrinsically governed by circadian and endocrine systems. More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed.

AB  - Aims To examine the association between sleep disturbances during pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods From 2010 to 2012, 12 506 women in Tianjin, China, were screened using a 50-g 1-h glucose challenge test at 24-28 weeks' gestation. Those with glucose challenge test values of ≥ 7.8 mmol/l were invited to further undergo a 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational diabetes was determined according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group's definition. Self-reported sleep duration and sleep quality during pregnancy was documented using a modified questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios and 95% CIs. Results A total of 919 women (7.3%) had gestational diabetes. Sleep duration was found to have an approximate J-shaped association with gestational diabetes risk after adjusting for covariates. Compared with a sleep duration of 7-9 h/day (43% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios for sleep duration of ≥ 9 h/day (55%) and < 7 h/day (2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.21 (95% CI 1.03-1.42) and 1.36 (95% CI 0.87-2.14), respectively. Compared with good sleep quality (37.9% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios of moderate (59.9%) and poor sleep quality (2.2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.19 (95% CI 1.01-1.41) and 1.61 (95% CI 1.04-2.50), respectively. Conclusion In pregnant Chinese women, poor sleep quality, and shorter and longer duration of sleep during pregnancy were independently associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

TI  - Sleep duration in the United States: a cross-sectional population-based study.
AU  - Krueger PM
AU  - Friedman EM
T2  - American Journal of Epidemiology
AB  - Sleep duration is associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors, depression, automobile and workplace accidents, and prospective mortality. Little is known, however, about sleep patterns in the US population. The 2004-2007 National Health Interview Survey-Sample Adult Files provide nationally representative data for 110,441 noninstitutionalized US adults aged 18 years or older, and multinomial logistic regression examines whether variables in 5 domains-demographic, family structure, socioeconomic, health behavior, and health status-are associated with long or short sleep duration. Being older, non-Hispanic black, or a current or former smoker; having low levels of education, income, or few income sources; consuming few or numerous drinks in a week; or reporting cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, underweight, or activity limitations is associated with increased odds of both long and short sleep duration. Other variables are associated with shorter (e.g., living with young children, being unmarried, working long hours, more frequent binge drinking) or longer (e.g., being younger, Mexican American, pregnant, or having low levels of physical activity) sleep hours. The authors identify numerous risk factors for long and short sleep; many of those variables are potential confounders of the relation between sleep hours and other health outcomes.

AB  - Background: Migraine has been associated with sleep disorders in men and non-pregnant women, but little is known about sleep complaints among pregnant migraineurs.Methods: A cohort of 1,334 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. At the time of interview we ascertained participants' migraine diagnosis status and collected information about sleep duration before and during early pregnancy, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress during early pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of short/long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress associated with a history of migraine.Results: Approximately 19.4% of the cohort (n = 259) reported having a medical diagnosis of migraine prior to the study pregnancy. Compared with women without migraine, the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CI) among migraineurs for short sleep duration before and during early pregnancy were 1.51 (1.09-2.09), and 1.57 (1.11-2.23), respectively. The corresponding OR (95% CI) for long sleep duration before and during pregnancy were 1.33 (0.77-2.31) and 1.31 (0.94-1.83), respectively. A modest and statistically insignificant association between migraine history and excessive daytime sleepiness in early pregnancy was noted (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.94-2.26). Migraineurs had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.52-2.76) and elevated perceived stress (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.06-2.31). Observed associations were more pronounced among overweight migraineurs.Conclusions: These data support earlier research documenting increased risks of sleep disorders among migraineurs; and extends the literature to include pregnant women. Prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly explore factors that mediate the apparent migraine-sleep comorbidity among pregnant women.

AB  - Depression has been associated with sleep disturbances in pregnancy; however, no previous research has controlled the possible confounding effect of anxiety on this association. This study aims to analyze the effect of depression on sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy controlling for anxiety. The sample was composed by 143 depressed (n = 77) and non-depressed (n = 66) pregnant women who completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep. Differences between groups in sleep controlling for anxiety were found. Depressed pregnant women present higher number of nocturnal awakenings and spent more hours trying falling asleep during the night and the entire 24 h period. Present findings point out the effect of depression on sleep in late pregnancy, after controlling for anxiety.

AB  - Executive function deficits are among the most frequent sequela of very preterm birth but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep to assess alterations in the functional neuroanatomy of executive processes in adolescents born very preterm. The topographical distribution of sleep slow wave activity (SWA; 1-4.5 Hz EEG power) has previously been used to map cognitive abilities and is known to reflect the intensity of the prior use of the respective neuronal networks. We assessed 38 adolescents born before 32 weeks of gestation [age at assessment: 12.9 (SD: 1.7), range: 10.6-16.7 years] and 43 term-born peers [13.1 (2.0), 10.0-16.9]. Executive function abilities were quantified with a composite score derived from a comprehensive task battery. All-night high-density EEG (128 electrodes) was recorded and SWA of the first hour of sleep was calculated. Abilities were significantly poorer in the very preterm compared to the term-group, particularly, if the tasks demands were high (p < .01). The score was positively correlated with sleep SWA in a cluster of 15 electrodes over frontal and negatively in a cluster of 14 electrodes over central brain regions after controlling for age at assessment and correcting for multiple comparisons. Within the frontal cluster, sleep SWA was higher in very preterm compared to term-born participants when controlling for executive function performance and age at assessment (p = .02). No difference in SWA between very preterm and term-born participants was found for the central cluster (p = .29). Our results demonstrate a local increase of sleep SWA over brain regions associated with executive processes in adolescents born very preterm compared to similarly performing term-born peers. Thus, sleep SWA seems to map the higher effort needed for executive function tasks in adolescents born very preterm.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based cognitive-behavioral training program for sleep during late pregnancy.Methods: A nonrandomized quasiexperimental sample of nulliparous women who received the intervention during pregnancy (n=25) was compared with two control groups (n=76 and n=48) from other intervention studies at similar postintervention time points: approximately 1 month before childbirth and 1-2 months after childbirth. The home-based Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy consisted of 4 weeks of sound-enhanced audio relaxation programs, readings, and daily sleep diaries. Both control groups received dietary recommendations for improving sleep. Sleep duration (total sleep time) and sleep disruption (wake after sleep onset) were measured using wrist actigraphy for a minimum of 48 hours on consecutive weekdays.Results: The intervention group had significantly longer sleep duration and less sleep disruption than both control groups, particularly at the postpartum assessment. Intervention participants slept an average of 430 (95% confidence interval [CI] 397-464) minutes during pregnancy compared with 420 (95% CI 403-438) and 417 (95% CI 395-439) minutes for the two control groups. At the postpartum assessment, the intervention group slept 446 (95% CI 415-478) minutes compared with 390 (95% CI 373-408) and 370 (95% CI 348-393) minutes for those in the control groups. In terms of sleep disruption, women in the intervention group had 16.1% (95% CI 11.9-20.2%) wake after sleep onset during pregnancy, whereas women in the control groups had 13.4% (95% CI 11.2-15.5%) and 20.4% (95% CI 17.7-23.0%). Postpartum, the intervention group had 20.3% (95% CI 16.4-24.1%) wake after sleep onset compared with 26.6% (95% CI 24.5-28.8%) and 28.7% (95% CI 26.0-31.5%) among women in the control groups. Participant feedback about the intervention was generally positive, although intervention adherence was variable.Conclusion: This study provides evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of the Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy intervention for enhancing sleep that typically worsens during late pregnancy and after childbirth.

AU  - Erwin, Andrea M
AB  - For many women, pregnancy can be a time of sleep disturbance. Physiological, hormonal, and emotional changes associated with pregnancy often lead to sleep disturbance. Women who develop antepartum complications frequently are prescribed bed rest and hospitalization. Both pregnancy and hospitalization can influence sleep. This study examined the sleep experience of hospitalized antepartum women. The purposes of this descriptive correlational study were to determine whether being in the hospital affects sleep in pregnant women, gestational age influences sleep while hospitalized, and patient's usual sleep patterns influence sleep during hospitalization. A conceptual model of impaired sleep for the childbearing family provided theoretical guidance.A convenience sample of 24 pregnant women, 18-39 years of age, participated in the study. Most participants were unmarried minority women with annual incomes of less than $30,000. Difficulties in retaining participants to Day 4 were encountered; only 9 participants completed the study to Day 4.Most participants had existing sleep disturbances, according to PSQI and GSDS scores on admission. Women self-reported both internal and external factors that interrupted their sleep during hospitalization. There was a moderate, inverse relationship between the weeks of gestation and how well the participants slept the previous night on Day 3. Perceptions of sleep depth and sleep quality increased significantly over time. Self-reported difficulty in falling asleep the previous night significantly decreased over time.Recommendations for future research are modification of the design to include all women admitted and discharged prior to Day 4, larger sample size, and the use of objective and subjective measures in data collection.

AB  - Sleep fragmentation (SF) is a common condition among pregnant women, particularly during late gestation. Gestational perturbations promote the emergence of adiposity and metabolic disease risk in offspring, most likely through epigenetic modifications. Adiponectin (AdipoQ) expression inversely correlates with obesity and insulin resistance. The effects of SF during late gestation on metabolic function and AdipoQ expression in visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) of offspring mice are unknown. Male offspring mice were assessed at 24 weeks after dams were exposed to SF or control sleep during late gestation. Increased food intake, body weight, VWAT mass, and insulin resistance, with reductions in AdipoQ expression in VWAT, emerged in SF offspring. Increased DNMT3a and -b and global DNA methylation and reduced histone acetyltransferase activity and TET1, -2, and -3 expression were detected in VWAT of SF offspring. Reductions in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and H3K4m3 and an increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K9m2 in the promoter and enhancer regions of AdipoQ emerged in adipocytes from VWAT and correlated with AdipoQ expression. SF during late gestation induces epigenetic modifications in AdipoQ in male offspring mouse VWAT adipocytes along with a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype. Thus, altered gestational environments elicited by SF impose the emergence of adverse, long-lasting metabolic consequences in the next generation.

TI  - Sleep homeodynamics and wellbeing in asymptomatic HIV-seropositive African American women.
AU  - Gayton, Tabetha Lynn
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV--related sleep disruption is a common complaint of persons with HIV infection. With the demographical shifts, African American women have now emerged as one of the fastest growing HIV populations today, yet they remain a vulnerable and underrepresented population in the sleep literature.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the dynamics of HIV--related sleep disruption and wellbeing in asymptomatic HIV--seropositive AA women of childbearing age within the context of a holistic, theoretical substruction from Myra Levine's Conservation Model (1967). The rationale for the proposed study was to provide a foundation of both the objective and subjective experience of HIV--related sleep disruption, which as a stressor can affect wellbeing.METHODS: A descriptive correlational design was used to examine the immunological integrity, sleep/wake rhythm, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, IL--6 rhythm, and quality of life in 20 asymptomatic HIV--seropositive African American women receiving care at Wayne State University Physicians Group Infectious Diseases Clinic in Detroit, MI. In this 4--day protocol, measures included CD4+ cell count, HIV RNA viral load, wrist actigraphy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Subjective Sleep Quality Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, plasma IL--6, Quality of Life Index, and Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale.RESULTS: Both the objective and subjective experience of sleep demonstrated severe sleep disruption and disorganized sleep patterns. Nearly half (45%) of the sample slept < 6 hours per night, usually not falling asleep until sometime after 12 midnight. Objective daytime functioning was also disrupted with frequent dozing (> 9 sleep episodes) noted throughout the day. Self--reported daytime sleepiness was inconsistent with the objective assessment and was within normal limits. The sample's mean IL--6 level was 2.03 pg/mL, which is much lower than that reported in other asymptomatic samples or normal controls. Quality of life measures indicated a positive sense of wellbeing, but the daily pattern of quality of life was not associated with the daily pattern of sleep efficiency, subjective sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, or IL--6 levels when controlling for CD4+ cell count and HIV RNA viral load. And lastly, the 1--item quality of life scale showed agreement with the 66--item quality of life index using Bland--Altman agreement analysis, which may help in decreasing participant burden in clinical trials enrolling this population.CONCLUSION: This sample suffered from severe HIV-related sleep disruption, as evidenced by an average sleep time of 6.4 hours per night and frequent dozing throughout the day. Despite this disruption, the sample perceived a positive sense of quality of life. These results provide further evidence that future studies exploring efforts to improve sleep and daytime functioning in asymptomatic HIV-seropositive African American women are essential in order to maintain quality of life and wellbeing in this population.

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the associations of sleep hygiene and actigraphy measures of sleep with self‐reported sleep quality in 197 pregnant women in northern Taiwan. Third‐trimester pregnant women completed the Sleep Hygiene Practice Scale (SHPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) as well as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies‐Depression Scale (CES‐D), and wore an actigraph for 7 consecutive days. Student's t‐test was used to compare the SHPS scores and means as well as variability of actigraphy sleep variables between poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score >5) and good sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score ≤5). Compared to good sleepers, poor sleepers reported significantly worse sleep hygiene, with higher SHPS scores and higher sleep schedule, arousal‐related behavior, and sleep environment subscale scores. Poor sleepers had significantly greater intra‐individual variability of sleep onset latency, total nighttime sleep, and wake after sleep onset than good sleepers. In stepwise linear regression, older maternal age (p = .01), fewer employment hours per week (p = .01), higher CES‐D total score (p < .01), and higher SHPS arousal‐related behavior subscale scores (p < .01) predicted self‐reported global sleep quality. Findings support avoiding physically, physiologically, emotionally, or cognitively arousing activities before bedtime as a target for sleep‐hygiene intervention in women during pregnancy. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that fatigue and sleep disturbance in late pregnancy are associated with labor duration and delivery type. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective observational study of 131 women in their ninth month of pregnancy, objective (48-hour wrist actigraphy) and subjective (sleep logs and questionnaires) measures were used to predict labor outcomes using analysis of variance and logistic regression. RESULTS: Controlling for infant birth weight, women who slept less than 6 hours at night had longer labors and were 4.5 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Women with severely disrupted sleep had longer labors and were 5.2 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Fatigue was unrelated to labor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Health care providers should prescribe 8 hours of bed time during pregnancy to assure adequate sleep and should include sleep quantity and quality in prenatal assessments as potential predictors of labor Copyright © 2004 by Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - The article examines relationships between pregnancy and maternal sleep. Specifically, sleep as a restorative process is considered with regard for the metabolic and arousal demands of childbearing. The analysis draws attention to the limited number of studies in the area and the need for greater research interest in pregnancy sleep phenomena. The available evidence indicates that maternal slow-wave and rapid eye movement which are key to anabolic activity and neural-cerebral recharge, are protected throughout pregnancy until perhaps the last 3 to 4 weeks before delivery. The sleep disturbances about which term gravidas complain appear to be based on increased periods of wakefulness after sleep onset.

AB  - There are many ways in which women experience sleep differently from men. Women contending with distinct sleep challenges respond differently to sleep disorders, as well as sleep deprivation and deficiency, and face particular health outcomes as a result of poor sleep. Idiosyncrasies, including changes that occur with the biological life cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, make the understanding of sleep in women an important topic to study. Each phase of a woman's life, from childhood to menopause, increases the risk of sleep disturbance in unique ways that may require distinct management. Indeed, new research is unraveling novel aspects of sleep pathology in women and the fundamental role that sex hormones play in influencing sleep regulation and arousals and possibly outcomes of sleep conditions. Moreover, studies indicate that during times of hormonal change, women are at an increased risk for sleep disturbances such as poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, as well as sleep disorders such as OSA, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. This article reviews sleep changes in female subjects from neonatal life to menopause.

AB  - Sleep complaints are common in women, and women are more likely to suffer from insomnia than men. Multiple factors across a woman's lifespan, including hormonal changes, age-related physiological changes, psychosocial factors, the presence of sleep disorders, and physical and mental health conditions, can contribute to complaints of poor sleep in women. This article reviews the literature on the characteristics of, and contributing factors to, subjectively and objectively measured sleep during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and post-partum period, as well as the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Evidence from both subjective and objective measurements supports the presence of chronic sleep fragmentation associated with pregnancy, acute sleep deprivation during labour and the immediate post-partum periods, as well as disrupted sleep during the first few months after childbirth. While there is evidence for menstrual cycle and menopause related sleep disturbance based on women's self report, findings from objectively measured sleep have been mixed. Observational and intervention studies on the relationship between sleep and women's psychological well-being suggest that underlying causes of sleep disturbance across a woman's lifespan are often multi-factorial. Comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions are needed in managing sleep problems in women. Cognitive behavioural interventions have been shown to reduce sleep complaints during the perinatal and menopausal periods, and improvements in sleep are likely to lead to improvements in women's overall well-being.

AB  - Objective Greater acculturation is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in Mexican-American women, but the mechanisms by which acculturation influences perinatal outcomes are unclear. Pregnant acculturated Mexican-American women are more likely to engage in unhealthy prenatal behaviors relative to those less acculturated, including poor sleep. As sleep disruptions are associated with acculturation and negative perinatal outcomes, particularly maternal depression, alterations in sleep may adversely affect pregnant Mexican-American women. Methods Sixty pregnant women of Mexican descent completed surveys about sleep, acculturation, depressive symptoms and potential protective factor of social support. Results Acculturation, but not social support, significantly predicted increased sleep disruptions as well as overall feeling less refreshed upon waking across pregnancy. Moderation analysis indicated that more acculturated women who took longer to fall asleep reported increased depressive symptoms. Feeling refreshed upon waking also mediated the relationship between increased acculturation and elevated maternal depressive symptoms. Conclusions Acculturation and altered sleep contribute to greater risk in Mexican-American women for maternal depressive symptoms in the perinatal period. These findings have implications for prevention and treatment of maternal mental health disorders, which may adversely affect perinatal outcomes in the vulnerable Mexican-American population.

T2  - Biological Research for Nursing
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the sleep patterns and fatigue of both mothers and fathers before and after childbirth. The authors used wrist actigraphy and questionnaires to estimate sleep and fatigue in 72 couples during their last month of pregnancy and 1st month postpartum. Both parents experienced more sleep disruption at night during the postpartum period as compared to the last month of pregnancy. Compared to fathers, with their stable 24-h sleep patterns over time, mothers had less sleep at night and more sleep during the day after the baby was born. Sleep patterns were also related to parents' work status and type of infant feeding. Both parents self-reported more sleep disturbance and fatigue during the 1st month postpartum than during pregnancy. Mothers reported more sleep disturbance than fathers, but there was no gender difference in ratings of fatigue. At both time points, fathers obtained less total sleep than mothers when sleep was objectively measured throughout the entire 24-h day. Further research is needed to determine the duration of sleep loss for both mothers and fathers, to evaluate the effect of disrupted sleep and sleep loss on psychosocial functioning and job performance, and to develop interventions for improving sleep patterns of new parents.

AB  - Objective: To examine patterns of postpartum parental sleep and levels of fatigue at 2, 12, and 20 weeks following hospital discharge of newborn twins. Design: Descriptive longitudinal pilot study. Setting: Recruitment from 2 hospital postpartum units. Data collected in parents' homes. Participants: Eight primiparous parents caring for twins delivered at 33 to 38 weeks gestation. Methods: Home visits to deliver and retrieve study equipment: wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries to measure sleep, standardized instrument to measure fatigue, and an investigator-developed form to measure demographics and related variables. Results: Fathers had significantly less night sleep (5.4 hours) and less 24 hour sleep (5.8 hours) than mothers (6.2 and 6.9 hours, respectively) at 2 weeks after twins were discharged. Sleep efficiency increased significantly over time in a linear fashion for both parents. Morning and evening fatigue levels were not significantly different between parents and remained constant over time. Conclusion: Pilot data suggest that mothers and especially fathers of twins experience sleep disturbances after discharge of their twins. Further study is needed to more fully describe the evolution of sleep patterns and clarify factors that influence sleep in parents of twins.

AB  - Objective: This study sought to characterize sleep patterns and sleep problems in a large sample of women across all months of pregnancy.Methods: A total of 2427 women completed an Internet-based survey that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, vitality scale of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Berlin questionnaire, International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) question set, and a short version of the Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI).Results: Across all months of pregnancy, women experienced poor sleep quality (76%), insufficient nighttime sleep (38%), and significant daytime sleepiness (49%). All women reported frequent nighttime awakenings (100%), and most women took daytime naps (78%). Symptoms of insomnia (57%), sleep-disordered breathing (19%), and restless legs syndrome (24%) were commonly endorsed, with no difference across the month of pregnancy for insomnia, sleep-disorder breathing, daytime sleepiness, or fatigue. In addition, high rates of pregnancy-related symptoms were found to disturb sleep, especially frequent urination (83%) and difficulty finding a comfortable sleep position (79%).Conclusions: Women experience significant sleep disruption, inadequate sleep, and high rates of symptoms of sleep disorder throughout pregnancy. These results suggest that all women should be screened and treated for sleep disturbances throughout pregnancy, especially given the impact of inadequate sleep and sleep disorders on fetal, pregnancy, and postpartum outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Controversies exist regarding the impact of co-sleeping on infant sleep quality. In this context, the current study examined: (a) the differences in objective and subjective sleep patterns between co-sleeping (mostly room-sharing) and solitary sleeping mother-infant dyads; (b) the predictive links between maternal sleep during pregnancy and postnatal sleeping arrangement; (c) the bi-directional prospective associations between sleeping arrangement and infant/maternal sleep quality at three and six months postpartum.Methods: The sample included 153 families recruited during pregnancy. Data were obtained in home settings during the third trimester of pregnancy and at three and six months postpartum. Mothers were asked to monitor their own sleep and their infants' sleep for five nights using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Questionnaires were used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms.Results: Mothers of co-sleeping infants reported more infant night-wakings than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping group. Moreover, poorer maternal sleep during pregnancy and at three months postpartum predicted higher levels of co-sleeping at six months.Conclusion: Mothers of co-sleeping infants report more infant night-wakings, and experience poorer sleep than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. The quality of maternal sleep should be taken into clinical consideration when parents consult about co-sleeping.

TI  - Sleep patterns of women at risk for the development of preterm labor.
AU  - Strange LB
AB  - Prematurity, delivery prior to 37 weeks gestation, is the primary cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Extensive research on its prevention and management reveals that corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and cytokines play significant roles in the development of preterm labor. These substances also influence sleep, suggesting a possible, but previously unexplored, association between sleep pattern changes and preterm labor. Thus, in order to begin a systematic examination of this potentially important relationship, this study explored subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women.The Bi-Dimensional Stress Model, which describes the influence of physiological and psychosocial stress in stimulating the immune and endocrine responses associated with preterm birth, provided the theoretical framework for this study. The design consisted of a convenience sample of 220 subjects participating in a descriptive, prospective, comparative study. Subjects completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during routine antenatal visits in the second trimester of pregnancy. Delivery outcome data identified those subjects who delivered preterm.Sleep latency, a component of the PSQI and a measure of the period from 'lights out' to sleep onset, was longer in those who delivered preterm compared to those who delivered at term. The daytime dysfunction score, a component of the PSQI and a measure of problems with maintenance of alertness, was higher in those who experienced a term delivery. No differences were detected between the preterm and term groups in the total scores of the other primary variables (PSQI, ESS, and PSS), in the other sleep variables measured by the PSQI (sleep efficiency, total sleep time), or in the other component scores of the PSQI. The preterm group reported more cigarette smoking, previous preterm births, and experienced more twin gestations than the term group. However, only previous preterm birth and sleep latency were predictive of preterm birth.This study represents the first investigation to explore the potential relationship between sleep and preterm labor. Outcomes from this research suggest a possible, relationship between sleep onset insomnia and preterm birth. In addition, recommendations for further research are identified.

T2  - Sleep
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate sleep practices regarding maternal, infant, and socioeconomic factors in an infant population and to propose a scoring scale associated with high versus low risk of sudden infant death syndrome. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based study. SETTING: Passo Fundo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 2,285 newborns. INTERVENTIONS: Perinatal information was collected from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Application of the score allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age < or = 20 years (p < .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p < .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk sleep practices were widely observed in the study population. The significance of this study lies in the future application of this information via public health measures targeted at high-risk populations.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate and identify determinants of health related quality of life (HRQoL) during pregnancy. Pregnant women ( n = 245) completed questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey SF-36), life stress, social support, sleep, and depressed mood in the third trimester. Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems. Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed.

AB  - Studies indicate that sleep is disturbed throughout the maternity cycle. The sleep disturbance, leading to reduced sleep time, has been associated with a variety of physical, behavioral, and psychological problems. When these are superimposed on the normal pregnancy and child birth, the potential for altered health is increased. Nursing intervention to identify sleep deficit and promote sleep is required at all stages of the maternity cycle. A knowledge of sleep structure and the role of each stage of sleep is a prerequisite in understanding the value of sleep in health.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate sleep quality and health-related quality of life in pregnancy. In a cross-sectional design, 492 women (292 pregnant and 200 non-pregnant healthy controls) were included in this study between November 2014 and June 2015. Participants completed a survey on sociodemographic characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). The PSQI total and EQ-5D scores of pregnant women were significantly worse than the controls (P= .017 and P < .001, respectively). Linear regression analysis showed that only pregnancy status was related to PSQI scores (/5 = .117; P = .009). Compared with the first trimester, the risk of poor sleep quality increased 2.11-fold in the second trimester (P= .048) and 1.86-fold in the third trimester (P= .054). Compared with the first trimester, EQ-5D scores significantly decreased in the second (P= .038) and third (P < .001) trimesters. Sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women were worse than those of nonpregnant healthy controls. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of deteriorations in sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women.

AB  - Background: Sleep is one of the most basic human requirements. This research aims at determining the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life among high-risk pregnant women in Tabriz, Iran, in 2015.Materials and Methods: This research was a sectional study done on 364 qualified women in 28-36 weeks of pregnancy suffering from mild preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The sampling was done as convenience. Personal-social-midwifery questionnaire, Pittsburg sleep quality, and quality of life in pregnancy (QOL-ORAV) were used for gathering data. Multivariate linear regression model was used for determining the relationship between sleep quality and its subsets with quality of life and controlling confounders.Findings: In the current study, the prevalence of sleep disturbance was 96.4%. Mean (SD) of the total score of sleep quality was 10.1 (4.1) and the total score of quality of life was 61.7 (17.3). According to Pearson's correlation test, there was statistically significant relationship between quality of life and sleep quality and all its subsets except sleep duration and use of sleep medication (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, according to the multivariate linear regression model, sleep latency, day time dysfunction, health status, and home air-conditioning were related with quality of life.Discussion: The findings of current research show that sleep quality is low among high-risk pregnant women and quality of life is medium. So, it is necessary that required training is given by health cares for improving sleep quality and quality of life to mothers.

This study aimed to determine the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life in Iranian pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 565 women recruited using 2-stage cluster sampling methods. Data were collected using sociodemographic characteristics; quality of life; and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire between March and May 2015. About 6% of the women had a sleep disorder. There were significant correlations between quality of life and total score of sleep quality, subdomains of habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction. Paying attention to the sleep quality as an effective factor of quality of life can promote sleep quality and hence quality of life of pregnant women.

AB  - PurposeBecause sleep is essential for normal pregnancy-associated physiological changes and healthy fetal development it is important to provide advice to first trimester expectant mothers in order to enhance self-care. Therefore, the aims of the present study are to clarify first trimester sleep quality and sleepiness characteristics, and to elucidate the affects of stress on sleep and sleepiness characteristics.MethodsSelf-administered questionnaires were distributed to 46 first trimester expectant mothers who were recruited from outpatient departments of two hospitals in Hiroshima, Japan between April 2007 and January 2008. The questionnaire was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a sleep log, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).ResultsThe average global score of the PSQI (PSQIG) was 6.67 (+/-3.20), and 65.2% of participants exceeded the cut-off score. Participants with higher perceived stress had significantly higher PSQIG scores (r=0.38, n=46, p<0.01). There was a positive correlation with PSQIG (r=0.40, n=46, p<0.01) and regularity of bedtime, indicating that participants with well-regulated daily habits have lower PSQIG scores. The average ESS score was 10.1 (+/-4.3), with 50.0% of participants scoring 11 points or higher. Moreover, primipara had higher scores than multipara (un-paired t (44)=2.52, p <0.05), and those participants with more children had lower scores (r=-0.32, n=46, p<0.05). Sleepiness duration and nap duration were not significantly different for parity. For employment (employed or not-employed), nap duration was significantly different (un-paired t (27)=2.27, p<0.05), however, there was no significant difference in sleepiness duration.ConclusionThis study has shown that first trimester expectant mothers have markedly poor sleep quality and higher levels of sleepiness when compared to women of the same age in the general population. In addition, this study suggests that sleep quality is improved by controlling stress and by having well regulated sleep habits.

T2  - Women & Birth
AB  - Background Pregnant women with complications including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) often experience disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These pathologies are aggravated by sympathetic nervous system activation and may be related to stress. The present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of and changes in sleep quality and stress in pregnant women with PIH and GDM during the second and third trimesters. Methods We enrolled 56 women in their second or third trimesters who were diagnosed with PIH or GDM. Participants completed questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Secretory immunoglobulin A (SlgA) concentrations were measured as a biological indicator of stress. Results PSS scores and subjective stress parameters were significantly higher than those reported from previous studies of healthy pregnant women (15.2 points and 15.1 points for the second and third trimesters, respectively). Mean one-day values for SIgA were 168.3 and 205.7 μg/mL for the second and third trimesters, respectively. During the second and third trimesters, SIgA scores were higher than those reported for healthy pregnant women in previous studies. The PSQI component scores sleep disturbance (C5) and sleep duration (C3) in follow up case were significantly higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester. Discussion This investigation suggests that pregnant women with PIH and GDM experience higher stress levels than do non-pregnant women and healthy pregnant women. Further, our results indicate that sleep quality worsens during the third trimester compared with the second trimester.

AB  - Women's sleep quality has been reported to change during pregnancy; prevalence estimates of poor sleep quality during pregnancy vary widely. To further understand the observed variation of findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Articles (N = 24) that reported prevalence of poor sleep quality as captured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) ≥ 5 were included, with a total of 11,002 participants contributing data. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched. Results indicated that the average PSQI score during pregnancy was 6.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.30, 6.85], and 45.7%, 95% CI [36.5%, 55.2%], of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality. Longitudinal studies indicated that sleep quality decreased from second (M = 5.31, SE = 0.40) to third trimester (M = 7.03, SE = 0.85) by 1.68 points, 95% CI [0.42, 2.94]. Gestational age moderated the average PSQI scores and prevalence of PSQI scores ≥5; older samples reported higher mean PSQI scores and higher prevalence of poor sleep quality. Clinicians should be aware that some reduction in sleep quality is expected during pregnancy, but complaints of very poor sleep quality could require intervention. Future research should examine various factors underlying poor sleep quality during pregnancy.

AB  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet underdiagnosed and under-investigated. We evaluated sleep quality during pregnancy and assessed associated factors, especially depressive and anxiety symptoms.Material and Methods: A total of 78 healthy pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were studied twice prospectively during pregnancy (in mid-pregnancy and late pregnancy). Sleep quality was evaluated by the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, depressive symptoms by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and anxiety symptoms by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.Results: Poor general sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings per night, and too-early morning awakenings increased in late pregnancy compared with mid-pregnancy (all p-values < 0.020). The total insomnia score (p < 0.001) and sleep latency increased (p = 0.005), but sleep duration and preferred sleep duration did not change. Women tended to snore more often in late pregnancy, but apneas remained rare. Almost one-fourth of the women reported both morning and daytime sleepiness, but the frequencies did not increase during the follow up. In late pregnancy, depressive and anxiety symptoms were cross-sectionally related to sleep disturbances, but depressive or anxiety symptoms in mid-pregnancy were not associated with sleep disturbances in late pregnancy.Conclusions: We found deterioration in sleep quality across pregnancy. However, no increase in negative daytime consequences was found, presumably indicating a compensatory capacity against sleep impairment. Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were only cross-sectionally associated. Our study calls for further research on the factors that influence sleep disturbances during pregnancy.

AB  - Hypothesis. Cancer patients frequently suffer from poor sleep quality. Bryophyllum pinnatum is a herbal medication used in anthroposophic medicine, which has been shown to be associated with improvements in sleep quality during pregnancy with only few and minor or moderate side-effects reported. In this study, the sleep quality of cancer patients during treatment with B pinnatum was investigated. Study Design. In this prospective, observational study, cancer patients suffering from sleep problems were treated with B pinnatum (350 mg tablets, corresponding to 50% of leaf pressed juice [Weleda AG, Arlesheim, Switzerland], dosage at physician’s consideration, but most frequently 2 tablets with evening meal and 2 before going to bed). Methods. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), daily sleepiness (Epworth Sleeping Scale [ESS]), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and after 3 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. From the 28 recruited patients, 20 completed both questionnaires and were considered in the present analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Results. Patients were 61 ± 10.4 years old and the majority were female (17 out of 20). During treatment with B pinnatum, the PSQI decreased from 12.2 ± 3.62 to 9.1 ± 3.61 (P < .01), and ESS changed from 8.4 ± 3.18 to 7.1 ± 3.98 (P < .05). There was no change in FSS. The treatment was well tolerated by the majority of patients, with only 6 patients reporting discomfort that might have been caused by B pinnatum (fatigue n = 3, dry throat n = 1, agitation n = 1, difficult digestion n = 1). No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. Conclusion. B pinnatum may be a suitable treatment for sleep problems of cancer patients. Controlled, randomized clinical trials of the use of B pinnatum in sleep disorders are urgently needed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Poor sleep quality in pregnancy is frequent. A treatment with sedatives is problematic due to possible adverse effects for mother and embryo/foetus. In the present study, we investigated the sedative effect of Bryophyllum pinnatum, a phytotherapeutic medication used in anthroposophic medicine. In previous clinical studies on its tocolytic effect, B. pinnatum showed a good risk/benefit ratio for mother and child. A recent analysis of the prescribing pattern for B. pinnatum in a network of anthroposophic physicians revealed sleep disorders as one of the most frequent diagnoses for which these preparations are prescribed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women suffering from sleep problems were treated with B. pinnatum (350mg tablets, 50% leaf press juice, Weleda AG, Arlesheim, dosage at physician's consideration). Sleep quality, daily sleepiness and fatigue were assessed with the aid of standardised questionnaires, at the beginning of the treatment and after 2 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. RESULTS: The number of wake-ups, as well as the subjective quality of sleep was significantly improved at the end of the treatment with B. pinnatum. The Epworth Sleeping Scale decreased, indicating a decrease of the tiredness during the day. There was, however, no evidence for prolongation of the sleep duration, reduction in the time to fall asleep, as well as change in the Fatigue Severity Scale after B. pinnatum. No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. CONCLUSION: B. pinnatum is a suitable treatment of sleep problems in pregnancy. The data of this study encourage further clinical investigations on the use of B. pinnatum in sleep disorders.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Because the maternal environment can affect several physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in young offspring. DESIGN: Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in 2 experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily. After birth, only male litters (6 for each mother) were selected and designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail plethysmography; at 3 months the renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, and number of glomeruli per mm3 were evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Offspring from SR had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group (OSR), we also observed significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter, and reduced number of glomeruli per mm3 of renal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.

AB  - Objectives Sleep problems and deprivation are common during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies are mostly descriptive or focused on specific clinical groups and late pregnancy. We aimed to identify sleep duration trajectories during the pregnancy period, their associated factors, and impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods We studied 200 women from a mother-child cohort recruited in 2009-2011 from the French general population. We used semi-parametric models to analyze data collected through questionnaires. Results We detected three sleep duration trajectories during pregnancy: short-decreasing (<6.5h/night, 10.8% of the sample), medium-decreasing (6.5-8h/night, 57.6%), and long-increasing (>8h/night, 31.6%) trajectories. Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13 [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working > 28 weeks of gestational age (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10-0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e. cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion We identified sleep trajectories among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal and child health.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to reveal the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety among Chinese pregnant women. Pregnant women were recruited in Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort at Zhoushan Maternal and Child Care Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Self-rating depression scales (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scales (SAS) were used for evaluating depression and anxiety status at each trimester; corresponding sleep quality and duration were reported by pregnant women. Ordinary or multilevel linear and logistic regression model were used to estimate the cross-sectional or longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety. The prevalence rates were 35.64, 24.23, and 26.24% for depression and 22.57, 17.41, and 21.04% for anxiety at 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd trimester (T3), respectively. Controlling for potential confounders, it revealed significant cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of sleep with depression and anxiety status. In cross-sectional analysis, women who slept less than 8 h/day had higher risk of depression (T1: OR (95%CI) = 1.75 (1.39, 2.20); T2: 1.52 (1.26, 2.05); T3: 1.60 (1.18, 2.05)) and anxiety (T1: 2.00 (1.57, 2.55); T2: 1.86 (1.37, 2.54); T3: 1.33 (0.99, 1.79)). In the longitudinal analysis, multilevel model revealed that women with subjective 'fair' or 'bad' sleep quality had elevated risk of depression (OR ranging from 1.54 to 3.71) and anxiety (2.38 to 7.53) during pregnancy. Prenatal depression and anxiety status were prevalent in pregnant women. Sleep quality was associated with depression and anxiety status in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, implying that improving sleep quality should benefit for mental health of pregnant women.

AB  - Background: Our Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study suggested that a brief sleep intervention in infancy reduced the risk of obesity at age 2 y. In contrast, we observed no benefit from the nutrition and activity intervention. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine how these interventions influenced growth at ages 3.5 and 5 y compared with usual care (Control). Design: A follow-up of a parallel, 4-arm, single-blind, 2-y, randomized controlled trial in 802 women (86% European, 48% primiparous) recruited in pregnancy (58% response rate) was undertaken. All groups received standardWell-Child care with additional support for 3 intervention groups: FAB (promotion of breastfeeding, healthy eating, physical activity: 8 contacts, antenatal, 18 mo); Sleep (prevention of sleep problems: antenatal, 3 wk); Combination (both interventions). Follow-up measures were collected by staff blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was child body mass index (BMI) z score, and secondary outcomes were prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile), self-regulation (psychological measures), sleep, physical activity (accelerometry, questionnaires), and dietary intake (food-frequency questionnaire). Analyses were conducted through the use of multiple imputation. Results: Retention was 77% at age 3.5 y and 69% at age 5 y. Children in the FAB group had significantly higher BMI z scores than did Controls at age 5 y (adjusted difference: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.47) but not at age 3.5 y (0.15; 95% CI: -0.04, 0.34). Children who received the Sleep intervention (Sleep and Combination groups) had significantly lower BMI z scores at age 3.5 y (-0.24; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.10) and at age 5 y (-0.23; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.07) than children who did not (Control and FAB groups). Conclusions: A conventional intervention had unexpected adverse long-term weight outcomes, whereas positive outcomes from a less conventional sleep intervention remained promising at age 5 y. More intensive or extended sleep intervention might have larger or longerlasting effects and should be investigated. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00892983.

Design: A follow-up of a parallel, 4-arm, single-blind, 2-y, randomized controlled trial in 802 women (86% European, 48% primiparous) recruited in pregnancy (58% response rate) was undertaken. All groups received standard Well-Child care with additional support for 3 intervention groups: FAB (promotion of breastfeeding, healthy eating, physical activity: 8 contacts, antenatal, 18 mo); Sleep (prevention of sleep problems: antenatal, 3 wk); Combination (both interventions). Follow-up measures were collected by staff blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was child body mass index (BMI) z score, and secondary outcomes were prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile), self-regulation (psychological measures), sleep, physical activity (accelerometry, questionnaires), and dietary intake (food-frequency questionnaire). Analyses were conducted through the use of multiple imputation. Results: Retention was 77% at age 3.5 y and 69% at age 5 y. Children in the FAB group had significantly higher BMI z scores than did Controls at age 5 y (adjusted difference: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.47) but not at age 3.5 y (0.15; 95% CI: −0.04, 0.34). Children who received the Sleep intervention (Sleep and Combination groups) had significantly lower BMI z scores at age 3.5 y (−0.24; 95% CI: −0.38, −0.10) and at age 5 y (−0.23; 95% CI: −0.38, −0.07) than children who did not (Control and FAB groups). Conclusions: A conventional intervention had unexpected adverse long-term weight outcomes, whereas positive outcomes from a less conventional sleep intervention remained promising at age 5 y. More intensive or extended sleep intervention might have larger or longer-lasting effects and should be investigated. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00892983.

AB  - Sleep and sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as determinants of women's health and well-being, particularly in the context of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. At present, however, little is known about whether fertility is affected by sleep quantity and quality. That is, to what degree, and by what mechanisms, do sleep and/or its disturbances affect fertility? The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about sleep disturbances in relation to reproductive capacity. A model is provided, whereby stress, sleep dysregulation, and circadian misalignment are delineated for their potential relevance to infertility. Ultimately, if it is the case that sleep disturbance is associated with infertility, new avenues for clinical intervention may be possible.

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing occurs in 0.6–15% of reproductive age women. This condition is associated with an increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. A substantial body of evidence demonstrated increased perinatal morbidity among pregnancies affected by SDB including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia. These same conditions are predictive of later cardiovascular disease. Treatment of SDB has been demonstrated to decrease future cardiovascular events and mortality. Screening at-risk individuals in the perinatal period can identify women with SDB, who can benefit from treatment. Continuous positive airway pressure and lifestyle interventions can decrease subsequent adverse cardiovascular health outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Recently, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been reported to be associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Accordingly, as this is emergent area of research that has significant clinical relevance, the objective of this meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between SDB with GDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We searched several electronic databases for all of the studies published before January 2013 and reviewed references of published articles. Meta-analytic procedures were used to estimate the unadjusted and BMI-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a random effects model. Significant values, weighted effect sizes, and 95% CIs were calculated, and tests of homogeneity of variance were performed. RESULTS Results from nine independent studies with a total of 9,795 pregnant women showed that SDB was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Women with SDB had a more than threefold increased risk of GDM, with a pooled BMI-adjusted OR 3.06 (95% CI 1.89-4.96). CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate a significant association between SDB and GDM that is evident even after considered confounding by obesity. This meta-analysis indicates a need to evaluate the role of early recognition and treatment of SDB early during pregnancy.

T2  - Seminars in Perinatology
AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a group of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or abnormal gas exchange during sleep. The most common type of SDB, especially among young obese women, is obstructive sleep apnea. SDB has clearly been linked to poor sleep and impaired daytime function, but there are also data linking SDB to other health outcomes, principally cardiovascular and metabolic disease. SDB symptoms are common in pregnancy, and pregnancy itself has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of SDB symptoms. Although a link between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to be biologically plausible, data exploring this relationship are only now emerging, and large prospective studies in which the authors use objective measures of sleep are lacking. Until we know more about the epidemiology and the impact of SDB in pregnancy, screening efforts for SDB in pregnancy should be focused on identifying very symptomatic patients because treatment of these individuals often leads to improved sleep quality and daytime functioning.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: This article reviews current data on pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy may cause harm, and explores biological pathways for associated adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, especially pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes.Recent Findings: Accumulating data indicate that snoring and sleep apnea during pregnancy are likely to increase the risk for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Several new studies have observed that sleep-disordered breathing and short sleep duration also increase the risk of gestational diabetes, similar to observations in the general population. There are varying levels of emerging evidence for potential mechanisms, including oxidative stress, increased sympathetic activity and inflammation, adipokine levels and insulin resistance, linking sleep-disordered breathing events during pregnancy to adverse outcomes.Summary: Sleep-disordered breathing and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes share a number of mechanistic pathways, and growing data in pregnant women indicate that snoring and sleep apnea increase the risk of these and other complications for both the mother and the fetus. Nevertheless, direct evidence of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy exerts negative effects remains sparse.

AB  - Pregnancy is associated with many physiologic and hormonal changes along with changes in sleep architecture, placing pregnant women at risk for the development of sleep-disordered breathing or worsening of preexisting sleep apnea. Snoring, the most common symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is markedly increased during pregnancy. The exact prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women is unknown. Because the apneic episodes are commonly associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturations, the combination of obstructive sleep apnea and pregnancy can be potentially harmful to the fetus given the low oxygen reserves during pregnancy. Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension among the general population, and this raises the possibility of its association with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In this clinical review, we discuss the physiologic changes of pregnancy that predispose pregnant women to the development of obstructive sleep apnea and the effects of sleep-disordered breathing on pregnancy outcomes. We also review the recommendations regarding evaluation for sleep apnea and treatment options during pregnancy and postpartum.

T2  - Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey
AB  - Importance: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common condition in postreproductive females. Key risk factors for later-life CVD include gestational hypertension (GHTN) and preeclampsia (PE). Although several risk factors of hypertension in pregnancy are well recognized, a novel risk factor that has emerged recently is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a condition characterized by repeated closure of the upper airway during sleep with disrupted ventilation and sleep fragmentation. In the nonpregnant population, SDB is now known to play a causal role in future CVD.Objective: The aim of this study was to propose the hypothesis that occult SDB during pregnancy may play a role in long-term CVD in women who had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Evidence Acquisition: This study is a review and synthesis of empirical evidence that links SDB to GHTN/PE and GHTN/PE to future CVD.Results: An increasing body of evidence supports the relationship between SDB and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy via mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. It is well established that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with long-term risk for CVD via similar mechanisms. However, no studies have addressed the potential role of SDB in long-term outcomes of women with GHTN/PE during pregnancy.Conclusions: Given the suggested mechanisms that explain these associations, it is plausible that SDB during pregnancy may increase long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Relevance: Pregnancy may offer a window of opportunity for identification and treatment of SDB, which could provide substantial health benefit for many years to come.

AB  - Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing are more common in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women. It is likely that physiology of pregnancy predisposes to the development or worsening of sleep-disordered breathing, but some physiologic changes may also be protective against the development of this disease. Clinical presentation may be less predictive of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy than in the non-pregnant population; nonetheless, snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Treatment strategies are similar to the nonpregnant population, however, pregnancy-specific scenarios may arise and these subtleties are addressed in this review.

AB  - In nonpregnant populations, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Few studies have examined the relationship between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). The objective of this study was to examine the association between SDB and APO. Women who had a delivery as well as an in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG) were identified. Demographics, PSG results, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. Absence of SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of <5, mild SDB as an AHI of 5 to 14.9, and moderate to severe SDB as an AHI of â¥15. The primary outcome was a composite measure of APO: pregnancy-related hypertension, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth â¤34 weeks. We identified 143 women who had undergone a PSG and a delivery. Increasing severity of SDB was associated with an increasing risk of the composite APO: AHI <5, 18.1%; AHI 5 to 14.9, 23.5%; AHI â¥15, 38.5% (p = 0.038). Obese women (body mass index â¥30) with moderate to severe SDB had the highest rate of APO, 41.7%. SDB, especially moderate to severe disease, may be associated with APO. However, it is unclear if SDB is a risk factor for APO independent of obesity.

AB  - The aims of this study were to examine: (1) the association between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and sleep quality in a population-based cohort of Australian women and (2) possible influence of reproductive status and mental and physical health factors on these associations. Data on 3,655 women (mean age = 46.6 years, range 34.3-67.4) were obtained from the Mater Hospital University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy for this cross-sectional study. Self-rated sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For the purpose of this study, two cutoff points (scores 5 and 10) were used to divide women into three categories: normal (65.2 %), moderately poor (26.4 %), and very poor sleep quality (8.5 %). Other covariates were measured at 21-year follow-up as well. After adjusting for reproductive status, mental and physical health, there were significant associations between moderately poor sleep quality and education and between very poor sleep quality and unemployment, both measures of socioeconomic status. In addition, work-related exertion was associated with increased rates of moderately poor sleep quality, whereas those women undertaking moderate exercise were less likely to experience very poor sleep quality. Independent associations between sociodemographic factors and exercise with moderately poor and very poor sleep quality were identified. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between exercise/exertion, socioeconomic status, and sleep quality and highlight the importance of taking these into consideration when dealing with issues of poor sleep quality in women.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate sleep-related disordered breathing in obese women during pregnancy. Obesity is known to predispose to sleep-related breathing disorders. During pregnancy, obese mothers gain additional weight, but other mechanisms may counteract this effect. DESIGN: A case-control study to compare sleep-related breathing in obese pregnant women (mean prepregnancy body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m(2)) with pregnant women of normal weight (mean BMI, 20 to 25 kg/m(2)). SETTING: University teaching hospital with a sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 11 obese women (BMI, 34 kg/m(2); mean age 31 years) and 11 control women (BMI, 23 kg/m(2); mean age 32 years). INTERVENTIONS: Overnight polysomnography was performed during early (after 12 weeks) and late (after 30 weeks) pregnancy. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During pregnancy, obese mothers gained 13 kg and control women gained 16 kg. Sleep characteristics did not differ between the groups. During late pregnancy, the women in both groups slept more poorly and slept in supine position less. During early pregnancy, their apnea-hypopnea indexes (1.7 events per hour vs 0.2 events per hour; p < 0.05), 4% oxygen desaturations (5.3 events per hour vs 0.3 events per hour; p < 0.005), and snoring times (32% vs 1%, p < 0.001) differed significantly. These differences between the groups persisted in the second polysomnography, with snoring time further increasing in the obese. Preeclampsia and mild obstructive sleep apnea were diagnosed in one obese mother. One obese mother delivered a baby showing growth retardation (weight - 3 SD). CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significantly more sleep-related disordered breathing occurring in obese mothers than in subjects of normal weight, despite similar sleeping characteristics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine how sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms of Japanese parents are related to their sleeping arrangements before and after the birth of their first child. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal, time-series methods. SETTING: Participants' homes in four geographical areas of Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 101 Japanese first-time parent couples who completed antepartum and postpartum questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm from 7-day logs at 32 to 36 weeks gestation and 4 to 5 weeks postpartum and daily social rhythm from Monk's Social Rhythm Metric. RESULTS: Mothers' total sleep time and activity level decreased after birth. Social rhythms became less regular for mothers and more consistent and regular for fathers. Although sleeping arrangement had no effect on parents' daily social rhythms, it had a significant effect on the 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm. Regularity of sleep-wake rhythms was more prominent for fathers sleeping with mother and baby than for fathers sleeping alone. CONCLUSIONS: Couples having their first child face great changes in their sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms. Nurses can counsel expectant parents to think about their sleeping habits and social activities and assist them in making informed decisions about the best sleeping arrangement during transition to parenthood.

AB  - Background: Smoking tobacco increases the risk of respiratory disease in adults and children, but communicating the magnitude of these effects in a scientific manner that is accessible and usable by the public and policymakers presents a challenge. We have therefore summarized scientific data on the impact of smoking on respiratory diseases to provide the content for a unique resource, SmokeHaz.Methods: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies (published to 2013) identified from electronic databases, gray literature, and experts. Random effect meta-analyses were used to pool the findings.Results: We included 216 articles. Among adult smokers, we confirmed substantially increased risks of lung cancer (risk ratio (RR), 10.92; 95% CI, 8.28-14.40; 34 studies), COPD (RR, 4.01; 95% CI, 3.18-5.05; 22 studies), and asthma (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.42; eight studies). Exposure to passive smoke significantly increased the risk of lung cancer in adult nonsmokers and increased the risks of asthma, wheeze, lower respiratory infections, and reduced lung function in children. Smoking significantly increased the risk of sleep apnea and asthma exacerbations in adult and pregnant populations, and active and passive smoking increased the risk of tuberculosis.Conclusions: These findings have been translated into easily digestible content and published on the SmokeHaz website.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: To examine the association between snoring, sleep quality, quantity, and blood pressure in third‐trimester normotensive pregnant women. Design: This study was a cross‐sectional analysis of two cohorts of healthy pregnant women recruited from a prenatal clinic in a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Methods: A total of 322 women reported sociodemographic and health characteristics in a structured interview and wore a wrist actigraph on their nondominant wrist for 7 consecutive days to assess objective sleep patterns. The women's resting blood pressures were measured while seated in the clinic by trained personnel using an electronic sphygmomanometer. Findings: One hundred thirty‐three (41.3%) women reported snoring. Ninety‐three women (28.9%) had <6 hr of nighttime sleep, with only 95 (29.5%) women averaging 7 or more hours of nighttime sleep. In the univariate analyses, snoring was positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as mean arterial pressure levels (p < .05). In the multivariate analyses, snoring remained as a significant predictor of higher diastolic blood pressure (β = 2.07, p < .05) and mean arterial pressure levels (β = 2.00, p < .05), after adjustment for age, parity, gestational age, body mass index before pregnancy, and sleep quantity and quality by actigraphy. Conclusions: Snoring is a highly prevalent condition experienced by healthy third‐trimester pregnant women and is associated with elevated blood pressure. Clinical Relevance: Clinical assessment and screening of snoring are of utmost importance in obstetric nursing practice to potentially prevent or reduce the associated adverse cardiovascular consequences in women during pregnancy.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: This cohort study examined the impact of maternal snoring on key delivery outcomes such as mode of delivery, infant birth centile, and small-for-gestational age. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: A large tertiary medical center. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-forgestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: IDENTIFIER: NCT01030003.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the relationship between snoring and pregnancy-induced hypertension and growth retardation of the fetus. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional, consecutive case series. SETTING: The Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Umea, Sweden. Participants and measurements: On the day of delivery, 502 women with singleton pregnancies completed a questionnaire about snoring, witnessed sleep apneas, and daytime fatigue. Data concerning medical complications were taken from the women's casebooks. RESULTS: During the last week of pregnancy, 23% of the women reported snoring every night. Only 4% reported snoring before becoming pregnant. Hypertension developed in 14% of snoring women, compared with 6% of nonsnorers (p < 0.01). Preeclampsia occurred in 10% of snorers, compared with 4% of nonsnorers (p < 0.05). An Apgar score < or = 7 was more common in infants born to habitual snorers. Growth retardation of the fetus, defined as small for gestational age at birth, had occurred in 7.1% of the infants of snoring mothers and 2.6% of the remaining infants (p < 0.05). Habitual snoring was independently predictive of hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.03; p < 0.05) and growth retardation (OR, 3.45; p < 0.01) in a logistic regression analysis controlling for weight, age, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a sign of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Snoring indicates a risk of growth retardation of the fetus.

AB  - Postpartum weight retention plays an important role in the pathway leading to obesity among women of childbearing age. The objective of this study was to examine predictors of moderate (1-10 pounds) and high (>10 pounds) postpartum weight retention using data from a prospective pregnancy cohort that followed women into the postpartum period; n = 688 and 550 women at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Analysis included descriptive statistics and predictive modeling using log-binomial techniques. The average weight retained at 3 and 12 months postpartum in this population was 9.4 lb (s.d. = 11.4) and 5.7 lb (s.d. = 13.2), respectively. At 3 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and hours slept during the night were associated with moderate or high weight retention, whereas having an infant hospitalized after going home and scoring in the upper 75th percentile of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) were associated only with high weight retention. At 12 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and maternal education were associated with moderate weight retention; and gestational weight gain, maternal age, race, employment status, and having an infant hospitalized at birth were associated with high weight retention. The results of this study illustrate the importance of prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain in predicting postpartum weight retention. Furthermore, given the lack of successful intervention studies that exist to date to help women lose weight in the postpartum period, the results of this study may help to inform future interventions that focus on such aspects as hours of sleep, dealing with stress associated with a hospitalized infant, and nonclinical eating disorder symptomatology.

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal variables and postpartum depression, anxiety and stress levels in new mothers.Method: One-hundred-thirty-nine women completed the baseline questionnaire and 105 completed the follow-up questionnaire at 4-6 months postpartum. Sociodemographic and pregnancy factors were assessed at baseline, birth and postnatal factors were assessed at time 2, and depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at both time points.Results: Caesarean delivery was associated with high postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Child sleep problems was related to depression, child health problems were related to anxiety, more SLE related to high stress, and maternal sleep problems were related to PPD. However, the results became non-significant after controlling for antenatal distress levels. Finally, women who underwent caesarean delivery had higher antenatal stress, anxiety, and depression levels, relative to women who did not undergo the procedure.Conclusion: Psychological stress and distress tended to persist in the women from the third-trimester of pregnancy to 4-6 months postpartum. It tended to occur in the context of caesarean delivery, maternal sleep problems, child's health and sleep problems, and stressful life-events.

AU  - Graven SN
T2  - Journal of Perinatology
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the conclusions and associated recommendations for care developed by the Physical and Developmental Environment of the High-Risk Infant Center, Study Group on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Sound, and the Expert Review Panel. STUDY DESIGN: A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers reviewed the literature regarding the effect of sound on the fetus, newborn, and preterm infant and developed recommendations based on the best evidence. An Expert Review Panel reviewed the data and conclusions. RESULTS: The following recommendations are developed from the review of the literature and are clarified in the body of the article. (1) Women should avoid prolonged exposure to low-frequency sound levels (< 250 Hz) above 65 dB(A) during pregnancy. (2) Earphones or other devices for sound production should not be used directly attached to the pregnant woman's abdomen. (3) The voice of the mother during normal daily activities, along with the sounds produced by her body and those present in her usual surroundings, is sufficient for normal fetal auditory development. The fetus does not require supplemental stimulation. Programs to supplement the fetal auditory experience cannot be recommended. (4) Infant intensive care units should incorporate a system of regular noise assessment. (5) Sound limit recommendations are to maintain a nursery with an hourly Leq of 50 dB(A), an hourly L10 of 55 dB(A) and a 1-second Lmax of 70 dB(A), all A-weighted, slow response scale. (6) Infant intensive care units should develop and maintain a program of noise control and abatement in order to operate within the recommended permissible noise criteria. (7) Care practices must provide ample opportunity for the infant to hear parent voices live in interaction between parent and infant at the bedside. (8) Earphones and other devices attached to the infant's ears for sound transmission should not be used at any time. (9) There is little evidence to support the use of recorded music or speech in the environment of the high-risk infant. Audio recordings should not be used routinely or left unattended in the environment of the high-risk infant. CONCLUSION: The recommendations, if followed, should provide an environment that will protect sleep, support stable vital signs, improve speech intelligibility for the infant, and reduce potential adverse effects on auditory development.

AB  - Rationale: Better phenotypic descriptions are needed for chronic lung disease among surviving premature infants.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of respiratory inductance plethysmography in characterizing respiratory system mechanics in preterm infants at 32 weeks postmenstrual age.Methods: Respiratory inductance plethysmography was used to obtain the phase angle, Φ, to describe rib cage and abdominal dyssynchrony in 65 infants born between 23 and 28 weeks gestation, all of whom were studied at 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Up to 60 breaths were evaluated for each subject. Sources of intrasubject variability in Φ arising from our methods were explored using mechanical models and by evaluating interobserver agreement.Measurements and Main Results: The mean Φ from infants ranged from 5.8-162.9°, with intrasubject coefficients of variation ranging from 11-123%. On the basis of the mechanical model studies, respiratory inductance plethysmography recording and analysis software added <2.3% to the intrasubject variability in Φ. Potential inconsistencies in breaths selected could have contributed 8.1%, on average, to the total variability. The recording sessions captured 22.8 ± 9.1 minutes of quiet sleep, and enough breaths were counted to adequately characterize the range of Φ in the session.Conclusion: Φ is quite variable during even short recording sessions among preterm infants sleeping quietly. The intrasubject variability described herein arises from the instability of the rib cage and abdominal phase relationship, not from the recording and analytical methods used. Despite the variability, Φ measurements allowed the majority (80%) of infants to be reliably categorized as having relatively synchronous or dyssynchronous breathing.

TI  - Sources of midsleep awakenings in childbearing women.
AU  - Baratte-Beebe KR

T2  - Clinical Nursing Research
AB  - Sleep disturbance is a complaint of childbearing women that has implications for perinatal health. A descriptive, longitudinal study examined the numbers and sources of midsleep awakenings in women prior to conception and during each trimester of pregnancy. A secondary analysis of data from a larger study of sleep during childbearing was performed for subjects (n = 25) who completed sleep diaries across the four measurement periods. There was a two-fold increase in the number of awakenings from pre-conception to the third trimester of pregnancy. Maintenance insomnia during pregnancy follows a pattern of prevalence that can be characterized by trimester. The predominant source of awakening during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy was due to the need to urinate. Parity and environmental circumstances can influence sources of awakenings. Nurses working with childbearing women can provide information and assistance with strategies to minimize or mitigate lengthy episodes of sleep disturbance.

AB  - Aim: To transcultural adapt and analyze the reliability of Spanish version of Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI) and assess the prevalence of pregnancy symptoms in Spanish pregnant women.Materials and Methods: A subsample of 120 healthy pregnant women answered the PSI twice and a sample of 280 report the prevalence and limitation of pregnancy symptoms. The reliability was examined by means of percent agreement and weighted Kappa coefficients. The prevalence of pregnancy symptoms was evaluated by the frequency of answers.Results: Perfect and perfect-acceptable agreement was observed in 82% and 96% of the pregnant women, respectively. Weighted Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.589 to 0.889, indicating a good reliability. The most frequent symptoms perceived by Spanish pregnant women were urinary frequency, poor sleep, increased vaginal discharge and tiredness.Conclusion: Spanish Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory is a brief, conceptually equivalent and satisfactory reliable tool that allows an early assessment of the wide range of pregnancy symptoms in the health care practices.

T2  - SCI Nursing
AB  - This article describes some of the experiences encountered by two women with spinal cord injuries (SCI) during pregnancy. Pregnant women, with or without a SCI, encounter some common experiences. Common complaints of pregnancy for both include urinary tract infections, sleep problems, and constipation. Complaints specific to those women with a SCI centered around issues such as increased urinary incontinence, autonomic dysreflexia and delayed wound healing. The women with SCI neither developed pressure areas nor experienced premature deliveries, major complications predicted by literature. Women with SCI have felt that they were victims of inadequate environmental designs that hindered their mobility and inhibited their independence. Many of the psychosocial aspects studied proved to be common to pregnant women in general and not specific to individuals with spinal cord injury.

TI  - Stability of the infant car seat challenge and risk factors for oxygen desaturation events.
AU  - DeGrazia M
AB  - Research suggests that infants with poor neck and upper torso muscle tone experience lateral slouching and a compromised airway when placed in the semi-upright seating position. Studies reveal that 4-60% of premature infants (born at less than 37 weeks gestation) may experience oxygen desaturation events when in their child safety seats (CSS), potentially resulting in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that premature infants be tested in their CSS prior to hospital discharge. However, neonatal healthcare providers are concerned that this method of testing might not be reliable. No formal studies have investigated the outcomes of repeat testing of premature infants, and little is known about the risk factors for oxygen desaturation events. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive, non-experimental, observational study was to explore the stability of the one-point Infant Car Seat Challenge (ICSC) and risk factors that may be associated with oxygen desaturation events. A sample of 49 premature infants was used to explore the following variables: (1) pass/fail rates following two (ICSC) observation points, (2) oxygen saturation and desaturation patterns, sleep/wake activity, and a measure of head lag (using the pull-to-sit maneuver) during two ICSCs, and (3) the association between head lag, chronological age, time spent sleeping in the CSS and oxygen desaturation events. Data were analyzed by descriptive and nonparametric statistical tests. This study's findings indicated that 86% of premature infants had stable results, 8% passed ICSC 1 but not ICSC 2, and 6% failed ICSC 1 and passed ICSC 2. In addition the odds for oxygen desaturation events increased in infants that are born at a gestational age <=34 weeks, were discharged home at a chronological age of >7 days and had a corrected gestational age of >=37 weeks. Neither head lag or sleep time influenced the ICSC outcomes. Furthermore the ICSC success rate for identifying at risk infants was equal to or better than that of other screening tests for newborn medical conditions. These findings will assist neonatal healthcare providers in making appropriate recommendations for safe travel.

TI  - Strategies used by Jordanian women to alleviate heartburn during pregnancy.
AU  - Khresheh, Reham
T2  - Midwifery
AB  - Abstract: Objective: to explore the strategies used by Jordanian women to manage heartburn during pregnancy. Design: an exploratory descriptive study. Participants and setting: 235 Jordanian women from the three regions of Jordan, aged between 18 and 54 years, who were pregnant at the time of the study or had previously had at least one full-term pregnancy. Findings: a number of strategies were used by Jordanian women in the sample for the alleviation of heartburn of pregnancy, including non-pharmacological strategies such as diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatments such as antacids, and the use of home remedies such as drinking cold milk, ‘baking powder’ in liquid form or herbs, eating cucumber, lintel seeds, or dry tea leaves. Women aged 40 years and older, who had lower income, and were not employed were more likely to use home remedies to manage heartburn in pregnancy than the other groups. Overall, women rated their chosen strategy as useful. Key conclusions and implications for practice: heartburn can be very uncomfortable and can affect food intake and appetite, daily routine and even sleep. Heartburn during pregnancy is at risk for being poorly managed given that birth is the cure. As a health-care provider, it is important to prepare women and their families to manage heartburn during pregnancy effectively. Midwives should encourage women to seek help from care providers when they need it, and continue to assess heartburn and the strategies used to manage symptoms during pregnancy.

AB  - Objectives: The role of stress in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has so far been neglected. We investigated the impact of stress exposure (pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events), psychological stress responses (perceived stress, subjective experience of stress, anxiety, depression, sleep), and physiological stress responses (salivary cortisol, plasma copeptin levels) on glucose concentrations during pregnancy.Design: Cross-sectional study, including 203 pregnant women at the maternity department of a Swiss university hospital.Methods: All women underwent routine screening for GDM with a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test at 24-30 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events, perceived stress, general psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and amount of sleep were assessed by validated self-report questionnaires. Cortisol was measured using fasting and bedtime saliva samples, and copeptin using fasting plasma. All data were collected before communication of the screening test results.Results: Significant positive associations were found between the number of pregnancy-related major life events and fasting glucose, while there was no association with pregnancy-unrelated major life events. More anxiety and depressive symptoms, a higher general level of distress, and a shorter duration of sleep were related to fasting glucose, although the latter two were no longer significant when age and BMI were controlled for. However, physiological stress responses were not associated with glucose concentrations. When testing for unique associations with fasting glucose, more general distress and shorter duration of sleep independently accounted for higher fasting glucose levels. Finally, when comparing women with and without GDM, we found that women who subsequently received the diagnosis of GDM reported more pregnancy-related life events.Conclusions: Some indicators of stress exposure and psychological stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant women, thus representing important risk factors for GDM development. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Only approximately half of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) report any known risk factors. Women after GDM diagnosis reported more major life events compared to healthy pregnant controls. What does this study add? Stress exposure and psychological stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant before women were aware of their GDM diagnosis. These represent important risk factors for GDM development and potential targets for intervention.

AB  - Pregnancy for a majority of women lends itself to excitement and anticipation; it may likewise bring on stress, anxiety, depression, and feelings of ambiguity. Managing stress appropriately in pregnancy through relaxation therapy, music therapy, or methods for attaining adequate sleep contributes to a healthier and more comfortable pregnancy for the mother and enhances fetal growth and development. The purpose of this paper is to focus on stress management interventions in pregnancy, which ultimately leads to a healthier pregnancy for the mother and the unborn baby.

AB  - This study examines the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, sleep quality and unplanned caesarean delivery. For this research, we adopted a prospective survey design and a sample of 200 women in the early stages of labour. The findings were as follows: (i) 11.5% of the participants underwent unplanned caesarean sections; (ii) based on a Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index split point of 5, approximately 90.5% of the participants experienced poor sleep quality; and (iii) the odds ratio for primiparas undergoing an unplanned caesarean section was 4.183 times that for multiparas (95% cocfidence interval (CI) = 1.177 to 14.864), indicating a statistically significant difference. The results also showed that stress was a significant factor related to unplanned caesarean sections; a 1-point increase on the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale was associated with a 1.033-fold higher probability of undergoing an unplanned caesarean section (95% CI = 1.002 to 1.065). Furthermore, prenatal stress was a significant variable that can be used to predict unplanned caesarean deliveries.

AB  - This study investigated the mediating roles of sleep and depression on the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake among low-income overweight and obese pregnant women by trimesters. Participants (N = 213) completed a self-administered survey including stress (exogenous variable), depression, sleep (mediators), fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake (endogenous variables). Path analysis was performed to compare mediation effects among pregnant women in each trimester. Consistently across three trimesters, stress was related to depression but not sleep duration, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency or fat intake. Sleep duration was not associated with depression. Depending on trimester, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, and sleep latency were related to depression; night time sleep disturbance and depression affected fat intake; stress influenced fruit and vegetable intake. Sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency and depression did not mediate the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake in the second and third trimesters. However, depression mediated the relationship between stress and fat intake in the first trimester. Stress management interventions may help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women decrease depressive symptoms and therefore contribute to overall nutritional health.

AB  - While prolactin is most well known for its role in lactation and suppression of reproduction, its physiological functions are quite diverse. There are many etiologies of hyperprolactinemia, including physiologic as well as pathologic causes. Physiologic causes include pregnancy, lactation, sleep-associated, nipple stimulation and sexual orgasm, chest wall stimulation, or trauma. Stress is also an important physiologic cause of hyperprolactinemia, and its clinical significance is still being explored. This review will provide an overview of prolactin physiology, the role of stress in prolactin secretion, as well as the general clinical approach to hyperprolactinemia.

AB  - Background: Stress, depression, and anxiety affect 15 to 25% of pregnant women. However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care providers assess and treat mental health problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek mental healthcare. For those who seek treatment, the lack of health system integration and existing barriers frequently prevent treatment access. Without treatment, poor prenatal mental health can persist for years and impact future maternal, child, and family well-being.Methods/design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated process of online psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pregnant women compared to usual prenatal care (no formal screening or specialized care). The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. Pregnant women are eligible if they: 1) are <28 weeks gestation; 2) speak/read English; 3) are willing to complete email questionnaires; 4) have no, low, or moderate psychosocial risk on screening at recruitment; and 5) are eligible for CBT. A sample of 816 women will be recruited from large, urban primary care clinics and allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment, and those with mild or moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms then complete six interactive cognitive behavior therapy modules. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Clinic-based providers and researchers conducting chart abstraction and analysis are blinded. Qualitative interviews with 8 to 10 healthcare providers and 15 to 30 intervention group women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results of this trial will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated approach to prenatal mental healthcare and the use of highly accessible computer-based psychosocial assessment and CBT on maternal, infant, and family-based outcomes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01901796.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Preterm infants are at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with term born infants and the risk is inversely proportional to the gestational age and birthweight. Parents of these infants should have adequate knowledge and practise the recommended SIDS risk reduction measures. Methods: A survey was conducted between December 2016 and August 2017 at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. Parents of preterm infants ≤36 weeks’ gestation were invited to answer a self‐administered questionnaire to assess their knowledge and practise regarding SIDS risk reduction. Results: Forty‐nine (61.33%) of the 80 parents had heard of SIDS prior to the interview, with social media being the commonest source of information (67.3%). Only 35 (43.7%) correctly answered at least five of nine questions on knowledge of SIDS risk reduction (“good knowledge”). When compared with the group of parents who answered less than five questions correctly (“poor knowledge”), there was no significant difference in the demographic and infant characteristics between the groups. The majority (68.8%) of parents practised bed sharing with their infants, and this was significantly more common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.01). Household smoking was also significantly more common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.048). Conclusion: Knowledge on SIDS risk reduction measures was generally poor among parents of preterm infants in this study. Cigarette smoking, bed sharing and non‐supine sleep positions, which are associated with increased risk of SIDS, were common practise among the present subjects.

AB  - Problem/Condition: Disparities in maternal and infant health have been observed among members of different racial and ethnic populations and persons of differing socioeconomic status. For the Healthy People 2010 objectives for maternal and child health to be achieved (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy People 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington DC: US Department of Health and Human Services, 2000), the nature and extent of disparities in maternal behaviors that affect maternal or infant health should be understood. Identifying these disparities can assist public health authorities in developing policies and programs targeting persons at greatest risk for adverse health outcomes.Reporting Period Covered: 2000--2001.Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of different perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants in 31 states and New York City. This report summarizes data for 2000--2001 from eight states (Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, and North Carolina) on four behaviors (smoking during pregnancy, alcohol use during pregnancy, breastfeeding initiation, and use of the infant back sleep position) for which substantial health disparities have been identified previously.Results: Although the prevalence of each behavior varied by state, consistent patterns were observed among the eight states by age, race, ethnicity, education, and income level. Overall, the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy ranged from 9.0% to 17.4%. Younger (aged <25 years) women, white women, American Indian women, non-Hispanic women (except in Hawaii), women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes consistently reported the highest rates of smoking. Overall, the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy ranged from 3.4% to 9.9%. In seven states, women aged >/=35 years, non-Hispanic women, women with more than a high school education, and women with higher incomes reported the highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy. Overall, the prevalence of breastfeeding initiation ranged from 54.8% to 89.6%. Younger women, black women, women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes reported the lowest rates of breastfeeding initiation. The size of the black-white disparity in breastfeeding varied among states. Overall, use of the back sleep position for infants ranged from 49.7% to 74.8%. Use of the back sleep position was lowest among younger women, black women, women with lower levels of education, and women with low incomes. Ethnic differences in sleep position varied substantially by state.Interpretation: PRAMS data can be used to identify racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in critical maternal health-related behaviors. Although similar general patterns by age, education, and income were observed in at least seven states, certain racial and ethnic disparities varied by state. Prevalence of the four behaviors among each population often varied by state, indicating the potential impact of state-specific policies and programs.Public Health Action: States can use PRAMS data to identify populations at greatest risk for maternal behaviors that have negative consequences for maternal and infant health and to develop policies and plan programs that target populations at high risk. Although prevalence data cannot be used to identify causes or interventions to improve health outcomes, they do indicate the magnitude of disparities and identify populations that should be targeted for intervention. This report indicates a need for wider targeting than is often done. The results from this report can aid state and national agencies in creating more effective public health policies and programs. The data described in this report should serve as a baseline that states can use to measure the impact of policies and programs on eliminating these health disparities.

AB  - Background: The Auckland Stillbirth study demonstrated a two-fold increased risk of late stillbirth for women who did not go to sleep on their left side. Two further studies have confirmed an increased risk of late stillbirth with supine sleep position. As sleep position is modifiable, we surveyed self-reported late pregnancy sleep position, knowledge about sleep position, and views about changing going-to-sleep position.Methods: Participants in this 2014 survey were pregnant women (n = 377) in their third trimester from South Auckland, New Zealand, a multi-ethnic and predominantly low socio-economic population. An ethnically-representative sample was obtained using random sampling. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with non-left sided going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy.Results: Respondents were 28 to 42 weeks' gestation. Reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left side (30%), right side (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%) and other (6%). Two thirds (68%) reported they had received advice about sleep position. Non-left sleepers were asked if they would be able to change to their left side if it was better for their baby; 87% reported they would have little or no difficulty changing. Women who reported a non-left going-to-sleep position were more likely to be of Maori (aOR 2.64 95% CI 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR 2.91 95% CI 1.46-5.78) ethnicity; had a lower body mass index (BMI) (aOR 0.93 95% CI 0.89-0.96); and were less likely to sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR 3.29 95% CI 2.03-5.32).Conclusions: Maternal going-to-sleep position in the last week was side-lying in 91% of participants. The majority had received advice to sleep on their side or avoid supine sleep position. Sleeping on the left-hand side of the bed was associated with going-to-sleep on the left side. Most non-left sleepers reported their sleeping position could be modified to the left side suggesting a public health intervention about sleep position is likely to be feasible in other multi-ethnic communities.

AB  - Few studies have investigated maternal fatigue, particularly fatigue throughout the duration of pregnancy and the postpartum period. The purpose of this study was to explore changes related to maternal fatigue from pregnancy to postpartum and the factors influencing fatigue. This prospective longitudinal study surveyed 197 pregnant women beyond 24 gestational weeks monthly until one month postpartum. The Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale and one question about fatigue were used. Women at late pregnancy experienced a significant increase in level of fatigue, which remained high after childbirth. Those who were not happy about the pregnancy or were multiparas experienced a higher level of prenatal fatigue than their counterparts. At postpartum, mothers who were unemployed, had no one to help with childcare, or felt that the baby's night-time sleep pattern was a serious problem had a higher level of fatigue. Interventions can be planned and implemented at early pregnancy to reduce the prevalence of fatigue. Encouraging pregnant women to share experiences and thoughts about pregnancy and being a mother is suggested. Further studies that evaluate culturally sensitive instruments for fatigue are needed.

T2  - Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care
AB  - Background Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals' interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis. Results Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover. Conclusions This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested. ( BIRTH 40:1 March 2013)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The few existing early-life obesity prevention initiatives have concentrated on nutrition and physical activity, with little examination of sleep. METHODS: This community-based, randomized controlled trial allocated 802 pregnant women (≥16 years, <34 weeks' gestation) to: control, FAB (food, activity, and breastfeeding), sleep, or combination (both interventions) groups. All groups received standard well-child care. FAB participants received additional support (8 contacts) promoting breastfeeding, healthy eating, and physical activity (antenatal-18 months). Sleep participants received 2 sessions (antenatal, 3 weeks) targeting prevention of sleep problems, as well as a sleep treatment program if requested (6-24 months). Combination participants received both interventions (9 contacts). BMI was measured at 24 months by researchers blinded to group allocation, and secondary outcomes (diet, physical activity, sleep) were assessed by using a questionnaire or accelerometry at multiple time points. RESULTS: At 2 years, 686 women remained in the study (86%). No significant intervention effect was observed for BMI at 24 months (P= .086), but there was an overall group effect for the prevalence of obesity (P = .027). Exploratory analyses found a protective effect for obesity among those receiving the "sleep intervention" (sleep and combination compared with FAB and control: odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.82]). No effect was observed for the "FAB intervention" (FAB and combination compared with sleep and control: odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.81]). CONCLUSIONS: A well-developed food and activity intervention did not seem to affect children's weight status. However, further research on more intensive or longer running sleep interventions is warranted.

TI  - Technical Versus Public Spheres: A Feminist Analysis of Women’s Rhetoric in the Twilight Sleep Debates of 1914–1916.
AU  - Johnson, Bethany

T2  - Health Communication
AB  - Twilight Sleep (TS) describes the delivery, via an injection, of an amnestic drug cocktail to a parturient woman throughout labor. In order to understand the development of modern-day rhetoric surrounding childbirth methods and procedures, this article explores the debate over TS between the public and technical sphere in New York City between 1914 and 1916 and examines the ways in which this debate altered obstetric health care for middle- and upper-class White women. The public response to this campaign posed a direct challenge to male obstetricians in New York City, many of whom were ill-equipped, both literally and figuratively, to use this procedure. Using a feminist rhetorical criticism, we examined the pro-TS rhetoric of women writers in New York City, the methods they borrowed from the women’s movement, and the ensuing dialogue between the public and technical spheres. For this study, we analyzed journal and newspaper articles, a pamphlet, a collection of pro-TS organizational documents, letters to the editor, and books published about TS and the history of birth. Lastly, we analyzed theoretical notions of childbirth in women’s health and communication studies. After examining the TS debate, we found that birth practices for middle- and upper-class women in New York City shifted and the obstetric community gained ascendancy over female midwifery. We also found that in certain instances, the rhetoric of pro-TS activists was more technically accurate than the rhetoric of some physicians. Hence the TS debate emerged from an argument over the right to use technical language in the technical and/or the public sphere. Conclusions and implications offered by this historical, feminist analysis question our current understanding of women’s health and birthing practices, doctor–patient communication, and patient empowerment and access to technical knowledge.

AB  - Physical activity is associated with improved sleep quality and duration in the general population, but its effect on sleep in postpartum women is unknown. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hours/week of self-reported domain-specific and overall moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep quality and duration at 3- and 12-months postpartum among a cohort of 530 women in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Postpartum Study. MVPA was not associated with sleep quality or duration at 3-months postpartum. At 12-months postpartum, a 1 h/week increase in recreational MVPA was associated with higher odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (odds ratio, OR 1.14; 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1.03-1.27) and a 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA was associated with lower odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (OR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.88-0.99). A 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00-1.16) was associated with higher odds of long sleep duration and 1 h/week increases in indoor household (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.18) and overall MVPA (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) were associated with higher odds of short (vs. normal) sleep duration. Comparing 3-months postpartum to 12-months postpartum, increased work MVPA was associated with good sleep quality (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.12-5.15) and increased indoor household MVPA was associated with short sleep duration (OR 1.85, 95 % CI 1.05-3.27) as measured at 12-months postpartum. Selected domains of MVPA and their longitudinal increases were associated with sleep quality and duration at 12-months postpartum. Additional research is needed to elucidate whether physical activity can improve postpartum sleep.

AB  - Short sleep duration is associated with multiple adverse child outcomes. We examined associations of the built environment with infant sleep duration among 1226 participants in a pre-birth cohort. From residential addresses, we used a geographic information system to determine urbanicity, population density, and closeness to major roadways. The main outcome was mother's report of her infant's average daily sleep duration at 1 year of age. We ranked urbanicity and population density as quintiles, categorized distance to major roads into 8 categories, and used linear regression adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, fetal growth, and television viewing at 1 year. In this sample, mean (SD) sleep duration at age 1 year was 12.8 (1.6)h/day. In multivariable adjusted analyses, children living in the highest quintile of urbanicity slept -19.2 min/day (95% CI:-37.0, -1.50) less than those living in the lowest quintile. Neither population density nor closeness to major roadways was associated with infant sleep duration after multivariable adjustment. Our findings suggest that living in more urban environments may be associated with reduced infant sleep.

TI  - The Biopsychosocial Model of Metabolic Syndrome among U.S. Adults.
AU  - Saylor, Jennifer
AB  - Background: The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of medical disorders (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin/resistance/glucose intolerance) that characteristically occur together in individuals. The prevalence of MetS continues to increase in the U.S. and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Little research uses a theoretical model to identify direct or indirect contributions to MetS and predictors to MetS. Identifying the factors that influence MetS in a national sample is necessary to understand targets for intervention to prevent the MetS and its sequelae.Purpose: This study tested a hypothesized conceptual model of the biopsychosocial factors associated with MetS in adults using a representative sample.Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008 data from non-pregnant participants who were 20-80 years old and completed the questionnaire and medical examination with fasting laboratory data. The sample of 2,583 adults represented 212 million non-institutionalized civilian Americans living in the U.S. Path analysis was conducted to test the biopsychosocial model of MetS. Complex samples logistic regression models (CSLR) were utilized to examine the direct and indirect contributions of biomedical (age), biosocial (gender, race, education, income, and marital status), and psychosocial factors (depressive symptoms, diet, physical activity, smoking status, and sleep) to MetS.Results: Of the study population, 29% met the criteria for MetS and 95% had at least one component of MetS. The hypothesized model fit the nationally representative data. The parsimonious model with age, gender, race, education, income, depressive symptoms, physical activity, smoking, and the interaction between age and physical activity explained 25.2% of the variance in the presence of MetS. Mediating effects among the biosocial and psychosocial factors help explain their relationship with MetS.Conclusion: The study supported the hypothesized model and the contributions of biopsychosocial factors to MetS. The study indicated that certain demographic groups were vulnerable to MetS. More studies are needed to examine factors associated with MetS than were from the hypothesized model. Prospective studies are needed to improve psychosocial status and to prevent/reverse MetS.

T2  - Maternal & Child Health Journal
AB  - Not using the infant back sleep position is an established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk, particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged 2004-2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences. Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs.

AU  - McKenna, Helen
AU  - Reiss, Irwin Karl Marcel
T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Time of day is a critical factor for most biological functions, but concepts from the field of chronobiology have yet to be fully translated to clinical practice. Circadian rhythms, generated internally and synchronised to the external environment, promote function and support survival in almost every living species. Fetal circadian rhythms can be observed in utero from 30weeks gestation, coupled to the maternal rhythm, but synchronise to the external environment only after birth. Important cues for synchronisation include the light/dark cycle, the timing of feeding, and exposure to melatonin in breast milk. Disruption to these cues may occur during admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. This can impair the development of circadian rhythms, and influence survival and function in the neonatal period, with a potential to impact health and well-being throughout adult life. Here we outline the rationale and evidence to support a chronobiological approach to neonatal care.

T2  - Current Opinion in Obstetrics & Gynecology
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the clinical challenges of obesity in obstetrics from the anaesthetist's viewpoint. RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of obesity continues to increase both in the community and on the labour ward. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery are also on rise. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with hypertensive disease (chronic hypertension and preeclampsia), diabetes mellitus (pregestational and gestational), respiratory disorders (asthma and sleep apnoea), thromboembolic disease, caesarean section and infections (primarily urinary tract infections, wound infections and endometritis). Obesity is a risk factor for anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Obese women are not only at high-risk of airway complications, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, perioperative morbidity and mortality but also pose technical challenges. Obesity also influences the fetal outcomes. Increasing use of regional techniques contributes to the reduced anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Preconception counselling, antenatal screening and anaesthetic assessment are strongly encouraged. SUMMARY: Effective communication and good teamwork between an anaesthetist and an obstetrician are essential for the care of obese parturients. A more liberalized use of regional techniques may be a means of further reducing the anaesthesia-related maternal mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, and MIRLYN. STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies from 1 969 to 1997 were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and information was organized under the following areas: definition of and the interconnection between circadian rhythm and blood pressure; the circadian variability of blood pressure throughout the trimesters; the patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancies defined as normal and those complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia; and clinical implications. DATA SYNTHESIS: The circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancy is the same as in the non-pregnant state, with a nocturnal decrease, especially during sleep. In patients with chronic hypertension, the nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be steeper. Patients with mild preeclampsia may experience a less pronounced nocturnal decrease in blood pressure. Patients with severe preeclampsia may display a reversed circadian rhythm, with no decrease and/or an increase in nocturnal blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia warrant consideration when monitoring patients and implementing management plans.

AB  - Context: Disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep quality during pregnancy have been related to gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which affect postpartum glucose metabolism and future risk of type 2 diabetes.Objective: We assessed whether the circadian rhythm-related melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) genotype was associated with 1 to 5 years of postpartum glycemic changes among women with a history of GDM and whether gestational weight gain modified such associations.Design, Settings, and Participants: The established circadian rhythm-associated MTNR1B genetic variant (rs10830963) was genotyped in 1025 Chinese women with a history of GDM. Body weight and glycemic traits, during and after pregnancy, were longitudinally collected.Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measure was postpartum glycemic changes.Results: We found that women carrying different MTNR1B genotypes showed distinct postpartum changes in 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test: 0.36, 0.20, and -0.19 mM per additional copy of the shorter sleep duration-related G allele in women with inadequate, adequate, and excessive gestational weight gain, respectively (for interaction, P = 0.028). The corresponding changes in fasting glucose were 0.14, 0.13, and 0.01 mM, although the modification effect of gestational weight gain on the genetic association was marginally significant (for interaction, P = 0.067).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that gestational weight gain may modify the circadian rhythm-related MTNR1B genetic variant on long-term glycemic changes, highlighting the significance of gestational weight management in diabetes prevention among women with GDM.

AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the impact of the Southern Public Health Regions’ (Regions IV and IV) Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) to Reduce Infant Mortality, supported by the US Health Resources and Services Administration. Methods. We examined pre–post change (2011–2014) for CoIIN strategies with available outcome data from vital records (early elective delivery, smoking) and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (safe sleep) as well as preterm birth and infant mortality for Regions IV and VI relative to all other regions. Results. For most outcomes, CoIIN improvements were greater in Regions IV and VI than in other regions. For example, early elective delivery decreased by 22% versus 14% in other regions, smoking cessation during pregnancy increased by 7% versus 2%, and back sleep position increased by 5%versus 2%. Preterm birth decreased by 4%, twice that observed in other regions, but infant mortality reductions did not differ significantly. Conclusions. The CoIIN approach to public health improvement shows promise in accelerating progress in intermediate outcomes and preterm birth. Impact on infant mortality may require additional strategies and sustained efforts.

AB  - Background: Chronic pelvic pain has often been described as a major women's health issue, but no information exists on the extent of the problem in the United Kingdom. Aim: To investigate the community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and its effect on the lives of consulting and non-consulting women. Design Of Study: Postal questionnaire survey. Setting: Women aged 18 to 49 (n = 3916) randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register. Method: The questionnaire response rate (adjusted for non-deliveries) was 74% (2304/3106). Chronic pelvic pain was defined as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of at least six months' duration, unrelated to periods, intercourse, or pregnancy. Case subgroups comprised recent consulters, past consulters, and non-consulters. Women who reported dysmenorrhoea alone formed a comparison group. Results: The three-month prevalence of chronic pelvic pain was 24.0% (95% CI = 22.1% to 25.8%). One-third of women reported pain that started more than five years ago. Recent consulters (32% of cases) were most affected by their symptoms in terms of pain severity, use of health care, physical and mental health scores, sleep quality, and pain-related absence from work. Non-consulters (41% of cases) did not differ from women with dysmenorrhoea in terms of symptom-related impairment. Irrespective of consulting behaviour, a high rate of symptom-related anxiety was found in women with chronic pelvic pain (31%) compared with women with dysmenorrhoea (7%). Conclusions: This study showed a high community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Cases varied substantially in the degree to which they were affected by their symptoms. The high symptom-related anxiety in these women emphasises the need for more information about chronic pelvic pain and its possible causes.

TI  - The contribution of physical activity to sleep parameters in pregnancy within the context of prepregnant body mass index.
AU  - Nodine, Priscilla M
AB  - Sleep disturbances are common among pregnant women and pregnant women with obesity are especially prone to problems sleeping. Disturbed sleep is independently associated with the inflammatory process and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Safe treatment options to enhance sleep during pregnancy are needed. The primary aim of the study was to test Pender's Health Promotion Model (HPM) by evaluating the contribution of physical activity (PA) to sleep parameters in pregnant women, particularly within the context of prepregnant body mass index (BMI). Twenty-nine sedentary women in the second trimester were enrolled in an 8-week PA intervention pilot study and randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Survey data, including the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), provided descriptive data. Steps per day, as measured by pedometer, and sleep parameters (sleep onset latency [SOL], wake time after sleep onset [WASO], total sleep time [TST], and sleep quality), obtained from sleep diaries, collected for 3 days at the beginning and end of the program, were used to evaluate the daily interaction between PA levels and sleep in pregnancy. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used for analysis, as data were nested within persons. No significant change occurred over the course of the study in either PA levels or sleep parameters. Prepregnant BMI contributed negatively to PA levels (p = 0 0033), PA levels were positively predictive (p = 0.037) of sleep onset latency (SOL) and negatively predictive (p = 0.01) of sleep quality, demonstrating a negative effect of PA on sleep when measured daily. These results contradict findings from other studies that evaluated the PA level-sleep relationship over a week or month. Small sample and selection bias may have contributed to these results. The effect of daily PA level on sleep during pregnancy may have time-of-day, dose, and intensity components that need further study.

AB  - ypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research.

AB  - Background: The article was designed to estimate the effect of active and passive household cigarette smoke exposure on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with asthma.Methods: We used a secondary observational analysis of pregnant women with mild and moderate-severe asthma enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study of asthma in pregnancy and a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing inhaled beclomethasone and oral theophylline. A baseline questionnaire detailing smoking history and passive household smoke exposure was given to each patient. Smoking status was confirmed in the RCT using cotinine levels. Data on asthma severity and obstetric and neonatal outcomes were collected and analyzed with respect to self-reported tobacco smoke exposure. Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson chi(2) statistics were used to test for significance.Results: A total of 2,210 women were enrolled: 1,812 in the observational study and 398 in the RCT. Four hundred and eight (18%) women reported current active smoking. Of the nonsmokers, 790 (36%) women reported passive household smoke exposure. Active smoking was associated with more total symptomatic days (P < .001) and nights of sleep disturbance (P < .001). Among the newborns of active smokers, there was a greater risk of small for gestational age < 10th percentile (P < .001), and a lower mean birth weight (P < .001). There were no differences in symptom exacerbation or outcome between nonsmokers with and without passive household cigarette smoke exposure.Conclusions: Among pregnant women with asthma, active but not passive smoking is associated with increased asthma symptoms and fetal growth abnormalities.

TI  - The effect of an educational intervention in women with gestational diabetes: A pilot study.
AU  - Amason, Janeen S
AB  - Women with gestational diabetes (GD) are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (DM) after delivery compared to those without GD. Numerous studies in the general population have identified that adoption of healthy lifestyles can prevent DM; however limited research has focused on women with GD. The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of an educational intervention of SUGAR (S?tart U?nderstanding G?estational Diabetes a?nd R?isk of Type 2 Diabetes), on women's perceived risk of developing DM, knowledge of DM, self-efficacy to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors after childbirth among women with GD.A total of 23 women (mean age of 29.7+/-3.9), 18 in SUGAR group and 5 in control group (CG) completed self-reported standardized questionnaires (Risk Perception Survey for Developing Diabetes adapted for women with GD; Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices; Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile II; General Sleep Disturbance Scale; and Demographic Questionnaire) at baseline (third trimester) and post-test (postpartum 6- 8 weeks). Intervention was given post the baseline data collection with a booster session at 2-4 weeks postpartum. The women in CG received attention control treatment.Study participants were obese (BMI M-33.1, SD-7.7) and a majority had a family history of DM. Findings showed that self-efficacy was the single significant predictor and accounted for 22% of the variance of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Participants had a clinical significant sleep disturbance during both pregnancy and postpartum. At baseline, poor sleepers reported a lower self-efficacy. The intervention significantly increased DM knowledge for women in the SUGAR group; however, not for perceived risk, self-efficacy nor healthy lifestyle behaviors. There was no difference between groups for postpartum glucose screening rates with only 39% receiving recommended testing.Future research needs to focus on prevention programs and center on self-efficacy, postpartum glucose screening, improve sleep, and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. To ensure a better preventive care for GD women, education provided for both patients and health care provider is needed.

TI  - The effect of cycled light versus continuous near darkness on growth and development of preterm infants born at less than 31 weeks gestation.
AU  - Brandon DH
AB  - Preterm infants' outcomes vary with illness and degree of neurological insult. Evidence suggests that continuous bright light levels in particular, may have negative effects on growth and development. However, little data exists to suggest how much and when light stimulation is appropriate. This study utilized a longitudinal randomized experimental design to examine the timing and effects of cycled light and continuous near darkness throughout hospitalization on the health and development of preterm infants <31 weeks gestation. Sixty two infants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: near darkness from birth to 32 weeks gestation followed by cycled light until discharge, cycled light throughout hospitalization, or near darkness throughout the hospitalization with cycled light at 36 weeks gestation in preparation for discharge.This study failed to reveal any significant benefits of near darkness over cycled light from birth for weight gain, length of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, neurobehavioral development, and sleep-wake states outcomes. The weight gain of the group of infants that received cycled light from birth was greater, though not significantly so, than the weight gain for infants receiving near darkness until 36 weeks gestation. Infants receiving near darkness until 36 weeks gestation developed more severe ROP throughout hospitalization and more elevated heart rates than the infants receiving cycled light from birth. In addition, infants receiving near darkness at birth followed by cycled light at 32 weeks gestation had significantly more failures on the BAER than infants receiving near darkness followed by cycled light at 36 weeks gestation. Yet, there were no differences in the number of BAER failures between the infants receiving cycled light from birth and the infants receiving near darkness followed by cycled light at 36 weeks.The findings of this study consistently supported the idea that continuous near darkness for hospitalized preterm infants has no significant advantages over cycled light. Future research should continue the direction begun by this study to ascertain the most appropriate time to begin cycled light in the neonatal environment and optimal level of illumination during day lighting.

AB  - Aim: To compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of labetalol and nifedipine modified release (MR) in hypertensive pregnant women. We also investigated the effect on the heart rate (HR) and determined the proportion of time spent in target.Methods: This was an exploratory study. Women with chronic hypertension taking either labetalol or nifedipine were offered 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Sleep, wake and drug ingestion times were self-reported. An indirect response model was used to analyse the systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and HR time-series; the effect of gestation and type of drug was evaluated.Results: Forty-eight women were recruited: 24 in each group. There was no difference in clinical characteristics. In women taking nifedipine there was a positive association between the dose of nifedipine and pre-dose BP p = .002, this was not present in the labetalol group. There was a difference between the drug effects on both the SBP and DBP time-series (p = .014). In comparison to labetalol, there was less variation in day time BP in those women prescribed nifedipine. Women on labetalol spent a larger proportion of time with their DBP below target (<80 mmHg). The HR dynamics were qualitatively different, a stimulatory effect was found with nifedipine compared to an inhibitory effect with labetalol.Conclusion: There are significant and important differences between the BP lowering effects of nifedipine and labetalol. A large randomised control trial is required to investigate the relationship between BP variability and time in target on pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of leptin and other selected variables on gestational weight gain (GWG) according to pre-gestational body mass index (BMI).Design: Prospective cohort.Setting: Public Health Center, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Sample: Two hundred and twenty-eight pregnant women.Methods: Women were followed at the 5-13, 20-26 and 30-36th gestational weeks. The effects of independent variables on GWG in normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) ), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2) ) and obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m(2) ) women were assessed using longitudinal linear mixed-effects models.Main Outcome Measure: Maternal body weight (kg) throughout pregnancy.Results: Leptin concentrations were associated with GWG in normal weight (β = 0.048, P < 0.001) and overweight (β = 0.023, P = 0.048) women, but not in obese ones (β = 0.011, P = 0.308). Additionally, the number of hours slept per night decreased the effect of leptin on GWG in OW women (β = -0.013, P = 0.002). The effect of other maternal characteristics on GWG was different depending on the BMI category.Conclusions: Leptin concentrations were positively associated with GWG in normal weight and overweight women, but not in obese ones. Maternal height was associated with GWG in all BMI categories, but other variables such as sleep duration, QUICKI values, HDL-c, smoking habit and marital status presented differential effects according to BMI. We encourage further studies to investigate the association between leptin and gestational weight gain, taking into account the pre-pregnancy weight and sleep duration, in order to compare and confirm our results.Tweetable Abstract: Leptin is associated with weight gain in normal weight and overweight pregnant women, but not in obese ones.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To determine the effect of maternal presence on the physiological and behavioral status of the preterm infant when exposed to recorded music versus ambient sound. Design Repeated-measures randomized controlled trial. Setting Special care nursery (SCN) in a tertiary perinatal center. Participants Clinically stable preterm infants (22) born at > 28 weeks gestation and enrolled at > 32 weeks gestation and their mothers. Methods Infants were exposed to lullaby music (6 minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6 minutes recorded lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12 minutes (baseline and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent overall. Results There was no discernible infant response to music and therefore no significant impact of maternal presence on infant's response to music over time. However during the mothers' presence (first 12 minutes), the infants exhibited significantly higher oxygen saturation than during their absence p = .024) and less time spent in quiet sleep after their departure, though this was not significant. Conclusion Infants may have been unable to detect the music against the ambient soundscape. Regardless of exposure to music, the infants' physiological and behavioral regulation were affected by the presence and departure of the mothers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the effect of maternal sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) on infant general movements (GMs) and neurodevelopment. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with uncomplicated full-term pregnancies and their offspring were prospectively recruited from a community and hospital low-risk obstetric surveillance. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire on second trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (WatchPAT; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea hypopnea index >5) and controls. Infant GMs were assessed in the first 48 hours and at 8-11 and 14-16 weeks of age. At 12 months of age the Infant Developmental Inventory and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire were administered. RESULTS: In all, 74 women and their full-term infants were studied. Eighteen (24%) women had SDB. Mean birthweight was 3347.1 ± 423.9 g. Median Apgar score at 5 minutes was 10 (range, 8-10). In adjusted comparisons, no differences were found between infants born to mothers with SDB and controls in GM scores in all 3 evaluations. Low social developmental score was detected at 12 months in 64% of infants born to SDB mothers compared to 25% of infants born to controls (adjusted P = .036; odds ratio, 16.7). Infant snoring was reported by 41.7% of mothers with SDB compared to 7.5% of controls (P = .004). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that maternal SDB during pregnancy has no adverse effect on neonatal and infant neuromotor development but may affect social development at 1 year.

AB  - Objective: To examine the relationship between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and smoking during pregnancy; postnatal tobacco smoke exposure from the mother, father, live-in-adults, and day care providers; and postnatal smoke exposure from breast-feeding.Design: Case-control study.Setting: Five counties in Southern California.Participants: A total of 200 white, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian parents of infants who died of SIDS between 1989 and 1992 were compared with 200 control parents who delivered healthy infants. Case infants were matched to control infants on the basis of birth hospital, birth date, gender, and race. All information was obtained from a detailed telephone interview and validated with medical records.Main Outcome Measures: Risk of SIDS associated with passive smoking by the mother, father, live-in adults, and day care providers; smoking in the same room as the infant; total number of cigarettes smoked by all adults; and maternal smoking during the time period of breast-feeding.Results: Conditional logistic regression resulted in overall adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for SIDS associated with passive smoke from the mother of 2.28, the father of 3.46, other live-in adults of 2.18, and all sources of 3.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.81 to 6.75), while simultaneously adjusting for birth weight, sleep position, prenatal care, medical conditions at birth, breast-feeding, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. A dose-response effect was noted for SIDS associated with increasing numbers of cigarettes, as well as total number of smokers. Breast-feeding was protective for SIDS among nonsmokers (OR = 0.37) but not smokers (OR = 1.38), when adjusting for potential confounders.Conclusions: Passive smoking in the same room as the infant increases the risk for SIDS. Physicians should educate new and prospective parents about the risk of tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life.

AB  - Objective To assess the effects of relaxation exercises on subjective sleep quality of in third-trimester pregnant women. Materials and methods The pretest posttest randomized controlled trial recruited 84 pregnant women in the third trimester. Following random assignment of subjects, the treatment group (n = 46) performed relaxation exercises for four weeks and the control group (n = 46) received standart cares. At baseline and after the intervention sleep quality was assessed. Data obtained were analyzed in SPSS. Results The mean score of the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was 7.12 ± 3.66. It was determined that relaxation exercises improved some sleep quality subscales including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction and global sleep quality. The difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion A four -week compact disc guide relaxation exercises program can be effective in improving sleep quality.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Low back pain is one of the most common complaints in pregnancy which interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Sitting Pelvic Tilt Exercise on physical disability in primigravidas with low back pain during the third trimester. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was carried out on 60 primigravidas who attended in 3 prenatal clinics of Zanjan University of medical science. At first, 60 primigravidas were selected by simple sampling and randomly divided into two groups: case and control. Only the experimental group did the sitting pelvic tilt exercise program for 8 weeks during the third trimester. Data was collected for both groups by interview using VAS scale and Disability Rating Index (DRI) on the days 0 and 56 (pre and post intervention). Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, occupation, education and BMI and intensity of physical disability before the intervention. However, intensity of physical disability significantly decreased (p<0.0001) in the experimental group after the exercise program. Adversely, the intensity of physical disability increased in the control group as pregnancy proceed (p<0.0001). Intensity of low back pain was also reduced in the experimental group after the sitting pelvic tilt exercise program comparing to pre treatment stage and also in comparison with the control group (P<0.0001). Conclusion: It seems that use of exercise programs such as 'sitting pelvic tilt exercise' is an effective method in pregnant women who suffer from low back pain and related disabilities but do not want to use aggressive treatments and chemical pain relief drugs.

AB  - In regards to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Obesity, there is a worldwide pandemic causing great concern over these evolving and increasing diseases. 1 Statistics reflect that T2DM accounts for 85-90% of all cases of diabetes 1 around the world and one in ten adults are considered obese. 2 Worldwide approximations also reveal that 50% of the world's population is at risk of being vitamin D deficient. 3 The global rise in T2DM can be attributed to a change toward a western lifestyle leading to increases in overweight and obesity, which in turn promote insulin resistance. 4 Evidence of micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin D deficiency may also affect endocrine cells thus possibly leading to the increased risk of developing T2DM. 4 Epidemiological evidence supporting an inverse relationship between T2DM, obesity, and vitamin D deficiency (VDD), 5-11 may reveal a common denominator in regards to risk for metabolic processes. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) refers to impairment in insulin secretion and differing degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. 15 Terms for DM classification have changed due to overlap in the age groups and respective treatments. 12 Outdated terms such as juvenile or adult onset diabetes have been replaced with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM.12 The international committee has determined that a Hemoglobin A1C (HGA1C) of 6.5% or above should be used for the diagnosis of diabetes. 14 There are two main types of DM; Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (TIDM) and T2DM. 15 Symptomatic hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are typical of T1DM however, T2DM may not present with outright hyperglycemia. 15 Many times T2DM is detected during routine testing. 15 This review will use the HGA1C assay to determine glycemic control. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The estimated worldwide incidence of individuals with diabetes was approximately 366 million in 2011 and is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030. 1 The growing epidemic of T2DM has prompted global concern 1,2 with a call for awareness, prevention and improved management of the disease. Experts speculate that the increased incidence in T2DM is a product of globalization, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. 1 The estimated worldwide incidence of diabetes was approximately 366 million in 2011 and is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030. 1 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus can lead to illness and a taxing financial burden, with T2DM contributing to over 20% of all deaths after the age of 49 for all regions of the world during 2011. 1 Worldwide estimates of health expenditures in 2010 accounted for $376 billion in T2DM related illnesses. 1 Projected costs by 2030 are expected to reach $490 billion without a concerted effort to control this disease. 1 In 2010, 1.9 million new cases of T2DM were diagnosed in the United States 12 and currently there are 25.8 million adults and children with all types of diabetes with at least 7.0 million people not yet diagnosed. 12 The growing epidemic of T2DM is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among people between the ages of 20 and 74 years of age. 12 People living with T2DM suffer from multiple complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and neuropathies associated with the disease. 12 The total cost of T2DM in the U.S. for the year 2007 was $174 billion 12 and costs continue to rise in spite of educational programs. Worldwide efforts to reduce the financial and physiological burden of T2DM 1,2,12,13 exist, but have been unsuccessful. Researchers have been working diligently toward an efficient and economical alternative to the current status quo when it comes to traditional anti-diabetic treatment. Latest guideline changes to diagnosing and monitoring diabetes were announced during the 69th American Diabetic Association's (ADA) annual Scientific Session in 2009. 14 During this session, the ADA, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and European Association fo Overweight, Obesity, and Body Mass Index The substantial impact of obesity on subsequent metabolic disorders is a complex situation that requires further investigation. Obesity, now considered a chronic disease, is linked to hypertension, T2DM, insulin resistance, joint issues, and obstructive sleep apnea. 16 An energy imbalance is the best way to describe obesity; it means that the energy consumption out weights the energy expenditure 17 Overweight and obesity are defined as “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health”. 2 BMI is determined by a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters. 1The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight as a body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 25 (kilograms per meters squared) kg/m2 and obesity as greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. In 1980, over 1.5 million adults across the globe were considered overweight and the numbers have doubled. 2 Approximately 2.8 million deaths, 13 44% of diabetes, and 23% of heart disease cases are attributed to overweight and obesity across the globe.13 Disparities across all countries reflect that women with less education were two to three times more likely to be obese or overweight versus women with higher education. 18 Approximately 25% of the population in England are obese as well as 18% in Hungary and 15% in Spain and Ireland. 18 Adult Americans with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or greater are estimated at about 149.3 million. 16 The worldwide financial burden accounts for approximately 0.7% - 2.8% of total health-care costs 16 and American health-care costs related to obesity estimated to reach $861-957 billion by 2030. 13 By lowering BMI by 5 %, millions of dollars in healthcare costs could be saved. 18 Vitamin D Vitamin D, discovered in the 1700s, was not only used to cure rickets and improve osteomalacia 19 but since then has been associated with a reduction in cancer risk, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders, T1DM, and T2DM. 20 Investigators have also found increased levels of Vitamin D3 to be associated with reduced mortality rates of all causes. 20 In 1940, a physician researcher investigating skin cancer and sunlight discovered an inverse relationship between increased sunlight exposure and decreased incidence of all types of cancers except skin cancer. 21 That introduction into the biological effects of sunlight on cancer mortality rates, spurred interest in Vitamin D. The impetus for further investigation of Vitamin D began to evolve in 1970, when Holick 8 isolated 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 into the active form 1,25-dihydroxivitamin D3. 22 His seminal work 22 in this field revealed that many tissues and cells in the body have Vitamin D receptors (VDR) and thus have the ability of converting circulating Vitamin D or 25-hydroxyvitamin (D 25(OH)D3) to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). 8 There are two forms of Vitamin D; 19 they are Vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Plants synthesize ergocalciferol and the skin, when exposed to ultraviolet sunlight, synthesizes cholecalciferol. 19 Vitamin D3 deficiency is linked to a lack of ultraviolet B rays from the sun, use of sun block, increased skin pigmentation, seasonal variation, location of the sun, latitude, aging, and obesity. 23 Metabolism of Vitamin D involves conversion in the liver and the kidneys. Sufferers of chronic diseases such as diabetes, pancreatitis, celiac disease, and diseases taxing the liver and kidneys are at greater risk of Vitamin D deficiency. 19 Vitamin D status is classified as: 25(OH)D deficiency < 20 ng/ml, insufficiency 21-29ng/ml; and a normal level at 30ng/ml. 8 The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults aged 18-70 is 600IU/day and for those over 70, the RDA is 800IU/day. 24 The RDA upper limit for Vitamin D supplementation in adults over 18 years of age is 4000IU/day. 24 The best predictor of Vitamin D status is determined by measuring 25(OH)D3 in the blood. The circulating form of Vitamin D, 25(OH)D3, in the blood exists for approximately 2-3 weeks, thus providing a more accurate serum Vitamin D level than the active form 1,25-(OH)2D3 8 which is only available for measurement for about 2-4 hours. 8 Obesity, Vitamin D, and Type 2 diabetes Mellitus It is believed that Vitamin D may assist in improving glycemic control by improving insulin production and secretion. 20 It is hypothesized that vitamin D may inhibit pancreatic beta cell dysfunction by protecting islet cells from destruction. 7 Preliminary research has found an inverse relationship between Vitamin D status and obesity. 5 Vitamin D deficiency in the obese population offers an intriguing perspective. Vitamin D is fat-soluble, behaves like a hormone, and is sequestered in adipose tissue. 23, 25 It has been hypothesized that the greater the fat mass the greater the Vitamin D deficiency. 5 Obesity, a disease associated in the pathophysiology of T2DM, is a consequence of over nutrition and sedentary life-style in those with a genetic predisposition. 26 Demise of the islet beta cell is said to be caused by over nutrition and inactivity. 27 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and pancreatic beta cell dysregulation. 4 Commonalities between T2DM and obesity involve systemic vascular inflammation. 28 Over nutrition promotes adipose tissue inflammation and beta cell stress; these cellular responses cause insulin signaling impairment and possible subsequent development of T2DM. 17, 28 Cellular responses in organs stemming from inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. 28 Other contributing factors to this inflammation 28 involve changes in environment, lifestyle, sleep deprivation, and diets low in fiber. Systemic vascular inflammation increases with age and is more pronounced and prolonged in those at risk for T2DM. 28 Vitamin D activity in the beta cells is potentiated by the activation of Vitamin D receptors (VDR) located in the pancreas, this in turn allows for a reduction in systemic inflammation. 29 The global increase in obesity and the possible relationship to VDD may present a unique opportunity to impact T2DM at the onset. 5 Current medications such as Byetta and Victoza, which affect both glycemic control and obesity, may present obstacles to treatment such as unfavorable side effects like nausea, emesis, headache, diarrhea 30,31 and a potential risk for pancreatitis, 30 renal insufficiency, 30 and/or thyroid tumor. 31 In a commentary on the link between Vitamin D deficiency and T2DM, the reviewer reports that Vitamin D depletion may have dose related effects on glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and insulin resistance. 32 Vitamin D supplemented at the higher dose limit 23 may be a less expensive and effective treatment to harness obesity in the T2DM adult. A preliminary search of the Joanna Briggs Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Pub Med, and PROSPERO has revealed a number of reviews covering the link between VDD and various disease processes which include T2DM and obesity. Mitri et al. 6 conducted a meta-analysis that included different levels of evidence correlating high levels of Vitamin D with a 43% lower risk of developing T2DM. In 2010, Renzaho et al. 9 conducted a review focusing on VDD and its relation to obesity, T2DM, and/or cardiovascular disease in which they 9 reported that ethnic minorities from various countries had significant VDD. The results also showed an inverse relation between Vitamin D status and obesity; however, the strength of the studies was limited due to the various tools used for determining body fat and not necessarily BMI. 9 A recent review 3 included a mix of multi-level resear fasting glucose. A review conducted by Alvarez et al. 10 also found an inverse relationship between Vitamin D and T2DM; however, dose-dependent glycemic control was not detailed. Another review 11 on the relationship between VDD, obesity, and T2DM found that women who received Vitamin D and Calcium supplementation had less weight gain and smaller waist circumference at a 7 year follow-up versus the placebo group. The results from this were difficult to isolate due to the inclusion of Calcium-Vitamin D supplementation combinations. 11 As there have been several systematic reviews to gain understanding of the relationship between Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, this systematic review will narrow its focus to investigate the effect of Vitamin D in the non-pregnant, obese, VDD adult with T2DM. This review aims to determine what effect vitamin D supplementation has on glycemic control and obesity in the T2DM adult by measurements of HGA1C and BMI, respectively.

T2  - British Journal of Developmental Disabilities
AB  - Supplementation during pregnancy forms a vital part of the well-being and development of the unborn child as well as the mother. Very often different brands of over-the-counter vitamins and minerals are taken, without considering the possibility of exceeding the maximum daily allowance, particularly where it concerns fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A. Although many people are aware of the consequences of taking too little vitamin A, this fat-soluble vitamin is stored in the body and over-dosage may occur when taking high doses. In this paper we investigate the effects of hypo- and hypervitaminosis A on craniofacial structures, lungs, hearts, limbs and the kidneys as well as the involvement in foetal nervous system development and post-natal sensorimotor functioning. Furthermore, we discuss how hypo- and hypervitaminosis A may affect the midline and lateral parts of the cerebellum, vermis, flocculi, ganglionic cell layer as well as the suprachiasmatic nucleas of the brain. Changes in the functioning of these areas due to hypo- and hypervitaminosis A, may lead to developmental and learning disabilities involving all forms of motor learning, vestibular functioning, eye and visual system deficits, disrupted sleep rhythms as well as altered mood and emotional processes.

TI  - The effects of maternal anxiety or stress during pregnancy on the fetus and the long-term development of the child.
AU  - Glover V
T2  - Nutrition & Health
AB  - There is evidence from several prospective studies that stress during pregnancy can affect the behavioural, emotional and cognitive development of the fetus and the child. Animal models suggest that this may be mediated via the HPA axis. Interventions to reduce stress in pregnant women are now a priority. Large prospective studies are providing increasing independent evidence that maternal stress/anxiety during pregnancy can affect fetal brain development, having adverse effects on the child's emotional, behavioural and cognitive development. It is suggested that the function of fetal programming is linked with a predictive adaptive response. Environmental influences on the mother are preparing the child in her womb for the external environment it is likely to inhabit. This is different from the genetic changes and mutations which will be effective for many generations. These affect circadian rhythm including sleep habit, and other aspects including laterality and sexuality. Their seriousness is now well enough established to feature in an American Child Health strategic plan 2005-10. Animal studies have provided a basis for human studies.. Antenatal maternal stress in rats leads to anxiety in the offspring. It can alter laterality -- right-handedness etc -- and sexuality, and disrupt the circadian rhythm including sleep pattern. Prenatal stress reduces the animal's later negative feedback, the calming effect of cortisol, by reducing the cortisol receptors in the hippocampus. In monkeys likewise, maternal prenatal stress leaves the offspring with a lower attention span and more anxiety. There are greater cortisol responses, and imaging also reveals more dopamine receptors to be affected by that stress neurotransmitter. So there is objective evidence of mammalian prenatal stress effects on offspring. In a group of anxious mothers, a simple arithmetic exercise met with a rise in fetal heart-beat, showing that maternal stress clearly affects the fetus. Dr Glover's human research has made use of the ALSPAC community study program. The strongest effects discerned of maternal prenatal stress on the offspring were on behavioural and emotional problems.. The strength of effect was stronger from stress at 32 weeks prenatally than 18 weeks, and resulted in double the levels of the offspring's hyperactivity, and emotional and conduct disorders. The children of anxious mothers in late pregnancy had high waking level of cortisol. In a separate study her group has shown that prenatal stress can affect the child's cognitive development also. In this study it was stress due to relationship problems with the partner, particularly emotional cruelty and separation, which had the largest effect on the child. Studies show that stress acts on the hypothalamus to produce corticotrophin releasing hormone, which in turn acts on the pituitary gland to produce adreno-corticotrophic hormone. This stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete cortisol for negative feedback to the hippocampus to stabilise the system. Yet both maternal and fetal cortisol are a positive stimulus on placental CRH. These results suggest the importance of detecting and treating affective disorder and relationship stress during pregnancy, both for the direct benefit to the mother herself, and particularly to help reduce later development of behavioural and other problems in children.

AU  - Rossi AC
AU  - D'Addario V
T2  - American Journal of Perinatology
AB  - Severity of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is classified in five stages according to Quintero staging. However, the efficacy of such staging was recently debated. We reviewed the efficacy of Quintero staging to predict survival rate in TTTS treated with laser therapy. Articles reporting survival rate for each stage in TTTS treated with laser therapy were reviewed. Number of twins alive per pregnancy (NAP) was compared between early (I + II) and advanced (III + IV) stages and within stages. Meta-analysis was performed according to Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Heterogeneity was tested with chi-square for heterogeneity at a significance level of P < 0.10, and random or fixed models were generated as appropriate. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. NAP was similar between early (zero survivors: 34/228, 15%; one survivor: 49/228, 21%; two survivors: 145/228, 63%) and advanced stages (zero survivors: 38/214, 18%; one survivor: 64/214, 30%; two survivors: 112/214, 52%; P > 0.05) except for one survivor ( P < 0.05). A trend for increased NAP was observed in all stages. Because clinically relevant differences were not observed, laser therapy is the optimal treatment for all stages. As Quintero staging does not provide information about prognosis, a new staging system is proposed.

AB  - Introduction: temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is characterized by pain in temporomandibular joint (TMJ), limited range of motion of the jaw and neck, tinnitus, joint noises, strength defi cits, fatigue and muscle pain, headaches and presence of parafunctional habits. Manual therapy aims, through techniques of manipulation, mobilization and specific exercises, to stimulate proprioception, to produce elasticity to adhered fibers, to stimulate synovial fluid and to promote the reduction of pain. Objective: to analyze the effects of manual therapy in the temporomandibular disorder. Method: review of the literature published between 2000 and 2010 in the databases Elsevier, Scielo and Bireme using the descriptors manual therapy, mobilization, manipulation and temporomandibular joint. It were excluded the articles that mentionated the treatment of patients with previous or current history of cancer, severe heart disease, epilepsy or pregnancy. Sample of 27 articles. Results: the articles reported positive effects in reducing pain, improving mobility, psychological aspects, sleep, ears symptoms, chewing and speaking. Although favourable results have been found, a limiting factor in these studies of manual therapy is the lack of detailed description of the techniques used given that the terms manual therapy, mobilization and manipulation are generic and may include different forms of passive movement. Conclusion: the physical therapy intervention by techniques of manual therapy was effective in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders, in the pain relief and improved the quality of life of the parients. New studies are suggested about the effects related to different techniques of manual therapy used to treat these disorders.

AB  - Introduction The Maternal Infant Health Outreach Worker (MIHOW) program is a home visiting program, utilizing peer mentors to improve maternal/child health outcomes in underserved communities. Findings are presented from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of the MIHOW model in a sample of Hispanic women in Tennessee. We hypothesized maternal and infant outcomes would be better in women assigned to MIHOW than women assigned to the minimal education intervention (MEI) group (receipt of educational materials). Methods Women entered the study during pregnancy (< 26 weeks gestation) and were followed through 6 months postpartum. A total of 188 women were enrolled and randomly assigned (MEI = 94; MIHOW = 94), with 178 women completing the study (MEI = 87; MIHOW = 91). Results Positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) effects of MIHOW were observed on breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, levels of depressive symptoms and parenting stress, safe sleep practices, and infant stimulation in the home. No statistically significant differences were noted in number of prenatal visits. Discussion Results expand limited empiric evidence and provide strong support of the effectiveness of MIHOW on improving health outcomes in this sample of Hispanic mothers and their infants. MIHOW is a viable option for providing culturally sensitive services to immigrant and underserved families.

TI  - The experience of mothers and fathers with their premature infant in the family home.
AU  - Wollenhaupt, Josanne M
AB  - The purpose of this exploratory study was to answer the question: 'What is the experience of mothers and fathers with their premature infant in the family home?' The purposive sample consisted of matched sets of mothers and fathers in ten families who were mother and father living together in a committed relationship, whether married or not; over the age of 18 years; and who were English speaking; parent of infant born between 32 and 37 weeks gestation who was hospitalized between one and three weeks, having no obvious birth defects; at discharge requiring no more than 1-2 medications, and no supplemental oxygen.This was an exploratory study using methods of naturalistic inquiry described by Lincoln and Guba (1985). The ongoing process of Finding the Rhythm in Our New Family emerged from data analysis. This process permeated the experience beginning with the disruption brought on by the early birth. In the three to five weeks following the discharge of the premature infant from the NICU, the process continued with mothers and fathers identifying patterns in their family, constructing routines and beginning reconnection with family, friends and the outside world. The eight themes contributing to the process are: Feeling the disruption; Riding the emotional roller coaster, Seeing myself as parent; feeling the part; Figuring out the (premature) baby; Surviving on combat sleep; Evolving as a parenting couple; I left the NICU, has the NICU left me?; Reconnecting with life within and outside the family. The mothers and fathers in this study experienced the process in different ways and were at different places in relation to their identification of the rhythms of their new family. The findings reveal what parents experience in living at home with premature infants generally considered 'healthy' by clinicians. The findings related to process and themes are foundational for future research. Future studies could have as primary focus: parents' experience of GE reflux; the apnea monitor at home; surviving on combat sleep or more in-depth study of the experience of fathers.

AB  - Background: Research shows that obesity prevention has to start early. Targeting interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight in children aged 2-6 years, who are yet normal weight, but have high predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and quantity.Methods/design: Based on information from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n = 5,902) were randomized into three groups; an intervention group, a shadow control group followed in registers exclusively, and a control group examined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Approximately 21% agreed to participate. Children who presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study (n = 92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the shadow control group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The intervention took place over on average 1½ year between 2009 and 2011, and consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4-7 day questionnaire diaries and objective measurements.Discussion: If the Healthy Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight and obesity at an early age.

TI  - The hospitalized preterm labor patient: perceptions of stressors, supports, and other psychological factors.
AU  - Graf RA
AB  - A descriptive design was used to explore the psychological aspects of the antepartal hospitalization experience for preterm labor patients. Patient's perceptions of stressors and supports during hospitalization were assessed. A convenience sample of 30 multigravida women were used for the study sample. Patients hospitalized a minimum of four days or more participated in a semi-structured interview to assess their perceptions. A modified Sarason Life Experience Survey (LES) and a Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS), was administered following the interviews. Quantitative methods for analysis of the demographic, LES, and JCS data were done using descriptive statistics. Qualitative analysis of the audiotaped interviews were performed using the naturalistic paradigm. These hospitalized women reported people, events and issues as stressors. Critical areas identified were: environmental confinement, difficulty in interpersonal communications, loss of control, isolation and loss of the parental role. The primary means of support reported by these hospitalized women were people. Interactions and relationships that these women had with their immediate family and friends provided this support. Care given by the nurses and doctors in stabilizing the patient's medical condition and maintaining the pregnancy was critical. A greater number of negative life events than positive were identified in these women. Negative life events with the greatest impact were: change in sleep habits, recreation, other events, and social activities. Coping styles utilized and found most effective were Supportant, Optimistic, and Confrontive. Coping styles used less and found least effective were Fatalistic, Evasive, and Emotive. The relationships between stressful life events and coping styles used during hospitalization demonstrated that not all subjects utilized multiple support systems along with problem solving behaviors to cope with the stress of hospitalization. Younger women reported more stressful life events and used different coping styles than the older women. Demographic variables of race, religion, education, and occupation also affected the use and effectiveness of coping styles. Results of this study support the idea that high risk multigravida women experience a variety of stressors and supports during antepartal hospitalization. The number of stressful life events varies along with the individual adaptive response to these stressors.

AB  - Objective: To assess the level of recognition and knowledge about treatment of depression by General Practitioners (GPs). Method: Analysis of questionnaires completed by participants commencing a series of workshops aimed at improving their knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of depression. Of the 3289 GPs involved in the program 2500 (76% respondent rate) completed the questionnaires in a group situation. There was no difference between respondents and nonrespondents in terms of age, gender and year of graduation. Results: The majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge and skills in counselling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms used to identify 'depression' were sleep disorders and only 54% listed depressed mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for DSM-IV major depressive disorder, which supports views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. Fifty-seven percent of doctors used medicine together with nonpharmacological treatment in the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range recommended in the product information. Conclusions: There is a need to improve GPs knowledge in diagnosing depression, in child psychiatry and in dealing with pregnant and suicidal patients.

TI  - The impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes for women during pregnancy and the postnatal period.
AU  - Jomeen J

T2  - Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice
AB  - RATIONALE: Psychological factors are acknowledged to impact on pregnancy, birth, neonatal outcomes and maternal mental health. The importance of psychological well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes. METHODS: 165 antenatal women were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14 days and 6 months postnatal. RESULTS: No significant differences between groups were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible, however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can affect psychological status.

TI  - The impact of gastroesophageal reflux in the growing premature infant on the mother-infant relationship.
AU  - Sables-Baus SM
AB  - Mothers may attribute infant behaviors of regurgitation, irritability or crying, or sleep disturbances to gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). There is a heightened risk for this attribution when an infant is born preterm. GER/GERD has been associated with maternal anxiety and depression that may negatively affect the maternal-infant relationship.The study was a secondary data analysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of maternal perception that her infant has symptoms of GER/GERD on maternal-infant interaction. The study also explored the influence of GER/GERD on maternal anxiety. A non-experimental comparative design was utilized with a convenience sample of 64 mothers and their healthy growing premature infants who were recruited at 32 weeks gestation. Review of home visit records as well as personal interviews revealed three attribution groupings: mother with no concerns and infant had no symptoms, mother attributed infant symptoms to GER/GERD but she was not concerned, and mother attributed infant symptoms to GER/GERD, was concerned, and sought medical attention. Child and maternal contingency scores were obtained with the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) when infants were 6 months of age. Anxiety was measured with the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI).MANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference in the mother-infant interaction among the 3 attribution groups, even when taking into account maternal anxiety and depression scores. There was not a statistically significant difference in maternal anxiety between groups.Results suggest that having an infant with behaviors attributed to GER/GERD does not negatively affect the mother infant relationship at 6 months. A limitation of this study was the small sample size and the lack of conformity of the three attribution groups in terms of demographic factors, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, that have been shown in other research to influence the mother-infant interaction.

AU  - Jomeen J
T2  - Clinical Effectiveness in Nursing
AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature surrounding women's psychological health in pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal periods. The content will provide clinically useful information to midwives and health care professionals involved in caring for women during the antenatal, intranatal and postnatal periods. The impact of psychological health status in pregnancy on clinical outcomes such as preterm labour, pre-eclampsia, epidural use, caesarean section, instrumental deliveries and increased rates of admission to neonatal intensive care, alongside the cognitive and social development of the infant and child are well documented. Less research to date has considered the impact of psychological well-being on the mother throughout pregnancy, the peripartum, postpartum and beyond. Psychological status for these women has traditionally been characterised by anxiety and depression, largely ignoring the complex psychological interrelations that characterise pregnancy. Psychological status in pregnancy cannot be defined within a unidimensional framework but must include a comprehensive assessment of all the dimensions that attribute to mood and emotional status for women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. This paper intends to address the constructs of anxiety and depression, worry, control, quality of life, sleep and self-esteem. Screening for, and identification of, maternal psychological distress from a multidimensional perspective enables healthcare professionals to recognise and acknowledge normal and abnormal adjustment and offer interventions, strategies and support to facilitate a woman's transition to motherhood.

AB  - Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is an important health issue that affects not only mothers, but also entire families, Postpartum follow-up should address emotional and psychological issues, as well as physical issues, especially in those at risk. This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at an urban maternity clinic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study investigating the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related, pregnancy-related, and child-related factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was 28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy, bottle-feeding only, mother's lack of satisfaction with the baby's sleep pattern, lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD. Conclusions: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly associated with PPD.

AU  - Beebe KR
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe selected biopsychosocial factors (sleep quality, self-efficacy for childbirth, and anxiety) in nulliparous women during the late third trimester and relate them to perception and performance (pain, fatigue, coping strategies, and time spent at home) in labor prior to hospitalization, as well as to eventual obstetric outcomes (cervical status on admission, oxytocin use, type of delivery, anesthesia use, and neonatal APGAR scores). This study was a descriptive, longitudinal, correlational study of the relationships among these variables.Participants were 35 English-speaking nulliparous women, ages 18 to 40, 38 weeks of completed gestation or greater, with uncomplicated pregnancies. In addition, all subjects were partnered and enrolled in childbirth education programs.At enrollment, Spielbergers Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to evaluate trait anxiety, while the Prenatal Self-Evaluation Questionnaire measured childbirth-specific anxiety. Self-efficacy for childbirth was measured with the Self-Efficacy for Childbirth Inventory. Antepartum sleep disturbance was measured over the last five nights of pregnancy using the wrist actigraph (MiniMotionlogger). Pain and fatigue in early labor at home were evaluated with the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form and the Visual Analogue Scale of Fatigue Severity. A combination of medical records review and postpartum audiotaped interviews provided information about the remaining pre-hospitalization and birth variables.Data analysis demonstrated significant relationships between: anxiety and self-efficacy for childbirth in late pregnancy (r = -.59, p < 0.01), total sleep time on the night before birth (TST-1) and pain in early labor (r = -.47, p < 0.05), numbers of cognitive coping strategies used and pain scores in early labor (r = -.47, p < 0.04), and the number of hours at home in labor and admitting cervical dilation (r =.70, p < 0.001). Subject-reported components of pre-hospitalization labor included: recognition of labor onset, management of signs, symptoms, and emotions of early labor, and decision to admit to the hospital. Women employed behavioral and cognitive strategies to manage these components. Sleep parameters of women approaching childbirth revealed a pattern of increasing sleep disturbance. TST-1 diminished significantly from TST-345 (t = 5.95, p < 0.001).

AB  - Background: In utero exposure to smoking is known to adversely affect brain regions involved in behavioral state organization and could therefore interact with the neurophysiological development of neonates.Study Objectives: The present study investigated the effects of prenatal smoking exposure on sleep patterns in the preterm neonate.Design: Overnight sleep patterns were polysomnographically assessed at thermoneutrality. Sleep continuity and structure were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset. The number and duration of body movements were also analyzed.Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France).Participants: Healthy preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 +/- 6.0 weeks) were enrolled according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy (control group, n = 19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, S[low], n = 10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, S[heavy], n = 10) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy.Measurements and Results: Neonates born to heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls (-21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls, neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result, more disturbed sleep.Conclusions: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.

AB  - Introduction Sleep is a physiological state of self-regulation. The international classification of sleep disorders now includes as a new category those occurring during pregnancy. Regular physical activity is known to improve the quality of life, one aspect of which is sleep quality. During pregnancy, physical activity is decreased but should not be eliminated, as studies have reported a high correlation between sleep disorders and the absence of physical activity. Regular physical exercise during pregnancy, whether performed in water or out of it, provides greater control of gestational weight gain. Furthermore, the reduced weight gain during pregnancy, as a result of physical exercise, is associated with greater physical resistance to the demands of childbirth, combats the fatigue caused by pregnancy and reduces back pain. All of these outcomes tend to enhance sleep quality, among other beneficial effects. Objective To determine whether, in pregnant women, there is an association between moderate-intensity physical activity in an aquatic environment and sleep quality. Material and methods A randomised clinical trial was conducted with a sample of 140 pregnant women aged 21–43 years, divided into two groups; Intervention Group and Control Group. The women were recruited in the twelfth week of gestation and took part in the [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy programme from week 20 to week 37. Sleep quality was evaluated in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Results The Mann–Whitney U test showed that the results obtained were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the Intervention Group, 44 of the women (65.67%) were classified as “poor sleepers” versus 62 women (92.54%) in the Control Group. Conclusions The [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy method improves the quality of sleep in pregnant women, both subjectively and in terms of latency, duration and efficiency.

T2  - British Journal of Health Psychology
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Post-partum weight retention (PWR) has been identified as a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. In recent years, psychological factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and maintaining PWR. DESIGN: Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between post-partum psychological distress and PWR at 9 months, after controlling for maternal weight factors, sleep quality, sociocontextual influences, and maternal behaviours. METHOD: Pregnant women (N = 126) completed a series of questionnaires at multiple time points from early pregnancy until 9 months post-partum. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression indicated that gestational weight gain, shorter duration (6 months or less) of breastfeeding, and post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months are associated with higher PWR at 9 months; stress, depression, and anxiety had minimal influence. CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should specifically target the prevention of body dissatisfaction and excessive weight gain during pregnancy. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Post-partum weight retention (PWR) is a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. Causes of PWR are complex and multifactorial. There is increasing evidence that psychological factors play a key role in predicting high PWR. What does this study add? Post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months is associated with PWR at 9 months post-birth. Post-partum depression, stress and anxiety have less influence on PWR at 9 months. Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should target body dissatisfaction.

AB  - Objective:The aim of this study was to examine whether depressive symptoms predict anxiety and stress or whether anxiety and stress precede depressive symptoms in fathers during the antenatal period.Background:The findings of previous studies suggest that there is an association between paternal depression, anxiety and stress during the antenatal period. However, the temporal inter-relationship between these variables has yet to be investigated.Method:Data were collected from 150 expectant couples at approximately 18, 25 and 33 weeks’ gestation.Results:After accounting for the relative stability of depression, anxiety and stress over time, for men higher levels of anxiety earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depression and stress in middle pregnancy, which predicted higher depression during late pregnancy. A similar relationship remained after partialling out the effects of partner’s depression, perceived social support and sleep quality. Further analyses also revealed significant differences in the manifestation of distress symptoms between men and women, but not between first-time and non-first-time fathers.Conclusion:Our findings indicated a possible inter-relationship between depression, anxiety and stress for men antenatally. Our findings also showed that men who reported elevated depression, anxiety and stress earlier in the antenatal period also reported elevated symptomology at later time points. Finally, the current findings revealed that antenatal paternal stress may play a key role in the development of depression and anxiety later in pregnancy. Therefore, it may be important to screen for early levels of antenatal stress in men, as well as depression and anxiety.

T2  - American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology
AB  - Objective Data: Sleep-disordered breathing is an increasingly common condition in nonobstetric populations and is associated with significant morbidity. The incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy is unknown, and it is likely that many cases go undiagnosed.Study: A systematic review and metaanalysis was undertaken to determine whether pregnant women who receive a diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing are more likely to have adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes compared with control subjects.Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl databases were searched for full-text publications in English of sleep-disordered breathing and human pregnancy up to June 2017. Only studies that reported on sleep-disordered breathing in relation to gestational age or birthweight at delivery, preterm birth, mode of delivery, cord pH, Apgar score, nursery admission, stillbirth or perinatal death, meconium at delivery, or wound complications were included.Results: A total of 1576 results were identified; 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Women with sleep-disordered breathing were older (mean difference, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.28) and had a higher body mass index (mean difference, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-4.32) than those who did not. Maternal sleep-disordered breathing was associated significantly with preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation; odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-2.31) and low birthweight (<2500 g; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.78). These women were also less likely to have a vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) and to be at a higher risk of having an assisted vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.21) or a cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.11). The risk of both elective (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 - 1.76) and emergency cesarean (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.29) was increased. In addition, women with sleep-disordered breathing were at a higher risk of having an infant with a 5-minute Apgar score <7 (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-3.71), stillbirth or perinatal death (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-3.28), and neonatal nursery admission (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-2.61).Conclusion: Maternal sleep-disordered breathing is associated with increased risks of adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes.

TI  - The late preterm infant and the control of breathing, sleep, and brainstem development: a review.
AU  - Darnall RA
AU  - Ariagno RL
AU  - Kinney HC
T2  - Clinics in Perinatology
AB  - The brainstem development of infants born between 33 and 38 weeks' gestation is less mature than that of a full-term infant. During late gestation, there are dramatic and nonlinear developmental changes in the brainstem. This translates into immaturity of upper airway and lung volume control, laryngeal reflexes, chemical control of breathing, and sleep mechanisms. Ten percent of late preterm infants have significant apnea of prematurity and they frequently have delays in establishing coordination of feeding and breathing. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of clinical, physiologic, neuroanatomic, and neurochemical data in this specific group of infants. Research focused on this group of infants will not only further our understanding of brainstem maturation during this high risk period, but will help develop focused plans for their management.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - To identify the concordance in assessments of health and social care needs of pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness as assessed by patients themselves and their mental healthcare professionals. Thirty-five staff-patient pairs were recruited from inpatient and community services. Staff and patients completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need-Mothers Version. There were significant differences in the total number of needs ( p < 0.01) and total number of unmet needs ( p < 0.001) reported by staff and patients themselves. There was moderate or better agreement on the presence of an unmet need in eight of 26 life domains. Agreement was low in several domains relevant to being a mother-notably pregnancy care, safety to child/others, and practical and emotional childcare domains. Unmet needs were particularly common in the areas of daytime activities, sleep, psychological distress and violence and abuse. Staff and pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness moderately agree about health and social care needs but agree less often on which needs are unmet. This highlights the importance of the views of the mothers themselves, as well as assessments by staff.

AU  - Dahlen, Hannah
T2  - Women & Birth
AB  - Background There appears to be a chasm between idealised motherhood and reality, and for women who experience birth trauma this can be more extreme and impact on mental health. Australia is unique in providing residential parenting services to support women with parenting needs such as sleep or feeding difficulties. Women who attend residential parenting services have experienced higher rates of intervention in birth and poor perinatal mental health but it is unknown how birth trauma may impact on early parenting. Aims and objectives This study aims to explore the early parenting experiences of women who have accessed residential parenting services in Australia and consider their birth was traumatic. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with eight women across Australia who had experienced birth trauma and accessed residential parenting services in the early parenting period. These interviews were conducted both face to face and over the telephone. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. Findings One overarching theme was identified: “The Perfect Storm of Trauma” which identified that the participants in this study who accessed residential parenting services were more likely to have entered pregnancy with pre-existing vulnerabilities, and experienced a culmination of traumatic events during labour, birth, and in the early parenting period. Four subthemes were identified: “Bringing Baggage to Birth”, “Trauma through a Thousand Cuts”, “Thrown into the Pressure Cooker”, and “Trying to work it all out”. Conclusion How women are cared for during their labour, birth and postnatal period impacts on how they manage early parenthood. Support is crucial for women, including practical parenting support, and emotional support by health professionals and peers.

AB  - Importance: Approximately 80% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently active. Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases.Objective: To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG).Process and Evidence Synthesis: The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report.Recommendations: The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial.Conclusions and Relevance: The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.

AU  - Mitchell A
AU  - Brooks S

T2  - Pain Management Nursing
AB  - Pain management for premature infants raises challenging questions for nurses. This group of infants is often physiologically fragile and they may undergo frequent painful procedures on a daily basis. Contrary to ideas from the past, premature infants are able to feel pain, and nervous system elements required for the transmission of painful stimuli are functional by 24 weeks gestation. Painful procedures are harmful to the infant's physiological stability and the ability to selfregulate, which includes maintenance of motor control and stable sleep/wake cycles. Assessment of pain in the premature infant is complex. Major indicators of pain include facial grimaces and physiological parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) is one tool designed specifically for preterm infants. Nonpharmacological nursing measures such as swaddling or nesting and offering a pacifier are useful strategies to help infants cope with painful procedures. The nurse may also maintain a therapeutic environment to assist the infant in self-regulation. Pharmacological agents such as morphine, fentanyl, and acetaminophen are effective in relieving procedural pain. The use of oral sucrose before and during painful procedures offers new possibilities for pain relief. Recent research shows that oral sucrose is a safe and effective analgesic for short-term procedures. Research studies to determine the most effective doses and modes of oral sucrose administration are ongoing. It is thought that the relief of pain is owing to the sweet taste of the sucrose that activates endogenous pain-modulating systems. (c) 2000 by the American Society of Pain Management Nurses

T2  - Journal of Hypertension
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine (a) the prevalence of hypertension during sleep in pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, and (b) whether women with hypertension during sleep have worse pregnancy outcomes than hypertensive pregnant women with controlled (normal) blood pressure (BP) during sleep. DESIGN: Prospective double-blind cohort study. SETTING: Inpatients and outpatients managed in a day assessment unit (DAU) at St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 186 hypertensive pregnant women, 158 of whom had successful 24 h BP monitoring; 40% had proteinuric pre-eclampsia (PE), 43% gestational hypertension (GH) and 17% essential hypertension (EH). INTERVENTIONS: Blood pressure, 24 h non-invasive, monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was undertaken successfully in 158 women with PE, GH or EH, whether or not they were receiving antihypertensives. Women and clinicians were blinded to results of these BP monitors. Sleep hypertension was defined as BP > 117/68 mmHg at 26-30 weeks or > 123/72 mmHg after 30 weeks gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between women with and without sleep hypertension and the prevalence of sleep hypertension was determined. RESULTS: Sleep hypertension was present in 59%, more commonly in PE (79%) than GH/EH (45%), P < 0.0001. Sleep hypertensives also had higher routine sphygmomanometer BPs [137(10)/91(7) mmHg; mean(SD)] than women with normal sleep BP [130(12)/ 87(8) mmHg] P = 0.007, and higher awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) BPs [137(8)/88(7) versus 127(7)/79(6) mmHg], P < 0.0001. Awake, but not sleep, average heart rate was lower in sleep hypertensives [85(11) versus 91 (10) beats per minute, bpm], P = 0.002. Sleep hypertensives had a significantly greater frequency of renal insufficiency, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and episodes of (awake) severe hypertension (P < 0.05), as well as lower birth weight babies [2715 (808) versus 3224(598) g, P < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension during sleep is a common finding in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia. These women also have higher awake BPs and a greater frequency of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. These findings are largely explained by the greater likelihood of pre-eclamptics having sleep hypertension.

AB  - Background: The main aim of this study was to examine the prospective impact of maternal postpartum PTSD on several standardized child sleep variables two years postpartum in a large, population-based cohort of mothers. Moreover, we investigated the influence of numerous potential confounding maternal and child factors. Finally, we tested potential reverse temporal associations between child sleep eight weeks postpartum and maternal PTSD symptoms two years postpartum.Methods: This study is part of the population-based Akershus Birth Cohort, a prospective cohort study at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Data from the hospital's birth record, from questionnaires at 17 weeks gestation, eight weeks and two years postpartum were used. At two years postpartum, 39% of the original participants could be retained, resulting in a study population of n = 1480. All child sleep variables significantly correlated with postpartum PTSD symptoms were entered into multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors.Results: Postpartum PTSD symptoms were related to all child sleep variables, except daytime sleep duration. When all significant confounding factors were included into multivariate regression analyses, postpartum PTSD symptoms remained a significant predictor for number and duration of night wakings (β = 0.10 and β = 0.08, respectively), duration of settling time (β = 0.10), and maternal rating of their child's sleep problems (β = 0.12, all p<.01. Child sleep at eight weeks postpartum was not significantly related to maternal sleep two years postpartum when controlling for postpartum PTSD at eight weeks.Limitations: Child outcomes were based on maternal reporting and might be influenced by maternal mental health.Conclusions: Our results showed for the first time that maternal postpartum PTSD symptoms were prospectively associated with less favorable child sleep, thus increasing the risk of developmental or behavioral problems through an indirect, but treatable pathway. Early detection and treatment of maternal postpartum PTSD may prevent or improve sleep problems and long-term child development.

AB  - By identifying a change in fetal activity state, fetal movement counting may help to reduce the possibility of stillbirth. Concern has arisen that such a focus on fetal activity may cause undue maternal anxiety. A prospective, controlled trial was conducted to determine whether fetal movement counting induced anxiety or other deleterious psychological effects in low-risk primigravidas. A sample of 613 healthy pregnant women was randomly assigned at 28 weeks' gestation to fetal movement counting, sleep recording, or a nonrecording control group. State and trait of anxiety, belief in sources of personal control, and attitudes toward pregnancy and infant were assessed at 28 and 37 weeks' gestation. Participation rates were high (91.4%) across all groups. Most women (90%) assigned to count fetal movements did so on a daily basis (95% of days). No significant changes in psychological status occurred in the three groups as a result of self-monitoring conditions. Independent of group assignment, all women showed a slight increase in transient state and decrease in trait of anxiety from 28 to 37 weeks. Internal locus of control and positive attitudes toward the infant increased slightly, and feelings of well-being decreased slightly for all women. It was concluded that women are willing to record fetal activity, and that fetal movement counting does not cause deleterious psychological effects in low-risk pregnant women.

TI  - The relation between maternal-fetal attachment and behavior in daily life of primigravid women.
AU  - Souma, Miki
T2  - Journal of Japan Academy of Midwifery
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine this relation between maternal-fetal attachment and behavior in daily life of primigravid women. Methods The participants of this study were 1,024 primigravid women in their third trimester that had already undergone an antenatal examination. Anonymous questionnaire were distributed to 40 hospitals and maternity centers in Hokkaido and returned by mail. Contents of the questionnaire consisted of information concerning fundamental attributes, pregnancy-related variables, Japanese translations of the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and questions about participants' behavior in daily life during pregnancy (such as meal habits, sleeping and exercise). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and nonparametric test. Results Of the 575 questionnaires collected, 440 were relevant to the analysis (valid response rate=43.0%). The average age of the subjects was 29, they were between 28 and 39 weeks gestation at the time. Issues that showed significant differences during the height fluctuations of maternal-fetal attachment concerned hopes and plans for the pregnancy, feelings of the pregnancy, images of the feelings and experiences subjects would have concerning the infant's care (ages 0-6 years), high self-esteem, meal habits during pregnancy, consciousness of consuming foods with higher iron content, sleeping during the day and exercise habits. Conclusion It is clinically useful to consider the behavior in daily life such as meal regularity, consciousness of consuming foods with higher iron content, allotting time to sleep during the day, and exercise as an objective index. These are issues that improve the maternal-fetal attachment. Research findings to date indicate that the consciousness of the primigravid women which values fetal well-being and growth serves as intrinsic motivation of the behavior in daily life of health.

TI  - The relationship among selected variables associated with fatigue in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AU  - Knippen MA
AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disease, characterized by exacerbations and remissions which predominantly affects women of childbearing age. Today there are an estimated one million people in the United States diagnosed with SLE, 85% of whom are women. Moderate to severe fatigue has been recognized as a major problem in 80% of cases both at the time of diagnosis and during the course of disease (Rothfield, 1985). Because of the dearth of information available in the literature which described the nature of fatigue in illness, the purpose of this study was to describe the relationship of fatigue with disease activity, depression, and sleep in women with SLE. Data were collected on 70 female subjects, diagnosed with SLE between the ages of 20 and 45 years. Each subject completed instruments designed to measure fatigue, depression, sleep, and the perception of disease activity. In addition, each subject was interviewed about disease activity and asked to briefly describe how fatigue had impacted on her life and ways she found effective to manage it. The findings revealed moderate but statistically significant correlations between fatigue with depression, disease activity, steroid dose, and perception of disease activity. Depressive symptomatology was present in 74% of the sample. Results of multiple regression analysis revealed that the most important predictor of fatigue was the patient's perception of her disease activity. Findings from this study described the presence and problematic nature of fatigue in SLE. It reinforced the need for nurses to carefully assess the presence of depression in chronic illness and to provide patients with realistic assessments of their situation and effective, realistic strategies to cope with them.

AU  - Izci-Balserak, Bilgay
AU  - Pien, Grace W
T2  - Current Diabetes Reports
AB  - This paper reviews recent work investigating the influence of sleep disturbances on maternal hyperglycemia, particularly gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The incidence and prevalence of hyperglycemia are increasing worldwide, which is cause for concern because GDM and even mild hyperglycemia are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A better understanding of sleep-related risk factors for maternal hyperglycemia is an important health matter. Evidence demonstrates associations between sleep disturbances, especially sleep-disordered breathing, and hyperglycemia, but causal effects and the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions have not been fully elucidated. Subjective sleep assessments show associations between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There are, however, few studies using objective measures to support these findings. Large prospective studies are required to examine causal relationships between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There is also a need for smaller mechanistic studies to understand the pathophysiology. Furthermore, interventional studies are required to address whether improvement of sleep parameters can prevent/decrease the risk of developing maternal hyperglycemia. Taken together, the data suggests that sleep disturbances during pregnancy are important to identify and manage in order to minimize maternal hyperglycemia and GDM, and improve maternal and fetal well-being.

T2  - Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)
AB  - Objective. We report on the distribution of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution in the first trimester and on the association between TCM constitution and maternal symptoms related to pregnancy. Methods. Participants were followed up until delivery to observe primary measures (gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus) and secondary measures (signs of miscarriage, miscarriage, nausea and vomiting, and sleepiness and defecation during pregnancy). Descriptive analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis were used in this study. Results. 61.8% of the participants had unbalanced constitutions. We did not find a significant association between the TCM constitution and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, signs of miscarriage, and defecation during pregnancy. And we found that women with unbalanced constitutions in early pregnancy had a greater likelihood of severe nausea and vomiting and poor sleep during pregnancy in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions. These results have implications for female health care providers and policy makers. Identification of TCM constitution may be helpful for understanding nausea and vomiting and poor sleepiness during pregnancy, especially in the condition that can not be explained by modern medical science, and be helpful for making program to improve these uncomfortable symptoms.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze relationships among general health, coping style, and perceived stress in healthy primigravida pregnant women. A cross-sectional study was conducted at public health clinics in Hamadan city, Iran between July and December 2015. In total, 380 pregnant women were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory and General Health Questionnaire. Perceived stress was assessed through an interview comprised of open-ended questions. The final PATH model fit well; general health (β = 0.02) as well as anxiety and sleep disorders (β = 0.03) were slightly directly associated with perceived stress, and only planning-preparation was related to perceived stress through general health (β = 0.09). The findings enhance the knowledge gained from previous perinatal stress research. General health status was directly related to stress, and coping style was indirectly related to stress. Coping styles may mediate the relationship between general health status and perceived stress, suggesting that midwives should attempt to improve the general health of women to reduce stress and its consequences during pregnancy by teaching patients appropriate coping styles. Further studies on the effect of coping style interventions on stress are warranted.

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: Postpartum mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis) are serious conditions that affect approximately 10-15% of women after childbirth, and up to 40% of women at risk for these disorders. Research reveals an association between poor sleep quality/quantity and symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosis. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence for the relationship between sleep and postpartum mental disorders.Methods: Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost CINAHL through June 30, 2014. Manual searching was performed on reference lists of included articles. Published primary research in any language was included.Results: There were 3187 unique titles/abstracts and 44 full-text articles reviewed. Thirty-one studies were included. Evidence was found for the impact of self-reported poor sleep during pregnancy and the postpartum on the development of postpartum depression, with not enough evidence for either postpartum anxiety or psychosis. The evidence for objectively assessed sleep and the development of postpartum disorders was mixed. Among the 31 studies included, 1 was strong, 13 were moderate and 17 were weak.Limitations: Research design, method of assessment, timing of assessment, recruitment strategies, representative adequacy of the samples and inclusion/exclusion criteria all varied widely. Many studies did not use tools validated for the perinatal population and had small sample sizes without power analysis.Conclusions: Sleep interventions represent a potential low-cost, non-pharmacological prevention and treatment strategy for postpartum mental illness. Further high-quality research is needed on this topic area.

TI  - The relationship of fetal activity patterns to newborn wake-sleep cycles.
AU  - Leake PY
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between fetal activity and wake and sleep cycles in the newborn. Four behavioral states were documented in the 36-38 week fetus that closely paralleled the six behavioral states of waking and sleeping in the neonate. The comparison of these states during late gestation and the early newborn period was the focus of the study. A time series, multiple case study approach was used to examine the relationship between fetal and newborn activity patterns. Eighteen subjects recorded fetal activity during the last month of pregnancy, and continued recording the newborn's activity during the first two weeks after birth. The NCAST Sleep/Activity Record, developed by Dr. Kathryn Barnard as part of the Nursing Child Assessment Project (1978) was used to record newborn activity. A researcher-modified version of the NCASA was used to record fetal activity. Daily Appointment Schedules were used to record maternal activity during the prenatal period. Interviews were conducted with each family to obtain demographic, lifestyle, and delivery information. Analysis of the data was completed on an individual case basis using a time series method called pattern matching. Graphs representing the patterns of fetal activity and newborn activity were matched to identify similarities and differences. Striking similarities were identified in fifteen of the eighteen subjects. Fifteen of the eighteen subjects had significant Pearson correlations at least at the p < .05 level when comparing fetal and newborn patterns of activity. Correlations with maternal activity were questionable or non-significant. This study supported the concept that fetal activity emerges as definable patterns of quiet and active periods during the last month of pregnancy. Regardless of maternal activity and the birth process, the patterns of fetal activity continued into the first few weeks of the newborn's life. Nursing implications. Pregnant women should be encouraged to monitor fetal activity during the last month of pregnancy in order to identify patterns of fetal and potentially newborn activity. Identification of rhythmicity in the newborn could enhance the adaptive behaviors of the mother and her family when the newborn baby comes into the home.

AB  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a burdensome sleep disorder, has been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and related disorders. However, the relationship of RLS to history of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), a predictor of subsequent CVD, diabetes, and associated conditions, remains little explored. In this study, we investigated the relationship of RLS to history of PIH in a sample of primary care patients. Methods: Participants were women aged ≥40 years drawn from an anonymous survey study of West Virginia primary care patients. Data collected included detailed information on demographics, lifestyle factors, sleep patterns, and reproductive/medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic questionnaire. Women who were pregnant or unsure about their pregnancy status were excluded from the analyses. Results: Of the 498 participants in the final analytic sample, 24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms ≥once/week, 11.9% with symptoms ≥3 times/week); 73 (16.5% of parous women) reported a history of PIH, defined as physician-diagnosed preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle characteristics, obesity, reproductive history, health conditions, and other factors, those reporting a history of PIH were approximately twice as likely to meet criteria for RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 3.6). These associations increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (adjusted OR for RLS with symptoms ≥3 times/week = 3.8; CI 1.9, 7.6; p for trend = 0.003). Conclusions: History of PIH was strongly and positively related to current RLS in this study of primary care patients; these findings further support a possible role for metabolic dysregulation in RLS etiology.

AU  - Moon C
T2  - Clinics in Perinatology
AB  - Auditory perception and learning take place during the third trimester of gestation. Fetuses and newborns who lack typical auditory experience can go on to develop typical socioemotional attachment and language, given a supportive environment. For hospitalized preterm infants in developmentally sensitive neonatal intensive care units, detrimental effects of deviant early auditory experience may be remediated by later experience, but much is unknown about the causes of language deficits of prematurity. Prenatal auditory stimulation programs that incorporate audio speakers against the maternal belly should be discouraged because of possible overstimulation effects on the developing auditory system and sleep/wake state organization.

Mechanisms underlying the association between obstructive sleep apnea and gestational diabetes remain to be elucidated. Methods Twenty-three participants with gestational diabetes underwent home sleep apnea testing. Obstructive sleep apnea was defined as an apnea hypopnea index > 5. Fasting morning blood samples were measured using multianalyte profiling (xMAP) multiplexed bead array immunoassay for Interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and Interleukin 8. Results Age, body mass index, and gestational age at enrollment were 31 + 4.4 years, 35.7 + 7.4 kg/m2, and 28 ± 4 weeks, respectively. Participants were 52% Caucasian and 16% had obstructive sleep apnea. We observed positive correlations between apnea hypopnea index and Interleukin 6 (r = 0.62, p = 0.005), Interleukin 8 (r = 0.56, p = .56), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r = .58, p = .009). Women with obstructive sleep apnea had higher levels of Interleukin 6 (F = 5.01, p = .037) and Interleukin 8 (F = 6.33, p = .021) vs. women without obstructive sleep apnea. Conclusion These preliminary results indicate that in women with gestational diabetes, apnea hypopnea index is associated with an elevated inflammatory profile.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this paper was to examine the role of perinatal, obstetric and post partum factors on maternal and paternal stress. It will present the first examination of the role of prenatal, obstetric, post-partum, and demographic variables in parenting stress for mothers and fathers at 9 months.Methods: Data from 6821 parental dyads of 9-month-old infants were extracted from the Growing Up in Ireland National Longitudinal Study of Children. Participants completed the Parental Stress Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Quality of Attachment Sub-scale from the Maternal and Paternal Postnatal Attachment Scales, and a single item health status question from the Short Form 12 Health Survey. Information on prenatal care, pregnancy complications, obstetric outcomes, infant health, and participant demographics were also collected. Separate hierarchical linear regressions were conducted for mothers and fathers Results: Mothers reported higher levels of parenting stress than fathers (p < 0.001). Maternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment, own health status, average sleep, occupation, household income, and having a very rapid labor. Paternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment and own health status.Discussion: A range of perinatal factors was associated with an increased risk of higher parenting stress at 9 months post-partum and the roles of these factors differ between mothers and fathers. These findings are important for predicting and reducing risk of parenting stress in both genders.

AB  - Newer generation antidepressant drugs (ADs) are widely used as the first line of treatment for major depressive disorders and are considered to be safer than tricyclic agents. In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation, but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia), hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes, risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus, the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks, likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to consider alternative treatments if available.

AB  - Introduction: Women commonly use massage therapy during pregnancy for pregnancy-related health conditions such as lower back and neck pain; however, there is little to no research related evidence on the side effects or mother or child physical harm of massage during pregnancy and the postnatal period.Objectives: This study aims to report on the side effects and mother or child physical harm of massage during pregnancy and the postnatal period.Design: An observational study methodology.Setting and Time Frame: Two massage clinics, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne recruited participants from December 2016 to December 2017.Intervention: Massage.Main Outcome Measure: Side effects and mother or child physical harm from massage.Results: One hundred and one participants were recruited to the study. Two fifths of the participants (n = 32, 40%) experienced one of more post-massage side effects. There were no mother or child physical harm events. Low back pain was the most common condition women sought massage treatment for 34 (33.7.%). A significant benefit (p < 0.001) was seen pre-massage to post-massage and pre-massage to 1-week post massage in decreasing stress, decreasing pain, increasing range of motion and improving sleep DISCUSSION: Similar to previous research, low back pain was the most common condition that women sought massage treatment for followed by hip pain, shoulder pain, neck pain and to improve mental health. Ninety-seven percent of the cohort received a full body massage including the feet leading credence that 'massage on the feet during pregnancy is harmful' is mythic in nature.Conclusion: While our findings lead credence that massage on the feet during pregnancy is a myth the study was not powered to determine the safety of pregnancy massage and further research is needed. Massage was commonly sought for low back pain with promising benefits in decreased pain and improved range of movement and further research on the effectiveness of massage for low back pain in pregnancy.

T2  - Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology
AB  - Postpartum women sleep less during the early days following delivery. Long-term sleep disturbance and fatigue can have significant implications for physical and mental health, relationships, employment and parental competence. Most studies focus on the quality and quantity of maternal sleep between weeks one and six postpartum. We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery. Thirty first-time mothers completed a postnatal sleep questionnaire, detailing their total sleep time (TST), the reasons for being awake and their level of fatigue. The logs were completed in real time during the first 48 h postpartum, while they were still in a hospital environment. The data collected from the mothers in the study indicated that the mean TST in the first 48 h was 9.7 h. Of the factors explored only breastfeeding influenced the TST. Breastfeeding women slept on average 2.6 h longer than women who bottle-fed (p = .042). Impact statement What is already known on this subject: Childbearing affects women's sleep in many ways. Hormonal changes during pregnancy and postpartum as well as physiological and anatomical alterations, and the process of adaptation to the new parent's responsibilities contribute to changes in sleep architecture. Since first study of sleep and pregnancy published in 1968 there have been very few publications addressing maternal sleep postpartum. Most studies which have focussed on quality of maternal sleep in the first 6-months postpartum period describe the relationships between poor maternal sleep and postpartum depression and other mental health outcomes. What the results of this study add: We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery while they remained in the hospital environment. We found that environmental factors such as background noise, shared rooms, type of delivery, feeding and worrying about the neonate did not influence the total sleep time, however, the main outcome of our study is that breastfeeding promotes maternal sleep. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: We believe that this study would be of interest to many obstetricians, general practitioners, nurses and midwives as well as to the general public. Appropriate counselling of patients early in postnatal period can improve their sleep patterns and reduce the risk of depression and other abnormal physical, psychological and social outcomes.

AB  - Background: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life. Breastfed babies grow more slowly during infancy than formula-fed babies. Among offspring exposed in utero to maternal glucose intolerance, prospective data on growth during infancy have been unavailable. Thus, scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that breastfeeding reduces the risk of obesity among the offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM). To address this gap, we devised the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM Pregnancy and Growth of their Offspring, also known as the SWIFT Offspring Study. This prospective, longitudinal study recruited mother-infant pairs from the SWIFT Study, a prospective study of women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The goal of the SWIFT Offspring Study is to determine whether breastfeeding intensity and duration, compared with formula feeding, are related to slower growth of GDM offspring during the first year life. This article details the study design, participant eligibility, data collection, and methodologies. We also describe the baseline characteristics of the GDM mother-infant pairs.Methods: The study enrolled 466 mother-infant pairs among GDM deliveries in northern California from 2009-2011. Participants attended three in-person study exams at 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after delivery for infant anthropometry (head circumference, body weight, length, abdominal circumference and skinfold thicknesses), as well as maternal anthropometry (body weight, waist circumference and percent body fat). Mothers also completed questionnaires on health and lifestyle behaviors, including infant diet, sleep and temperament. Breastfeeding intensity and duration were assessed via several sources (diaries, telephone interviews, monthly mailings and in-person exams) from birth through the first year of life. Pregnancy course, clinical perinatal and newborn outcomes were obtained from health plan electronic medical records. Infant saliva samples were collected and stored for genetics studies.Discussion: This large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of GDM offspring will enable evaluation of the relationship of infant feeding to growth during infancy independent of perinatal characteristics, sociodemographics and other risk factors. The longitudinal design provides the first quantitative measures of breastfeeding intensity and duration among GDM offspring during early life.

TI  - The synchronization of rhythmicity in first-time mothers and their family members.
AU  - Yamazaki A
AB  - Prior research on sleep-wake patterns during transition to parenthood has focused on the mothers, or mother-baby dyads. However, little is known about fathers and their transition to parenthood. This study focused on the 24-hour rhythms of 101 Japanese couples at 32-36 weeks gestation and 4-5 weeks after birth.Repeated measures analysis of variance and time series methods were used to test for postpartum changes in sleep and rhythm for mothers and fathers having their first child. The strength of the sleep-wake rhythm over a 7-day period significantly decreased over time and was not different by gender. Chronotype shifted significantly from morning type toward more evening type; mothers were more morning chronotype than fathers at both time points. Mothers became less consistent in their social rhythms, whereas fathers became more consistent in their rhythms.After sleeping arrangement was controlled, changes in wake-sleep rhythm strength and chronotype did not appear. The interaction of gender and sleeping arrangement had a statistically significant effect on wake-sleep rhythm strength. If the father's sleep-wake rhythm strength was higher than mother at third trimester, the couple was more likely to sleep together with baby after birth; if his rhythm strength was lower than mother's, only the mother slept with baby, and the father slept elsewhere.Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine how much variance in mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks after birth could be explained by family synchronizers as predictor variables after other mother-related variables were controlled. As a result, 25% of the variance in mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks after birth was explained by three predictor variables: income, mother's chronotype at third trimester, and consistency of father's postpartum social rhythm. The results from this study challenge health care providers to focus on how they can help childbearing couples who are experiencing irregular daily patterns. Future research should be aimed at how the mother's rhythm strength and father's daily social rhythm affects maternal-infant attachment and coping with her new maternal role.

AB  - Background: Perimenopause is associated with increased depression symptoms in women. Symptoms at this time are thought to be qualitatively different from those in childbearing years, and to present with milder symptoms of depression, increased agitation, and fatigue. This research aimed to determine whether depressive symptoms during perimenopause can be distinguished from those in the childbearing years. Methods: Seventy-four depressed women who were either perimenopausal (n = 40) or in their childbearing years (n = 34) were recruited (M = 40.11; SD = 11 years). Participants completed a series of questionnaires relating to depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), various mood states (Profile of Mood States), and changes in sleep patterns. Results: Univariate relationships between symptoms and perimenopausal status were assessed. All significant variables (anger-hostility, depression, tension-anxiety, fatigue-inertia, and changes in sleep quality) were analysed via logistic regression. Mood profile at these two different life stages were differentiated based on lower levels of depression symptoms and tensionanxiety, and increased levels of anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and sleep disturbance in the perimenopausal women as compared with the childbearing group. Conclusions: This research supports the unique presentation of perimenopausal depression. The identification of a unique symptomatic profile provides targets for intervention and allows for different treatment options.

AB  - Snoring is common in pregnancy, and snoring pregnant women have increased rates of pre-eclampsia. Patients with pre-eclampsia show upper airway narrowing during sleep. The present study aimed to compare upper airway dimensions in pregnant and nonpregnant women and in patients with pre-eclampsia. A total of 50 women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 37 women with pre-eclampsia were recruited consecutively from the antenatal service and matched with 50 nonpregnant women. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Snoring was reported by 14% of nonpregnant women, 28% of pregnant women, and 75% of pre-eclamptic women (p < 0.001). When seated, pregnant women had wider upper airways than nonpregnant women (p < 0.02), but there was no difference when supine. Oropharyngeal junction area in the seated position was less (p < 0.01) in the women with pre-eclampsia (mean +/- SD: 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2) than either nonpregnant (1.1 +/- 0.1 cm2) or pregnant women (1.3 +/- 0.1 cm2). Supine oropharyngeal junction area was less in the women with pre-eclampsia than in the nonpregnant women (0.8 +/- 0.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.1 cm2; p = 0.01) but similar in women with pre-eclampsia and pregnant women (0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2; p > 0.3). The study showed that women with pre-eclampsia have upper airway narrowing in both upright and supine postures. These changes could contribute to the upper airway resistance episodes during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may further increase their blood pressure.

AB  - Objective: To quantify the quality of life (QoL) and visit-specific satisfaction of pregnant women. Design: A prospective cohort within a practice-based research network (PBRN). Setting/Locations: Individual chiropractic offices. Subjects: Pregnant women (age ≥18 years) attending chiropractic care. Intervention(s): Chiropractic care (i.e., The Webster Technique, spinal adjustments, and adjunctive therapies). Main outcome measures: The RAND VSQ9 to measure visit-specific satisfaction and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®)-29 to measure QoL. Results: A convenience sample of 343 pregnant patients (average age = 30.96 years) comprised their study population. They were highly educated with 75% attaining a 2-year associate's degree or higher. The pregnant patients presented for chiropractic care with a mean week of gestation of 25.67 weeks (median = 28 weeks; range = 0-42 weeks) and parity (i.e., the number of live births) of 0.92 live births (median = 1; range = 0-6). From baseline (i.e., at study entrance with minimum first visit) and comparative (i.e., following a course of chiropractic care), the VSQ9 measurements revealed increasingly high satisfaction on the part of the subjects (i.e., the mean difference of baseline minus comparative measures = −0.7322; p < 0.005). The median number of visits (i.e., visits attended) at baseline and comparative measures was 1.00 (standard deviation [SD] = 22.69) and 3.30 (SD = 22.71), respectively. Across outcomes, QoL improved from baseline to comparative measurement after holding constant for visit number and time lapse, trimester of pregnancy, and care provider type. There was a reduction in mean T scores associated with fatigue ( p < 0.05), pain interference ( p < 0.05), sleep disturbance ( p < 0.05), and an improvement in satisfaction with social roles ( p < 0.05). A significant decrease was also found with pain interference ( p < 0.05). No evidence was found that anxiety ( p = 0.1404) or depression ( p = 0.8785) changed. Conclusion: A PBRN study was successfully implemented among chiropractors to find pregnant patients highly satisfied and their QoL scores improving with care beyond chance.

AB  - Men appear to gain weight during the transition to parenthood, and fathers are heavier than non-fathers. Paternal perinatal weight gain may set weight trajectories in midlife and have long-term health implications. Since men do not undergo the physical demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding, the specific mechanisms underlying weight gain in new fathers warrant investigation. This review aims to stimulate research on paternal perinatal weight gain by suggesting testable potential mechanisms that (1) show change across the transition to parenthood and (2) play a role in weight and body composition. We identify seven mechanisms, within three categories: behavioural mechanisms (sleep, physical activity, and diet), hormonal mechanisms (testosterone and cortisol), and psychological mechanisms (depression and stress). We also discuss direct effects of partner pregnancy influences (e.g., ‘couvade syndrome’) on men’s body weight. In presenting each mechanism, we discuss how it may be affected by the transition to parenthood, and then review its role in body composition and weight. Next, we describe bidirectional and interactive effects, discuss timing, and present three broad research questions to propel theoretical development.

AB  - Background: Repetitive episodes of hypoxia and reoxygenation during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) resemble an ischemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress occurs in pregnant women with OSAS. We also aimed to compare thiol/disulfide homeostasis with ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers of ischemia-reperfusion injury in pregnant women with and without OSAS and healthy control.Methods: This study included 29 pregnant women with OSAS, 30 women without OSAS in the third trimester applying for periodic examinations, and 30 healthy women. Serum IMA and TAC (using the ferric reducing power of plasma method) were measured. Serum thiol/disulfide homeostasis was determined by a novel automated method.Results: The mean age of the pregnant women with OSAS was 31.0 ± 4.7 years with a mean gestational age of 36.5 ± 3.0 weeks. The mean age of pregnant women without OSAS was 29.8 ± 4.9 years with a mean gestational age of 36.9 ± 2.7 weeks. The mean age of the nonpregnant control group was 29.7 ± 6.4 years. Both native thiol (291 ± 29 μmol/L versus 314 ± 30 μmol/L; p = .018) and total thiol (325 ± 32 versus 350 ± 32, p = .025) levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to pregnant women without OSAS, respectively (p < .01).Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating the thiol/disulfide homeostasis in pregnant women with OSAS. Native thiol and total thiol levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to those without OSAS. However, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis parameters cannot provide valuable information to discriminate OSAS in pregnant women.

AB  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at <28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200-600 lux and night was 5-30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9,18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36-44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives To identify and characterize the trajectories of depressive and fatigue symptoms and determine the relationship between these two trajectories and associated predictors. Design A prospective, follow-up study. Setting A teaching medical center in central Taiwan. Participants A convenience sample of 121 low-risk, childbearing women. Methods Depressive and fatigue symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Fatigue Continuum Form respectively during the third trimester (time 1), one day postpartum (time 2), three days postpartum (time 3), and one week postpartum (time 4). Participants also completed structured questionnaires on demographic features, health status, and sleep quality. Results The mean age of participants was 31.2 years. We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Conclusion Overlapping but distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and fatigue were found. These results suggest that differentiation between depressive symptoms and fatigue is possible and important for improving care during the early postpartum period.

AB  - Background: Sleep problems are common during pregnancy and in the postnatal period, but there is still a lack of longitudinal population-based studies assessing the quantity and quality of sleep in these women. The aim of the current study was to examine the natural development and stability of insomnia and short sleep duration in women from pregnancy to two years postpartum.Methods: This was a longitudinal cohort study (the Akershus Birth Cohort Study) of 1480 healthy women, who completed three comprehensive health surveys, at week 32 of pregnancy, week 8 postpartum and year 2 postpartum. The survey was composed of the following validated questionnaires: the Bergen Insomnia Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Differences in sleep characteristics between the three assessment points were compared using Analyses of Variance with repeated measures, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the stability of sleep variables.Results: One thousand four hundred and eighty women completed all three surveys, and the mean age at birth was 30.7 (+/-4.9). The prevalence of insomnia remained stable at 60 % at the first two time periods, and remained high at 41 % at year 2 postpartum. The mean sleep duration at the three time periods was 7 h 16 min, 6 h 31 min, and 6 h 52 min, respectively. Concurrent maternal depression could not explain the stability of sleep problems from during and immediately after pregnancy, to sleep problems 2 years postpartum.Conclusion: Both insomnia and short sleep duration were found to be very common both before and after pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: To describe trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents and to identify early indicators of these trajectories using data from routine well-child assessments at ages 0–4 years. Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11–17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0–4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories. Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43). Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate trajectories of sleep quality and associations with mood in the perinatal period. Although it is commonly accepted that subjective sleep quality declines during pregnancy and the transition to parenthood, some women may follow qualitatively distinct trajectories.Design, Setting, and Participants: Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected from 293 women at four time points: during early pregnancy, at Time 1 (T1; < 22 w gestational age [GA]; late pregnancy, at Time 2 (T2; 32 w GA); during the postnatal period at Time 3 (T3; 3 mo postpartum); and Time 4 (T4; 6 mo postpartum). A group-based semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate patterns of sleep quality throughout the perinatal period.Results: Four trajectory groups were identified, including patterns defined by high sleep quality throughout (21.5%), mild decrease in sleep quality (59.5%), significant decrease in sleep quality (12.3%) and a group with poor sleep quality throughout (6.7%). Women who had the worst sleep quality at Time 1 and those who experienced significant increases in sleep problems throughout pregnancy were also the groups who reported the highest levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and the lowest levels of social support. After controlling for covariates, the groups with worst subjective sleep quality during pregnancy were also the most likely to experience high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.Conclusions: Most of the women in our sample reported mild sleep disturbances through the perinatal period. A subgroup of women reported a significant decline in sleep quality from early to late pregnancy and another reported poor subjective sleep quality throughout pregnancy; these groups had the greatest risk of experiencing high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.

AB  - Knowledge translation has relied on research products that take years to disseminate, losing relevance for intended users. We used a mixed-methods approach to determine women's preferences for research results and format, intention to share results, and potential benefits. We sampled healthy, pregnant women who completed survey data during their third trimesters and wanted access to results. Mothers preferred results about sleep, fears, and anxieties during later pregnancy to benefit from reassurance that their experiences were shared. Women mostly intended to share results with their social networks. Organizational contacts increased dissemination of the women's preferred information to nonstudy participants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin. METHODS: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. RESULTS: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance. CONCLUSION: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Preeclampsia affects 5% to 7% of pregnancies, is strongly associated with low birth weight and fetal death, and is accompanied by sleep disordered breathing. We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: First, a method of fetal movement recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and during a night of nasal CPAP. INTERVENTION: Overnight continuous positive airway pressure. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

AB  - Breastfeeding benefits both infant and mother, including reducing the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). To further reduce risk of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants sleep on their backs on a separate sleep surface. Our objective was to describe trends and factors associated with breastfeeding and infant sleep practices in Georgia. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 2004-2013 data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Chi square tests for trends were utilized to determine whether there were significant linear trends in breastfeeding and infant sleep overtime and by survey phase. After exclusions, 4643 cases remained for analysis. From 2004 to 2013, there was a slight (insignificant) decrease in breastfeeding initiation, with the highest proportion in 2010 (79.9%) and the lowest in 2013 (66.9%). Rates of exclusive breastfeeding increased significantly from 2004 (31.3%) to 2013 (81.7%). During that time, the proportion of infants being placed back to sleep slightly decreased (though not significantly), from 59.7 to 48.9%. The proportion of mothers who reported never bed-sharing increased significantly from 26.7 to 45.1% over this period. The decreasing breastfeeding initiation rates in Georgia diverge from national upward trends, however, exclusive breastfeeding rates by survey phase were slightly higher than national trends. Our results suggest the need for targeted education and support for breastfeeding and safe sleep practices. State-level trends data on breastfeeding and infant sleep practices provide valuable information for state-level public health professionals and policy makers, health care providers, and breastfeeding and safe sleep advocates.

AB  - Background: Our goal is to study the triggers of spontaneous preterm delivery using a case-crossover design.Methods: In a pilot study, we enrolled 50 women with spontaneous preterm labour (PTL) and 50 with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) between 2011 and 2012. To assess non-transient risk factors, we also enrolled a control group of 158 pregnant women at their regular prenatal care visits matched to cases by gestational age and calendar time. The index time was defined as the onset of PTL/PPROM (for cases) or interview (for controls). Detailed data were collected through structured interviews regarding factors of interest during the 72 h that preceded the index time. Within case subjects, we compared the frequency of transient factors from 0 to 24 h before index time with that from 48 to 72 h before index time, and estimated matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results: Previously hypothesised chronic risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery, including mood disorders and stressful events, were more common among cases than among controls. Within cases, skipped meals [OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2, 15.2], disturbed sleep [OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5, 13.3], sexual activity [OR 6.0, 95% CI 0.7, 69.8], and intake of spicy foods [OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.6, 30.8] were associated with an increased risk for PTL/PPROM within the subsequent 24 h. For physical exertion and other potential risk factors evaluated, the OR was close to the null.Conclusion: Skipping meals and disturbed sleep may be associated with imminent PTL/PPROM; sexual activity and spicy food may trigger PTL/PPROM in susceptible women. Larger case-crossover studies will be able to evaluate the impact of modifiable risk factors and acute predictors of PTL/PPROM, and might help guide obstetrical management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy and motherhood are important in women’s lives, but they can generate physical and emotional changes making them vulnerable. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the presence of maternal sadness symptoms experienced by postpartum women and their associated factors. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, quantitative study of 278 women admitted to a Maternity Hospital in the Northwest of Paraná, Southern Brazil, between January and June 2015. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EPDS) and The Brazilian Humor Scale (BRAMS) for data collection. RESULTS: Scores ≥11 in the EPDS were statistically associated with low economic status, multiparity, unplanned pregnancy, history of depression and sleep disturbance. Regarding BRAMS, women with per capita income above R$ 300.00 reais showed feelings of vigor; however, feelings of anger, depression and fatigue were shown to be associated with multiparity, unplanned pregnancy, history of depression and sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: The high percentage of women who presented depressive symptoms justifies the importance and need of care for women’s mental health in the gestational and puerperal periods, since they are periods of vulnerability and transformation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive ability of parameters of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension in women who are already considered at risk for these disorders. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty-two pregnant women who were considered high risk for the development of preeclampsia underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring between 18 and 30 weeks gestation, while their condition was normotensive according to routine mercury sphygmomanometry. One hundred sixty-four healthy primigravid women who were considered at usual risk for preeclampsia underwent the same tests as a parallel study. Routine blood pressure, awake and sleep average blood pressure, and 24-hour mean average blood pressure were entered into multiple logistic regression as predictors of either preeclampsia or gestational hypertension; significant variables were then tested by a series of receiver operator curves. RESULTS: Eight percent of usual risk and 45% of high risk women experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In both groups, the average routine mercury blood pressure and awake, sleeping, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived blood pressure were significantly higher in women who later experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In usual risk women, 24-hour systolic blood pressure of >or=115 mm Hg and sleeping systolic blood pressure of >or=106 mm Hg were predictive of later preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but sensitivities were low (77% and 54%, respectively). In high risk women, sleeping diastolic blood pressure of >or=62 mm Hg and sleeping mean arterial pressure of >or=79 mm Hg were predictive of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but again sensitivities were low (70% and 65%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Awake and sleeping blood pressure are higher in midpregnancy in women who later experience the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a noninvasive method of selecting some of these women, but this test has a sensitivity no better than that of other predictive tests, even in women at high risk for preeclampsia.

AB  - Objective: Maternal supine posture in late pregnancy and labor is known to compromise maternal hemodynamics and subsequently affect the fetus. Recently, maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position.Methods: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home sleep studies.Results: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age 28.3±6.9weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0-82.9%).Conclusion: Our data suggest that if supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education regarding sleep position.Practice Implications: Most pregnant women spend time asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: Sleep during pregnancy involves a physiological challenge to provide sufficient gas exchange to the fetus. Enhanced ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia may protect from deficient gas exchange, but sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may predispose to adverse events. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep and breathing in healthy pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls, with a focus on CO2 changes and upper-airway flow limitation.Methods: Healthy women in the third trimester and healthy non-pregnant women with normal body mass index (BMI) were recruited for polysomnography. Conventional analysis of sleep and breathing was performed. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) was determined for each sleep stage. Flow-limitation was analyzed using the flattening index and TcCO2 values were recorded for every inspiration.Results: Eighteen pregnant women and 12 controls were studied. Pregnancy was associated with shorter sleep duration and more superficial sleep. Apnea-hypopnea index, arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation, flow-limitation, snoring or periodic leg movements were similar in the two groups. Mean SaO2 and minimum SaO2 were lower and average heart rate was higher in the pregnant group. TcCO2 levels did not differ between groups but variance of TcCO2 was smaller in pregnant women during non-rapid eye movement (NREM). TcCO2 profiles showed transient TcCO2 peaks, which seem specific to pregnancy.Conclusions: Healthy pregnancy does not predispose to SDB. Enhanced ventilatory control manifests as narrowing threshold of TcCO2 between wakefulness and sleep. Pregnant women have a tendency for rapid CO2 increases during sleep which might have harmful consequences if not properly compensated.

AU  - Carr CA
T2  - JOGNN: Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a support binder for low back pain in pregnancy. DESIGN: Pilot study, using a prospective, two-group design with repeated measures. SETTING: Ambulatory maternity clinic in a tertiary care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Women of at least 20 weeks gestation with low back pain, but no preexisting back or disc disease. Thirty women assigned to the intervention group and 10 to a comparison group. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed a pain assessment at pretest. Intervention participants received a maternity support binder to wear while awake for 2 weeks. At an appointment 2 weeks later, a posttest questionnaire and a taped interview were administered. The comparison group participants received the support binder after the second appointment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Back pain intensity, duration, and effect on daily activities were assessed using a pain in pregnancy questionnaire. RESULTS: The intervention group had significant reduction in mean pain scores and effect of pain on daily activities, including family, house and yard, recreational, exercise, and sleep. Interaction of group by time was significant for change in pain and effect on family, house and yard, and exercise activities. CONCLUSION: The use of a support binder for pregnancy-related low back pain is a promising intervention and was well-accepted by the participants.

TI  - Use of clonazepam and avoidance of sleep deprivation in the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
AU  - Rafiei SM
T2  - Iranian Journal of Child Neurology
AB  - ObjectivesJuvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy(J.M.E.) needs life-long anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment. Of various drugs tried in this condition, valproate effectively treats all types of seizures seen in J.M.E. Among valproate side effects, neural tube defects (NTD) in the offspring, is a deterring factor in its use in childbearing period. To avoid NTD, most authorities advise on switching to AED drug before conception.As well, the effects of valproate on male fertility is feared of. Clonazepam controls only the myoclonic jerks, leaving the patients unprotected and susceptible to generalized seizures, which mostly occur in the morning after sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is the most prevalent precipitating factor for generalized seizures in these patients.Materials &MethodsBetween Jan 2003 & April 2008, 15 newly diagnosed JME patients (9 girls, 6 boys), were given clonazepam (1.0-4.0 mg) at bedtime, and were compared to 16 patients on valproate treatment. All were advised to avoid sleep deprivation.ResultsThis study showed, all patients in the clonazepam group, (100%) had full control of their myoclonic jerks; 4(26.6%) had breakthrough episodes of generalized seizures, provoked by sleep deprivation; the rest (11,73.4%), were in full remission of their myoclonic and generalized seizures. In control group, 2(12.5%), had episodes of breakthrough, sleep-deprived, generalized seizures;the rest(14, 87.5%) were in remission. Statistically, there was no significance between the results in both groups. Clonazepam side effects were limited to mild to moderate drowsiness in the morning, eliminated by giving the dose earlier at night.ConclusionThe study suggests that if J.M.E. patients avoid sleep deprivation, they can be treated with clonazepam alone to avoid side effects of valproate

AB  - Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of using the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) Unicorder for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women. METHODS: Sixteen pregnant women, mean age (SD) = 29.8 (5.4) years, average gestational age (SD) = 28.6 (6.3) weeks, mean body mass index (SD) = 44.7 (6.9) kg/m(2) with signs and symptoms of OSA wore the ARES Unicorder during one night of laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG was scored according to AASM 2007 criteria, and PSG AHI and RDI were compared to the ARES 1%, 3%, and 4% AHIs calculated with the ARES propriety software. RESULTS: Median PSG AHI and PSG RDI were 3.1 and 10.3 events/h of sleep, respectively. Six women had a PSG AHI >= 5 events/h of sleep and 11 had a PSG RDI >= 5 events/h of sleep. PSG AHI and RDI were strongly correlated with the ARES AHI measures. When compared with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, the ARES 3% algorithm provided the best balance between sensitivity (1.0 for PSG AHI, 0.91 for PSG RDI) and specificity (0.5 for PSG AHI, 0.8 for PSG RDI) for detecting sleep disordered breathing in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: The ARES Unicorder demonstrated reasonable consistency with PSG for diagnosing OSA in this small, heterogeneous sample of obese pregnant women.

AB  - We evaluated the psychometric properties of a Mandarin Chinese version of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire‐10 (FOSQ‐10) in pregnant women. A total of 228 first‐trimester pregnant women participated in the study, which was conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .85), adequate corrected item‐total correlations (from.40 to.67), and acceptable test–retest reliability over 7 days (ICC = .73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a one‐factor structure with item loadings between.49 and.77. Significant associations with the Medical Outcomes Study Short‐Form Health Survey 12 version 2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index supported criterion‐related and convergent validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 total scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Ceiling effects were observed for all items, but no floor or ceiling effects were found for total scores. Findings suggest that the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 is a valid and reliable instrument to identify important effects of sleep‐related impairment in Chinese women during pregnancy. Further testing is needed in more diverse pregnant women, such as women with complicated pregnancies and those with sleep disorders. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PSGs were scored by a blinded, experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria; the Watch-PAT was scored automatically by the manufacturer's proprietary software. RESULTS: A total of 31 pregnant women were studied. Mean age was 30.2 ± 7.1 years; mean gestational age was 33.4 ± 3.0 weeks; mean BMI was 31.9 ± 8.1 kg/m(2); 39% of women were nulliparous. Key variables generated by PSG and Watch-PAT correlated well over a wide range, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.76, p < 0.001); respiratory disturbance index (RDI, r = 0.68, p < 0.001), mean oxygen saturation (r = 0.94, p < 0.001), and minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The area under the curve for AHI >= 5 and RDI >= 10 were 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Association between stage 3 sleep on PSG and deep sleep on Watch-PAT was poor. Watch-PAT tended to overscore RDI, particularly as severity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Among pregnant women, Watch-PAT demonstrates excellent sensitivity and specificity for identification of obstructive sleep apnea, defined as AHI >= 5 on full PSG. Watch-PAT may overestimate RDI somewhat, especially at high RDI values.

AB  - Somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite changes, and sleep disruption) are common to both pregnancy and depression. The goal of the present study was to examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820 women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy. When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) is associated with the risk of sleep-disordered breathing in young adulthood. METHODS: The study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5-27.1 years). The principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic snoring. RESULTS: The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education, height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing. CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants with very low birth weight have a twofold risk of sleep-disordered breathing as young adults. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of sleep-disordered breathing by more than twofold.

AB  - OBJETIVE: To determine whether full-term newborn infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) present immature/disorganised EEG patterns in the immediate neonatal period, and whether there was any relationship with maternal glycaemic control. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study with an incidental sample performed in a tertiary hospital neonatal unit. PATIENTS: 23 IDM and 22 healthy newborns born between 2010 and 2013. INTERVENTIONS: All underwent video-EEG recording lasting >90 min at 48-72 h of life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We analysed the percentage of indeterminate sleep, transient sharp waves per hour and mature-for-gestational age EEG patterns (discontinuity, maximum duration of interburst interval (IBI), asynchrony, asymmetry, [delta] brushes, encoches frontales and [alpha]/ rolandic activity). The group of IDM was divided into two subgroups according to maternal HbA1c: (1) HbA1c>=6% and (2) HbA1c<6%. RESULTS: Compared with healthy newborns, IDM presented significantly higher percentage of indeterminate sleep (57% vs 25%; p<0.001), discontinuity (2.5% vs 0%; p=0.044) and [delta] brushes in the bursts (6% vs 3%; p=0.024); higher duration of IBI (0.3 s vs 0 s; p=0.017); fewer encoches frontales (7/h vs 35/h; p<0.001), reduced /[alpha] rolandic activity (3/h vs 9/h; p<0.001); and more transient sharp waves (25/h vs 5/h; p<0.001). IDM with maternal HbA1c>=6% showed greater percentage of [delta] brushes in the burst (14% vs 4%; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Full-term IDM newborns showed video-EEG features of abnormal development of brain function. Maternal HbA1c levels<6% during pregnancy could minimise the risk of cerebral dysmaturity.

AB  - ABSTRACT The aims of this longitudinal study were to examine (a) development of infant sleep and maternal sleep from 3 to 6 months postpartum; (b) concomitant and prospective links between maternal sleep and infant sleep; and (c) triadic links between paternal involvement in infant caregiving and maternal and infant sleep. The study included 57 families that were recruited during pregnancy. Maternal and infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries for 5 nights. Both fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. The results demonstrated moderate improvement in infant and maternal sleep percent between 3 and 6 months. Maternal sleep percent at 3 months significantly predicted infant sleep percent at 6 months. Greater paternal involvement in infant daytime and nighttime caregiving at 3 months significantly predicted more consolidated maternal and infant sleep at 6 months. These findings suggest that maternal sleep is an important predictor of infant sleep and that increased involvement of fathers in infant caregiving responsibilities may contribute to improvements in both maternal and infant sleep during the first 6 months postpartum.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare an indigenous sleep device (wahakura] for infants at high risk for sudden unexpected death with a bassinet, for measures of infant sleep position, head covering, breastfeeding, bed-sharing, and maternal sleep and fatigue. METHODS: A total of 200 mainly Māori pregnant women were recruited from deprived areas of New Zealand. They were randomized to receive a bassinet or wahakura and asked to sleep the infant in this device from birth. Questionnaires at 1, 3, and 6 months and an overnight infrared video in the home at 1 month were completed. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat and an "as-used" analysis of questionnaires showed no group differences at 1, 3, and 6 months in infant-adult direct bed-sharing (7% vs 12%, P = .24 at 1 month), and at the 6-month interview, the wahakura group reported twice the level of full breastfeeding (22.5% vs 10.7%, P = .04). Maternal sleep and fatigue were not significantly different between groups. Video identified no increase in head covering, prone/side sleep position, or bed-sharing in the wahakura group, either from intention-to-treat analysis, or when analyzed for actual sleep location. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in infant risk behaviors in wahakura compared with bassinets and there were other advantages, including an increase in sustained breastfeeding. This suggests wahakura are relatively safe and can be promoted as an alternative to infant-adult bed-sharing. Policies that encourage utilization are likely to be helpful in high-risk populations.

AB  - Oncofertility is one of the 9 NIH Roadmap Initiatives, federal grants intended to explore previously intractable questions, and it describes a new field that exists in the liminal space between cancer treatment and its sequelae, IVF clinics and their yearning, and basic research in cell growth, biomaterials, and reproductive science and its tempting promises. Cancer diagnoses, which were once thought universally fatal, now often entail management of a chronic disease. Yet the therapies are rigorous, must start immediately, and in many cases result in premature failure of the body's reproductive ability. In women, this loss is especially poignant; unlike the routine storage of sperm, which is done in men and boys facing similar treatment decisions, freezing oocytes in anticipation of fertility loss is not possible in most cases, and creating an embryo within days of diagnosis raises significant moral, social and medical challenges. Oncofertility is the study of how to harvest ovarian tissue in women facing cancer to preserve their gametes for future use with IVF, thus allowing the decisions about childbearing to be deferred and reproductive choices to be preserved. The research endeavor uses the capacity of the ovarian follicle to produce eggs in vitro. Developing the human follicle to ovulate successfully outside the body is scientifically difficult and ethically challenging. Infertility is linked to long-standing religious and moral traditions, and is intertwined with deeply contentious social narratives about women, families, illness and birth. Is the research morally permissible? Perhaps imperative if understood as a repair from iatrogenic harms? How are considerations of justice central to the work? How will vulnerable subjects be protected? What are the moral implications of the work for women, children and families? What are the implications for society if women could store ovarian tissue as a way of stopping the biological clock? What are the moral possibilities and challenges if eggs can be produced in large quantities from a stored ovarian tissue?

AB  - Objective: to explore gestational weight gain in healthy women in relation to pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet and physical activity. Design: a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 455 healthy pregnant women of all gestational ages receiving antenatal care from an independent midwife in the Netherlands. Weight gain was assessed using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and classified as below, within, or above the guidelines. A multinomial regression analysis was performed with weight gain classifications as the dependent variable (within IOM-guidelines as reference). Independent variables were pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet (broken down into consumption of vegetables, fruit and fish) and physical activity (motivation to engage in physical activity, pre-pregnancy physical activity and decline in physical activity during pregnancy). Covariates were age, gestational age, parity, ethnicity, family income, education, perceived sleep deprivation, satisfaction with pre-pregnancy weight, estimated prepregnancy body mass index, smoking, having a weight gain goal and having received weight gain advice from the midwife. Findings: forty-two per cent of the women surveyed gained weight within the guidelines. Fourteen per cent of the women gained weight below the guidelines and 44 per cent gained weight above the guidelines. Weight gain within the guidelines, compared to both above and below the guidelines, was not associated with pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index nor with diet. A decline in physical activity was associated with weight gain above the guidelines (OR 0.54, 95 per cent CI 0.33-0.89). Weight gain below the guidelines was seen more often in women who perceived a greater sleep deprivation (OR 1.20, 95 per cent CI 1.02-1.41). Weight gain above the guidelines was seen less often in Caucasian women in comparison to non-Caucasian women (OR 0.22, 95 per cent CI 0.08-0.56) and with women who did not stop smoking during pregnancy (OR 0.49, 95 per cent CI 0.25-0.95). Key conclusions and implications for practice: a decline in physical activity was the only modifiable factor in our population associated with weight gain above the gain recommended by the guidelines. Prevention of reduced physical activity during pregnancy seems a promising approach to promoting healthy weight gain. Interventions to promote healthy weight gain should focus on all women, regardless of pre-pregnancy body mass index.

TI  - What are the relationships among cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, sleep quality, and perinatal outcomes in African-American women?
AU  - Hauff, Nancy J
AB  - Trauma, primarily in the form of intimate partner violence and automobile accidents, accounts for 6-8% of all pregnancy complications. Much less is known about cumulative trauma (CT) exposure especially in African-American women. Women exposed to several types of trauma including childhood abuse, discrimination, or witnessed family violence may develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress or have difficulty sleeping.The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress, sleep, and perinatal outcomes. A sample of 150 essentially healthy African-American women who had given birth were recruited at Hutzel Women's Hospital and St. John Providence Hospital Southfield, and asked to complete the Cumulative Trauma Scale, Community Safety Questionnaire, Conflict Tactics Scale, Clinician-administered PTSD Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Edinburgh Depression Inventory, and Demographic Data Form. The prenatal and hospital medical records were reviewed for multiple maternal and neonatal outcomes. Regression analysis was used to determine if relationships between the variables exist, and the strength of those relationships.The findings of this study showed: 1) African- American women experience traumatic events. 2) cumulative trauma is associated with PTSD, depression, poor sleep quality, and neonatal outcomes; 3) nursing must go beyond the assessment of intimate partner violence, report active trauma, and record findings in the medical record; and 4) more research is needed to better understand mothers' use of over the counter and other medications to help them sleep. The relevance to maternal child health is that a better understanding of cumulative trauma exposure, PTSD, poor sleep, and the risk for poor perinatal outcomes among African-American women can lead to earlier identification and the development of nursing interventions.

T2  - What is the Relationship Between Vitamin D Status, Pregnancy Symptoms & Quality of Life?
AB  - This item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. Purpose and Background/Significance: The main purpose of the study is to determine: (1) to determine if there is a relationship between vitamin D status, pregnancy symptoms, health promoting behaviors, and quality of life and (2) to determine if differences exist in pregnancy symptoms, health promoting behaviors and quality of life between African American and Hispanic women. There is evidence to show that vitamin D deficiency has been associated with numerous symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, poor sleep, and depression. However, whether low levels of vitamin D is associated with these and other symptoms during pregnancy is unknown. What is known is that vitamin D deficiency disproportionately affects pregnant minority women, therefore, this study will help to understand the impact that vitamin D deficiency has on pregnancy symptoms and potential impact on quality of life. Theoretical/ conceptual framework: Using Wilson & Cleary's Health Related Quality of Life model, that the characteristics of the individual (e.g. age, ethnicity) and the environment (e.g. social support) has an important impact on biological factors (e.g. vitamin D status), symptom status (pregnancy symptoms and depression), functional status (health promoting behaviors), all of which ultimately effect the overall health related quality of life. Method: A descriptive, cross sectional design examining women at 24 to 32 weeks gestation. The variables of study include the following: biologic (vitamin D status), symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Pregnancy Symptom Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), functional status (Health Promoting Lifestyles Profilev.2), and quality of life (SF-12). A convenience sample of 125 women from an underserved, low income health center serving a predominantly African American and Hispanic patient population will be recruited. Results: With vitamin D measured on a binary scale as sufficient (vitamin D level >30 ng/ml) versus deficient (vitamin D level <30 ng/ml), both univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models will be used to assess the association between these risk factors and vitamin D status. As a measure of effect size, univariable odds ratios along with their 95% confidence intervals will be reported, and a single multivariable model will report adjusted odds ratios for each factor after controlling for the influence of other significant predictors of vitamin D deficiency.

TI  - Women and insomnia.
AU  - Miller EH
T2  - Clinical Cornerstone
AB  - The occurrence of insomnia in women is influenced in great part by the complex hormonal cycles they undergo. Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women. Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression. Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable. The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guide-lines limiting the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and, as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents.

AB  - Naturally fluctuating hormones (menstrual cycle, through pregnancy or menopausal transition) are not related to marked sleep disturbances in women. It is likely, however, that subsets of women will display a central nervous system vulnerability to hormonal fluctuations so that sleep disturbances manifest as a part of a complex of discomforting symptoms. Sleep is impacted directly through the circadian system or brain sleep regulation or through the development of concurrent functional changes and symptoms. Women are susceptible to sleep-related disorders that are also common in men, such as primary insomnia and SBD although the contributing factors and manifestations may not be the same.

AB  - A woman's sleep is impacted by biology (menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause), sleep disorders (that may manifest differently than in men), and role in the home and workplace. A Women and Sleep Workshop, sponsored by the National Sleep Foundation, in March 2007 reviewed these topics. It was concluded that understanding the relationship between sleep and gender will result in a scientifically based approach to women's sleep problems.

T2  - British Journal of Midwifery
AB  - Background: Women's sexual function can be dramatically affected during and after pregnancy. Aims: To explore Australian women's personal experience of changes in their sexual function during pregnancy and childbirth. Methods: This was an online qualitative survey in which women across Australia who had given birth in the previous 12 months were invited to take part. A total of 273 responses were included. Findings: The five main themes that emerged were: mental health changes; obstetric violence (including lack of support from caregivers, violation of privacy, instrumental delivery and episiotomy); relationship issues (including lack of support from partner, lack of intimacy and domestic violence); physical changes (including birth trauma and negative body image); and role conflict (including role incompatibility, breastfeeding and lack of sleep). Mental health changes were reported to have both positive and negative impacts on women's sexual function. Conclusions: Women experience many changes in their sexual function during and after pregnancy. Health professionals should take an integrated approach to improve women's sexual function and overall wellness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the self-reported prevalence and impact of low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy in primiparous and multiparous women, and their treatment-seeking rationales and experiences, including their use of physiotherapy. METHODS: A sample of 105 post-partum women was recruited. All participants answered a questionnaire; women who experienced LBP during pregnancy (n=71) continue in the study and later they were also interviewed. Content analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Reports of LBP were common (n=71; 67.6%) and slightly more frequent in primiparous (n=40; 56.3%) than multiparous (n=31; 43.7%) women. Multiparous women with LBP were significantly older (p< 0.001) and reported more sleep disturbances (p=0.026) than primiparous women with LBP. LBP prevented women performing their daily activities (n=41; 57.7%) and worsened with the advance of pregnancy (n=55; 77.5%), yet 93.0% (n=66) of these women received no treatment. CONCLUSION: LBP is a prevalent and important clinical condition affecting the daily life of many pregnant women. Nevertheless, few women seek any treatment and physiotherapy is rarely considered. Given the significant impact on quality of life, health professionals need to be proactive in asking women about LBP.

T2  - Clinical Nursing Research
AB  - Women's experiences during late pregnancy and the early postpartum period were examined relative to time of discharge from the hospital. Women who were discharged in 3 days or sooner were compared to women who were discharged after 3 days, with respect to fatigue. A rest and activity questionnaire was completed by the women in the third trimester of pregnancy, in postpartum Week 1, and in postpartum Week 4. Few differences were found with respect to hours slept, number of sleep interruptions, perceptions of tiredness, and impact of tiredness on daily life; tiredness was a major aspect of women's experience, regardless of how long they stayed in hospital. The information will help nurses preparing women for their late pregnancy and postpartum experiences and will ease the concern of those who believe women will be more tired if they leave hospital soon after birth.

T2  - American Journal of Perinatology
AB  - The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the peripartum outcomes of yoga during pregnancy, including the postpartum period and lactation. The PubMed database was analyzed from January 1970 to January 2011. We identified five prospective observational studies (n = 575) and three randomized clinical trials (RCTs; n = 298), which were analyzed separately. The nonrandomized trials indicated a significant reduction in rates of preterm labor (p < 0.0006), intrauterine growth retardation (p <0.003), low birth weight (p < 0.01), pregnancy discomforts (p = 0.01), and perceived sleep disturbances (p = 0.03) in those who practiced yoga during pregnancy. Results of the RCTs indicated that doing yoga during pregnancy can significantly lower pain and discomfort (p < 0.05) and perceived stress (p = 0.001) and improve quality of life in physical domains (p = 0.001). All three RCTs were poorly compliant with the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials statement. While awaiting an appropriately designed RCT to determine the benefits of yoga during pregnancy, it remains a viable exercise option.

AB  - Yoga is a mind-body practice that encompasses a system of postures (asana), deep breathing (pranayama), and meditation. Over 36 million Americans practice yoga of which the majority are reproductive-aged women. Literature to support this practice is limited, albeit on the rise. A prenatal yoga practice has been shown to benefit women who suffer from anxiety, depression, stress, low back pain, and sleep disturbances. A small number of studies have been performed in high-risk pregnancies that also demonstrate an improvement in outcomes. The safety of performing yoga for the first time in pregnancy and fetal tolerance has been demonstrated.

AU  - Weitzel KW
AU  - Wickman JM
AU  - Augustin SG
AU  - Strom JG
T2  - Clinical Therapeutics
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia is the subjective complaint of poor sleep or an inadequate amount of sleep that adversely affects daily functioning. For the past 4 decades, treatment of insomnia has shifted away from the use of barbiturates toward the use of hypnotic agents of the benzodiazepine class. However, problems associated with the latter (eg, next-day sedation, rebound insomnia, dependence, and tolerance) have prompted development of other agents. OBJECTIVE: This review describes the recently approved nonbenzodiazepine agent, zaleplon. METHODS: Studies of zaleplon were identified through a search of English-language articles listed in MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, with no limitation on year. These were supplemented by educational materials from conferences. RESULTS: The efficacy and tolerability of zaleplon have been documented in the literature. Zaleplon has been shown to improve sleep variables in comparison with placebo. Like most hypnotic agents, zaleplon can be used for problems of sleep initiation at the beginning of the night, but its short duration of clinical effect may also allow patients to take it later in the night without residual effects the next morning. Zaleplon can be taken < or = 2 hours before awakening without 'hangover' effects. It is generally well tolerated, with headache being the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials (15%-18%). Compared with flurazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, zaleplon causes significantly less psychomotor and cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). Zaleplon has not been studied in pregnant women or children. The dose of zaleplon should be individualized; the recommended daily dose for most adults is 10 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia has a substantial impact on daily functioning. If pharmacologic treatment is indicated for insomnia, the choice of an agent should be guided by individual patient characteristics.

AB  - Introduction: Women are particularly vulnerable to major depressive disorder sometime throughout their entire lifespan. Their highest risk coincides particularly during pregnancy due to various hormonal, immunological, structural and functional changes that enable the safe delivery of the newborn. In addition, the right sleep habits are important since they help the mother to ensure the necessary maternal energy in order to handle the fetal needs. Aim: To investigate the assessment of depression impact on the sleep habits of pregnant women and its determinants. Material and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted and the study population consisted of 100 women from mid to late-term gestation (second and third trimester of pregnancy). Data were collected by means of an anonymous questionnaire that was completed voluntarily by the participants. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found between the depression during pregnancy score and the sleep quality score (p<0.001). Among the participants, 25% pregnant women in the study were found to be suffering from depression, while 93% reported that they had insufficient sleep during the last month. According to multivariate analysis, pregnant women with a higher level of education, being in a relationship, being employed and having moderate support from their family environment had lower depression score while older women had lower sleep quality score. Conclusions: The observation of high rate of depressive symptoms during pregnancy and its effect on the sleep habits of pregnant women confirms the necessity of early diagnosis and preventive actions.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity in childhood is one of the most important public health problems of the 21st century. Early influences, beginning in intrauterine environmental and continuing through the first few years of life, play important role in weight gain during childhood with consequences that last until adulthood. Purpose: This study is a literature review and aims to study the prenatal and perinatal factors affecting weight gain during early childhood. Materials and Methods: A bibliographical review of relevant articles was conducted at the electronic bases of PubMed and Scolar Google by key-words. Results: The prenatal and perinatal factors associated with weight gain and risk of obesity in children. The maternal smoking during pregnancy, the gestational weight gain and the occurrence of gestational diabetes, high birth weight of infant and short sleep duration are strong risk factors for childhood obesity, while breastfeeding has a protective effect against the increase of body weight. Conclusions: The period from conception to two years of age is a critical period for the appearance of overweight and obesity.

AB  - Backgrounds and Objectives: Changes that occur during pregnancy will definitely change the marital relationships of women. One of the changes in pregnancy is change in the pattern of sleep and insomnia. It is not clear whether there is a relationship between marital satisfaction during pregnancy and insomnia. This study was performed with the aim of determining the relationship between insomnia severity and marital satisfaction in pregnant women referring to health centers in Mashhad city. Methods: This cross-sectional correlational study was conducted on 126 pregnant women (with gestational age of 14-28 weeks) referred to health centers in Mashhad city in 2017. The data collection tool was a demographic questionnaire, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and ENRICH marital satisfaction scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation test, and multiple regression. Results: The mean age of the research units was 26.9±4.3 years, the gestational age was 19.0±2.9 weeks, and the number of pregnancy was 1.9±0.8. In the majority of research units, the insomnia severity was below the threshold (49.2%) and moderate marital satisfaction (57.9%). Based on Spearman's correlation coefficient, there was an inverse and significant linear relationship between insomnia severity and marital satisfaction (r=-0.52, p<0.001). Conclusion: Considering that the severity of insomnia in pregnant women has a significant effect on their marital satisfaction, therefore, caregivers' attention for the insomnia of pregnant women and performing care measures for its reduction, are necessary.
