This reality means the crack-dependent mother requires professional help to be able to care for her newborn child.  Objective:  The purpose of the study is to identify the newborn care difficulties and facilities facing postpartum women who are dependent on crack.  Method: A qualitative study was conducted at a maternity hospital in southern Brazil, through semi-structured interviews with 18 postpartum women.  Results:  The content analysis made it possible to identify a number of difficulties; namely, abstinence from crack cocaine, no breastfeeding, lack of family support, surveillance by professionals from the Guardianship Council, lack of ability to care for the newborn, fear of hurting the newborn and financial problems. As for facilities, it was found the newborns of crack-dependent mothers cry little and are quiet and tranquil. Support from family members, neighbors and friends and financial help from the partner and the family are possible resources as well.  Conclusion:  Crack-dependent postpartum women need help to fulfill their role as newborn caregivers. They should be identified during pregnancy so as to receive guidance during the prenatal period and orientation on newborn care and the support services to which they are entitled.","2018-01","2019-02-13 20:34:08","2019-02-13 20:34:08","","32-42","","1","18","","Aquichan","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Colômbia","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/aqui/v18n1/1657-5997-aqui-18-01-00032.pdf","Cocaína; crack; crack cocaine; disorders related to substance abuse; enfermagem; enfermería; newborn, nursing; período pós-parto; periodo postparto; Postpartum period; recém-nascido; recién nacido; transtornos relacionados ao uso de substâncias; trastornos relacionados con el uso de narcóticos","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These factors may cause blood stagnation, swelling of the legs, or endothelial damage and consequently lead to development of venous disease.  Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of special footwear designed to improve blood circulation in the feet on venous blood flow changes observed during advancing phases of pregnancy.  Methods Thirty healthy pregnant women participated in this study at 25, 30, and 35 weeks of gestation. Participants were allocated at random to an experimental group (n = 15) which was provided with the special footwear, or a control group (n = 15). At each data collection session, Doppler measurements of peak systolic blood flow velocity and cross-sectional area of the right popliteal vein were performed using a MySonoU6 ultrasound machine with a linear transducer (Samsung Medison). The differences were compared using Cohen’s d test to calculate effect size.  Results With advancing phases of pregnancy, peak systolic velocity in the popliteal vein decreased significantly in the control group, whereas it increased significantly in the experimental group. No significant change in cross-sectional area was observed in any of the groups.  Conclusions Findings in the experimental group demonstrated that wearing the footwear tested may prevent venous blood velocity from reducing during advanced phases of pregnancy. Nevertheless, there is a need for further investigation of the beneficial effect on venous flow of the footwear tested and its application.","2017-09-28","2019-02-13 20:34:12","2019-02-13 20:34:12","","214-219","","3","16","","Jornal Vascular Brasileiro","","","","","","","","en","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jvb/v16n3/1677-5449-jvb-1677-5449002617.pdf","pregnancy; calçados experimentais; circulatory system; experimental footwear; fluxo sanguíneo venoso; gravidez; popliteal vein; sistema circulatório; veia poplítea; venous blood flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of eleven mongrel female dogs were enrolled in a longitudinal prospective investigation. Six animals were bred during the study and were assigned into group I, in which evaluations were performed during proestrus, estrus, gestational diestrus and anestrus. The five remaining bitches were not bred and underwent evaluations during proestrus, estrus, nongestational diestrus and anestrus. The holter data showed a gradual increase in the minimum and mean heart rate along pregnancy, as well as a reduction during anestrus, which differed significantly among the distinct periods. The values for maximal heart rate documented during pregnancy were significantly lower than those recorded during anestrus, and a variation in the heart rate circadian rhythm was also found, as demonstrated by decreases at night and rises during the day. Cardiac rhythm had a similar performance in both pregnancy and anestrus. Likewise, the blood pressure, electrocardiography, and echocardiography data did not vary during the estrous cycle. The results support the role played by the autonomic nervous system during these two distinct periods in order to attain a heart rate that provides the blood needed by the female’s body during the various stages of the reproductive cycle. Further studies are needed to better clarify the cardiovascular compensatory neuroendocrine events that accompany gestation in this species.","2017-03","2019-02-13 20:34:13","2019-02-13 20:34:13","","295-299","","3","37","","Pesquisa Veterinária Brasileira","","","","","","","","en","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/pvb/v37n3/1678-5150-pvb-37-03-00295.pdf","pregnancy; cardiovascular system; bitches; cadelas; cão; Cardiac parameters; ciclo estral; ciclo reprodutivo; dog; estrous cycle; gestação; Parâmetros cardíacos; reproductive cycle; sistema cardiovascular","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes contribute to the emergence of low back pain, which may influence the quality of sleep during pregnancy.  Objective  To compare the quality of sleep among pregnant women with and without low back pain during pregnancy, examining the relationship between two variables.  Materials methods  Thirty volunteers aged between 19 and 36 years, divided into control group (CG – n = 16) and Study Group (SG – n = 14), residents in the cities of Natal, were evaluated in the second trimester of pregnancy. To sleep evaluation were used to index the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Low back pain was evaluated using the pressure algometer, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index. Statistical analysis used the Shapiro Wilk test, Student’s T test for independent samples and Pearson correlation test.  Results  The mean gestational and chronological ages were 28.2 ± 3.4 years and 19.9 ± 3.7 weeks, respectively. Sleep quality was lower in SG (8.21 ± 4.8) when compared to CG (5.94 ± 1.7) and was statistically significant (P = 0.021). Analyzing the relationship between sleep quality and pain intensity, it was observed that the variables have a positive correlation between them (r = 0.372, P = 0.043).

The rats were distributed into control (CTRL) and pregnant (PN) groups. After a baseline evaluation of their behavior and locomotor activity in an open-field environment, the PN group was inducted into pregnancy, and their behavior and locomotor activity were evaluated on days 3, 10 and 19 of pregnancy and in the post-lactation period in parallel with the CTRL group. The serum iron and transferrin levels in the CTRL and PN groups were analyzed in blood collected after euthanasia by decapitation.RESULTS:There were no significant differences in the total ambulation, grooming events, fecal boli or urine pools between the CTRL and PN groups. However, the PN group exhibited fewer rearing events, increased grooming time and reduced immobilization time than the CTRL group (ANOVA, p<0.05).CONCLUSION:These results suggest that pregnant rats show behavioral and locomotor alterations similar to those observed in animal models of RLS, demonstrating to be a possible animal model of this sleep disorder.","2014-10-03","2019-02-13 20:34:22","2019-02-13 20:34:22","","436-441","","10","36","","Revista Brasileira de Ginecologia e Obstetrícia","","","","","","","","en","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbgo/v36n10/0100-7203-rbgo-0100-7203-2014-0005105.pdf","Pregnancy; Gravidez; Atividade motora; Motor activity; Ratos Wistar; Rats, Wistar; Restless legs syndrome; Síndrome das pernas inquietas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conclusions: Sleep disorders are common in primary care patients and family physicians are well placed to diagnose and treat them. The PSQI is a good instrument for assessing sleep quality.","2014-02","2019-02-13 20:34:23","2019-02-13 20:34:23","","16-22","","1","30","","Revista Portuguesa de Medicina Geral e Familiar","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Portugal","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.mec.pt/pdf/rpmgf/v30n1/v30n1a04.pdf","Cuidados de Saúde Primários; Primary Care; Qualidade do Sono; Sleep Quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SOURCES: A review of literature found on MEDLINE/ PubMed database. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The literature consistently shows that breastfeeding provides a wide range of benefits for both the child and the mother. The psychological benefits for the mother are still in need of further research. Some studies point out that pregnancy depression is one of the factors that may contribute to breastfeeding failure. Others studies also suggest an association between breastfeeding and postpartum depression; the direction of this association is still unclear. Breastfeeding can promote hormonal processes that protect mothers against postpartum depression by attenuating cortisol response to stress. It can also reduce the risk of postpartum depression, by helping the regulation of sleep and wake patterns for mother and child, improving mother's selfefficacy and her emotional involvement with the child, reducing the child's temperamental difficulties, and promoting a better interaction between mother and child. CONCLUSIONS: Studies demonstrate that breastfeeding can protect mothers from postpartum depression, and are starting to clarify which biological and psychological processes may explain this protection. However, there are still equivocal results in the literature that may be explained by the methodological limitations presented by some studies.","2013-08","2019-02-13 20:34:27","2019-02-13 20:34:27","","332-338","","4","89","","Jornal de Pediatria","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","; ","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jped/v89n4/en_v89n4a03.pdf; http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jped/v89n4/v89n4a03.pdf","Postpartum depression; Amamentação; Breastfeeding; Depressão na gravidez; Depressão pós-parto; Hormones; Hormônios; Pregnancy depression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Population-based, case-control study with children born between January 1st, 2001, and December 31st, 2003, in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, who were allocated into three groups: SIDS cases (33), explained death controls (192), and living controls (192). Children in the latter two groups were age- and sex-paired with SIDS cases. Families in which an infant had died at home within the first year of life were identified, and the information available on death certificates and autopsy reports was compared to confirm the diagnosis of SIDS. Explained death controls consisted of infants who had died at city hospitals, and living controls were selected in the same neighborhood as SIDS cases. All parents were interviewed to obtain information on children’s health and sleep habits. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors in the study population. RESULTS: The incidence of SIDS in the population assessed was 0.55/1,000 live births. The analysis revealed the following risk factors: ethnicity (characterized by self-reported black skin color), prematurity, low birth weight, adolescent mother, smoking during pregnancy, and family income of less than one minimum wage. Ninety-four percent of SIDS cases were misdiagnosed in the death certificate. CONCLUSIONS: Although SIDS was misdiagnosed in official death certificates, the epidemiological profile is similar to the literature, as well as risk factors, which could be reduced with preventive campaigns. Investigating SIDS in developing countries requires special strategies to avoid misdiagnosis.","2011-04","2019-02-13 20:34:31","2019-02-13 20:34:31","","115-122","","2","87","","Jornal de Pediatria","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","; ","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jped/v87n2/en_v87n2a06.pdf; http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jped/v87n2/v87n2a06.pdf","epidemiology; epidemiologia; posição de decúbito ventral durante o sono; prone sleeping position; SIDS; SMSL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 12 month old babies from these women are also part of the sample. In order to assess depressive symptoms in the mothers, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used and the following sleeping behaviors of the babies were investigated: hours of sleep per day, regularity of sleep and wake up time, disturbed sleep and night awakening. Poisson Regression was used for the analysis. RESULTS: 35.7% of the babies showed alterations in their sleeping patterns. After adjusting for the proposed hierarchal model, sleep alteration of the babies was still associated with the depressive symptoms of the mothers (p < 0,01).

In this review, the most important cyclic anesthetic-obstetric parameters in parturient care are listed. CONTENTS: Chronobiological analysis of the main events in the obstetric pathophysiology of Mulier sapiens: I) Embryogenesis - risk of teratogenesis; II) From prematurity to post-didacticism: from eutocic labor to cervical cerclage; III) Night and labor: higher incidence of nocturnal labor (physiological facilitation) and daylight cesarean section (choice of the obstetrician); IV) The moon and labor - non-conclusive results; V) The night shift in obstetric anesthesia: riskier professional contingency; VI) Phases of cesarean section: removal of the fetus: UD stage (uterotomy - delivery) as brief as possible; effective correction of hypotension and valorize pre-anesthetic fasting; VII) circadian variation of dystocia: pain; uterine contraction; blood loss; hypertension (HTN); risk of allergy and asthma. In the nocturnal phase, the intensity of contraction and risk of hemorrhage, allergy, and asthma are greater. On the other hand, HTN in eclampsia does not show circadian variation; VIII) Obstetric chronopharmacology: local anesthetics, analgesics, hypnotics, general anesthetics, and neuromuscular blockers. Chronoenergy explains the matinal peak of opioid analgesia, vespertine of local anesthetic, and nocturnal of inhalational anesthetics. CONCLUSIONS: The chronobiological approach of labor anesthesia emphasizes the obstetric importance of circadian rhythmicity in labor humanization and safety.","2009-10","2019-02-13 20:34:45","2019-02-13 20:34:45","","624-647","","5","59","","Revista Brasileira de Anestesiologia","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","; ","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rba/v59n5/en_v59n5a13.pdf; http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rba/v59n5/v59n5a13.pdf","ANESTESIA Obstétrica; ANESTHESIA, Obstetrics; CHRONOBIOLOGY; CIRURGIA, Obstétrica; CRONOBIOLOGIA; SURGERY, Obstetric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to follow-up, prospectively, one family with identical twins, analyzing the influence of assumptions and social practices expressed in their discourse on the language development and the construction process of each child's identity, from the diagnosis of monozygotic twin pregnancy. METHODS: The study is based on the naturalist/observational approach, the historic-cultural perspective and the indiciary paradigm. Eight interviews were video recorded every three months since the diagnosis of identical twin pregnancy in one family, and information regarding the following categories were analyzed: the announcement of pregnancy, choice of names, clothes, family interaction, general routine, language and identity of each child. RESULTS: All analyzed categories were referred by the family during the interviews, and revealed their difficulty in assimilating the presence of two different children, who end up being seen as one child. CONCLUSION: The social aspects that come along with the similarities of monozygotic twins are remarkable enough to overcome and change its influence on these children's processes of language and identity development. The Speech-Language Pathology has an important role to support these families in the context of their beliefs and values, so that the intervention, when necessary, is effective.","2008","2019-02-13 20:34:59","2019-02-13 20:34:59","","267-271","","3","13","","Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Fonoaudiologia","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rsbf/v13n3/a11v13n3.pdf","Child guidance; Family relations; Gemelaridade monozigótica; Hábitos; Habits; Language; Linguagem; Orientação infantil; Relações familiares; Social values; Twinning, monozygotic; Valores sociais","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of twenty-one preterm newborns of both genders and mean gestational and chronological ages of 32 weeks (± 1.7) and 27 days (± 15.2), respectively, who were assessed while still in hospital. The medical files were used to collect data on the gestation, delivery, complications developed and on the Neonatal Medical Index (NMI). The newborns were evaluated using the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI) in seven categories: scarf sign, motor development and vigor, popliteal angle, alertness and orientation, irritability, cry quality and percent asleep. The data were analyzed using SPSS® statistical software based on descriptive statistics (frequencies, means and standard deviations), Student's t test for comparison of groups (study sample versus normative NAPI sample) and Spearman's correlation test (clinical variables and NAPI categories). RESULTS: The preterm newborns' performance was statistically significantly different from the normative NAPI group in relation to the variables of scarf sign, motor development and vigor and cry quality. The NMI correlated negatively with scarf sign (r= -0.60). Alert behavioral state during inactivity correlated positively with motor development and vigor (r= 0.59) and with cry quality (r= 0.71). The most frequent maternal complications were genitourinary tract infection (47%) and gestational arterial hypertension (24%), and the neonatal complications were hyaline membrane syndrome (86%), neonatal infection (57%) and hyperbilirubinemia (47%).

METHODS: We followed 29 primiparous adolescents from the prenatal period through the 12th week of the puerperium, with a mean of sixteen years of age, served at the Outpatient Facility for Adolescents of Maternidade Escola Assis Chateaubriand (MEAC) of Universidade Federal do Ceará (Fortaleza, Brazil). The pregnant adolescents were divided into two groups, that is, those who remained normotensive (Group I) and those who developed PH (Group II). The variables investigated in the assessment of the value of predictability for the development of PH were anthropometric measures, socioeconomic aspects, smoking habit, inheritance for SAH (father/mother), prenatal tests requested in the first prenatal care visit in addition to microalbuminuria and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in the 28th week of gestation. The pregnant adolescents were followed up at delivery and late puerperium (12th week after the puerperium). The newborns to the mothers included in our study were assessed at birth according to the Apgar score and the Capurro method, for weight, height and perinatal hypoxia. RESULTS: The prevalence of PH was 51.7%. Inheritance for SAH presented the highest predictive value for PH with an odds ratio of 10.99. Diastolic arterial pressure equal to or above 70 mmHg at the gestational age of 35 weeks was statistically significant as a predictive value for PH. At ABPM we found a predictive value for PH: diastolic pressure load during alertness, diastolic and systolic pressure load during night sleep, pressure variability and maximum diastolic pressure during sleep. Specifically a maximum diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) at ABPM during the period of night sleep ³64 mmHg presented an odds ratio of 6 for PH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 60% for the development of PH. CONCLUSION: The research for PH predictive factors in primiparous adolescents showed to be easy to apply and useful to stratify high-risk pregnant women as regards the development of PH.","2006-10","2019-02-13 20:35:11","2019-02-13 20:35:11","","487-495","","4","87","","Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","; ","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/abc/v87n4/14.pdf; http://www.scielo.br/pdf/abc/v87n4/en_14.pdf","ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM); gestação na adolescência; Gestational hypertensive; Hipertensão gestacional; microalbuminuria; microalbuminúria; monitorização ambulatorial da pressão arterial (MAPA); pregnancy in adolescents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been speculated that comorbid depression and anxiety among females may contribute to a higher incidence of insomnia. In addition, periods of intense hormonal variability (e.g.; pregnancy/postpartum, menopause transition) appear to be associated with higher incidence of sleep disturbances in females. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the menopausal transition constitutes a period of heightened risk for the occurrence of depressive symptoms and vasomotor complaints, as well as insomnia. This article reviews the clinical and hormone factors that may play a role for the development of insomnia during the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Treatment options are critically reviewed, including cognitive-behavioral techniques, hormonal treatments, hypnotics, antidepressants, and complimentary/alternative medicine.","2006","2019-02-13 20:35:17","2019-02-13 20:35:17","","103-109","","2","33","","Archives of Clinical Psychiatry (São Paulo)","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rpc/v33n2/a10v33n2.pdf","menopause; estrógenos; estrogens; hipnóticos; hypnotics; Insomnia; Insônia; menopausa; mulheres; women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Prospective study of eight cases diagnosed with TTTS evaluated in our service from january 2001 to june 2005. Through percutaneous introduction of a 2,0mm diameter fetoscope in the uterine cavity, placental surface vessels where directly visualized. Those identified as responsible for the transfusion were laser coagulated. The procedure combines ultrasonography and fetoscopy, in a so-called sonoendoscopic technique (FETENDO). RESULTS: Among the eight pregnancies evaluated, five cases were submitted to the procedure (10 fetuses). All fetuses survived for at least five weeks after surgery. A total of eight fetuses were born alive and five survived the neonatal period. In a 18 months follow-up after birth, all five are still alive and well and their mean age is now 10,6 months. The total survival rate was 50% and in three pregnancies, at least one fetus survived. CONCLUSIONS: Laser fetoscopy is actually the ""gold-standard"" treatment of TTTS. Nevertheless is a sophisticated technique that epends of proper training. Our service is the first in our country to offer this therapeutic technique.

METHOD: SD were investigated in three hundred pregnant women 11- to 40-years-old through with a brief clinical interview based on directed questions. One hundred pregnant women were considered for each trimester. RESULTS: The rate of pregnant women with insomnia increased by 23% in the 2nd trimester (p< 0.005); the rate for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) by 15% in the 1st trimester (p<0.003), 55% in the 2nd trimester (p<0.001) and by 14% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.002); the rate for mild sleepiness increased by 33% in the 2nd trimester (p<0.002) and by 48% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.001); the rate for specific awakenings increased by 63% in the 1st trimester, by 80% in the 2nd trimester and by 84% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.001).

Mental hygiene, we believe, may only be efficient when oriented by this discipline. That is the line we follow in our Mental Health Service at the Public Health Clinic of Santana district, São Paulo City. This paper summarizes some data concerning the 300 counselees among 317 ³ seen there from February through July 15, 1952. Even though such data were obtained under close clinical criterion, they have not been statistically evaluated as regards heredobiological aspects: therefore, our conclusions must be taken as provisional. However, some of the recorded findings seem to deserve discussion. Table 1 shows that most frequent conditions met with were: petit mal attacks (32 per cent), irritability (20.6 per cent), headache (20 per cent), atypical epileptic equivalents (12.6 per cent), hyperemotivity (11 per cent); neurosis was diagnosed 15 instances, i.e., in 6.9 per cent of the adults. Relative frequency rates are, however, more illustrative: out of 115 women who had completed at least one pregnancy, 27.8 per cent had miscarried, 13 per cent produced stillbirths, 3.5 per cent suffered eclampsia, 3.5 per cent had surgical delivery. Twin maternities were 11 in number, representing 3.4 per cent of a series of 325 confinements 4, as compared to 1.2 per cent in the average population. Table 2 lists clinical entries for the 84 children of this material, 42 of each sex: night terror, petit mal attacks, seizures, hyperactivity, irritability, were the leading ones. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, for the age range 1-3.5 years (with 22 children), we recorded night terror in 71.5 per cent, hyperactivity in 54.5 per cent, temper tantrums in 54.5 per cent, seizures in 36.3 per cent; and for that of 7-14 years, assembling 39 children, chief disturbances were petit mal (43.5 per cent), irritability (33.3 per cent), headache (30.8 per cent), hyperemotivity (30.8 per cent). The heredological meaning of the above clinical data has helped us in the selection for psychoterapy and home adjustment, as well as to institute the proper medication when needed. A follow-up of 64 children enrolled up to June 1952 disclosed that (1) psychological reorientation was efficient for obstinacy, shyness, maladjustment, enuresis; (2) it was needed to supplement it with medication in temper tantrums, retardation in school, aggressivity; (3) medication alone was enough for petit mal, night terror, panicky reactions, seizures, breathholding spells, sleep disturbances.","1956-06","2019-02-13 20:35:37","2019-02-13 20:35:37","","117-135","","2","14","","Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria","","","","","","","","pt","","","SciELO Brasil","","http://www.scielo.org/","","","","","http://www.scielo.br/pdf/anp/v14n2/02.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
