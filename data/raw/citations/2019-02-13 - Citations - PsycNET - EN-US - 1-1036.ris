AB  - Background: The prevalence of pregnancy-associated insomnia is high. Although insomnia may flow from normal physiologic features of pregnancy, it may also be an early warning sign of a relapse, or a trigger for a relapse, of a psychiatric illness. Those at risk for psychiatric illnesses may require medications as well as behavioral and psychotherapeutic interventions, to prevent relapse in the perinatal period. Unfortunately, few reviews of psychotropics used to treat pregnancy-related sleep disorders exist. Objective: We discuss issues related to sleep and sleep disorders in pregnancy in the context of co-morbid psychiatric illness, and review the literature on the commonly-used medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, antihistamines, trazodone, and melatonin) for insomnia during pregnancy.

T2  - Psychology, Health & Medicine
AB  - This study sought to investigate the effects of subjectively-determined poor prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depression (PND), after adjusting for prenatal psychological distress and perceived stress. From March 2016 to December 2017, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study using a convenience sample of 228 perinatal women. The participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during the third trimester (Time 1 or T1), and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 1 months postpartum (Time 2 or T2). Logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depression. The results showed that prenatal psychological distress (OR = 2.551, 95% CI = 1.221 ~ 5.329, P = 0.013) and perceived stress (OR = 2.881, 95% CI = 1.398 ~ 5.938, P= 0.007) were the strongest predictors of PND. Independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality (OR = 2.391, 95% CI = 1.072 ~ 5.556, P = 0.044) during pregnancy also predicted postnatal depressive symptoms. Treatment of psychological distress and perceived stress appears important for reducing the incidence of PND. Nonetheless, future studies might explore treatments to improve prenatal sleep quality.

AB  - Depressive symptoms, stress, fatigue, and lack of sleep are often experienced by women in the perinatal period and are potential contributors to adverse maternal and child health outcomes. To explore the evolution of symptoms and identify groups of women of similar severity and patterns, we utilized clustering of multidimensional symptom trajectories. In an observational study data were collected from pregnant women in the 3rd trimester (36 weeks prenatal) and in the postnatal period at weeks 1 and 2 as well as at 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, and 6‐months postpartum. Depressive symptoms and maternal stress were measured using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), respectively. Self‐reported duration of sleep and levels of fatigue also were collected. A model‐based clustering approach was used to classify women by their symptom severity. The sample included 151 pregnant women with a 6‐month follow‐up. Two clusters were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 43) comprised women with fewer depressive symptoms, less perceived stress, lower likelihood of being fatigued, increased sleep duration and a negative trend in EPDS (β = −0.05, CI [−0.09, −0.001]), and PSS (β = −0.09, CI [−0.17, −0.01]). Cluster 2 (n = 108) comprised women with higher EPDS and PSS scores, increased likelihood of fatigue and lower sleep duration with a positive trend in sleep hours (β = −0.02, CI [0.01, 0.03]). Pro‐inflammatory markers interleukin‐6 and tumor necrosis factor‐α were associated with longer sleep duration and fewer depressive symptoms, respectively. Using this methodology in maternal and child health research can potentially predict women's risk of developing severe symptoms and help clinicians provide timely interventions.

AB  - Background and Aims In‐utero exposure to opioids including buprenorphine (BUP) has been shown to affect fetal activity, specifically heart‐rate variability (FHRV) and fetal movement (FM). Our objective was to extract simultaneous recordings of fetal cardiac and brain‐related activity in BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women using a novel non‐invasive biomagnetic technique. Design A pilot study was conducted, recording and analyzing biomagnetic data from fetuses of BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women. Signals were acquired with the non‐invasive 151‐channel SARA (SQUID‐Array for Reproductive Assessment) system. Advanced signal‐processing techniques were applied to extract fetal heart and brain activity. Setting University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA). Participants Eight BUP‐maintained pregnant women from UAMS Women's Mental Health Program between gestational ages (GA) of 29–37 weeks who were treated with 8–24 mg of BUP daily. Sixteen pregnant women with no known opioid exposure in the same GA range were also included. Measurements Outcome measures from the fetal heart and brain signals included: heart rate (FHR), FM, FHR accelerations, FHR–FM coupling, FHRV, fetal behavioral states (FBS) and power spectral density (PSD) of spontaneous brain activity. These measures were analyzed at three GA intervals. Findings Fetal heart and brain activity parameters were extracted and quantified successfully from 18 non‐opioid and 16 BUP recordings. Overall analysis in both groups show that: FHR and FM ranged from 131 to 141 beats per minute (b.p.m.) and 5 to 11 counts, respectively. In the 35–37 weeks GA, the coupling duration (~9 s) was the shortest, while three of the FHRV parameters were the highest. The PSD of brain activity revealed highest power in 0.5‐4 Hz bandwidth. Transitions in FBS from quiet to active sleep were > 50% of sessions. Conclusions This pilot study showed that a novel biomagnetic technique allows simultaneous quantification of cardiac and brain activities of a group of buprenorphine‐exposed and non‐exposed fetuses in the third trimester.

T2  - Health Psychology Review
AB  - Men appear to gain weight during the transition to parenthood, and fathers are heavier than non-fathers. Paternal perinatal weight gain may set weight trajectories in midlife and have long-term health implications. Since men do not undergo the physical demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding, the specific mechanisms underlying weight gain in new fathers warrant investigation. This review aims to stimulate research on paternal perinatal weight gain by suggesting testable potential mechanisms that (1) show change across the transition to parenthood and (2) play a role in weight and body composition. We identify seven mechanisms, within three categories: behavioural mechanisms (sleep, physical activity, and diet), hormonal mechanisms (testosterone and cortisol), and psychological mechanisms (depression and stress). We also discuss direct effects of partner pregnancy influences (e.g., ‘couvade syndrome’) on men’s body weight. In presenting each mechanism, we discuss how it may be affected by the transition to parenthood, and then review its role in body composition and weight. Next, we describe bidirectional and interactive effects, discuss timing, and present three broad research questions to propel theoretical development.

AB  - This study leverages psychiatric intake data from treatment-seeking perinatal women aiming to explore the understudied associations between childhood adversity, sleep quality, and severity of perinatal mental illness in this population. The sample is 578 perinatal women presenting for initial evaluation to a university-based perinatal psychiatry clinic. At intake, we collected demographics, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), sleep quality, and diagnosis and symptom severity of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Clinician-rated diagnoses showed that 65% of women met criteria for major depression, 23% for generalized anxiety disorder and 4% for PTSD; almost 30% of women had childhood adversity and 98.2% reported poor perinatal sleep quality. Regression analyses revealed differential associations between ACEs and sleep quality and perinatal mood symptoms; ACEs were significantly associated with pregnancy and postpartum PTSD, whereas sleep quality was associated with perinatal depression and generalized anxiety. Screening for ACEs and sleep quality during perinatal intake has high clinical utility, as these two factors significantly contribute to symptom severity across peripartum.

TI  - Depletion of embryonic microglia using the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 has adverse sex-specific effects on mice, including accelerated weight gain, hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behaviour.

T2  - Brain, Behavior, and Immunity
AB  - Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Originally thought to be primarily responsible for disposing of cellular debris and responding to neural insults, emerging research now shows that microglia are highly dynamic cells involved in a variety of neurodevelopmental processes. The hypothalamus is a brain region critical for maintaining homeostatic processes such as energy balance, thirst, food intake, reproduction, and circadian rhythms. Given that microglia colonize the embryonic brain alongside key steps of hypothalamic development, here we tested whether microglia are required for the proper establishment of this brain region. The Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (Csf1r) is expressed by microglia, macrophages and osteoclasts, and is required for their proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Therefore, to eliminate microglia from the fetal brain, we treated pregnant dams with the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. We showed that approximately 99% of microglia were eliminated by embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) after pregnant dams were placed on a PLX5622 diet starting at E3.5. Following microglia depletion, we observed elevated numbers of apoptotic cells accumulating throughout the developing hypothalamus. Once the PLX5622 diet was removed, microglia repopulated the postnatal brain within 7 days and did not appear to repopulate from Nestin+ precursors. Embryonic microglia depletion also resulted in a decreased litter size, as well as an increase in the number of pups that died within the first two postnatal days of life. In pups that survived, the elimination of microglia in the fetal brain resulted in a decrease in the number of Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and a concomitant accelerated weight gain starting at postnatal day 5 (P5), suggesting that microglia could be important for the development of cell types key to hypothalamic satiety centers. Moreover, surviving PLX5622 exposed animals displayed craniofacial and dental abnormalities, perhaps due to non-CNS effects of PLX5622 on macrophages and/or osteoclasts. Finally, depletion of microglia during embryogenesis had long-term sex-specific effects on behaviour, including the development of hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behaviour in juvenile and adult female mice, respectively. Together, these data demonstrate an important role for microglia during the development of the embryonic hypothalamus, and perhaps the CNS more broadly.

TI  - Cognitive functioning of female nurses during the night shift: The impact of age, clock time, time awake and subjective sleepiness.
AU  - Zion, Nataly

T2  - Chronobiology International
AB  - Decline in cognitive functioning in the workplace is a major concern for health care systems. Understanding factors associated with nighttime functioning is imperative for instituting organizational risk management policies and developing personalized countermeasures. The present study aims to identify individual factors associated with cognitive functioning during the night shift of hospital nurses working on irregular rotating-shift schedules. Ninety-two female nurses were recruited from 17 wards in two general hospitals, using convenience sampling by clusters. Inclusion criteria were working at least 28 h a week (75% of full time) and one night shift per week. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, diagnosed sleep disorders or medical conditions that may affect sleep and/or function. Cognitive performance was measured during the middle (03:00 h) and at the end (07:00 h) of the night shift using the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) and the Letter Cancellation Task (LCT) over two night shifts. Subjective sleepiness was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) at the same time points. All participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire for Shift-Workers (MCTQShift) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep duration 24 h before the night shift and time awake since last sleep opportunity were monitored by actigraphy. Univariate repeated measures ANOVA found main effects for clock time (p p p p p p p p < 0.01) for LCT omission errors. All factors remained significant in a mixed-model analysis for DSST. Cognitive performance among hospital nurses is low during the middle of the night shift and increases at the end of the shift; decreased functioning is associated with increased subjective sleepiness, older age and prolonged time awake. Identifying factors contributing to performance during the night shift may provide a basis for the development of risk management policies and preventative interventions.

T2  - Brain, Behavior, and Immunity
AB  - Women who have experienced significant adversities during childhood and adulthood are at risk for excessive inflammation during pregnancy, but the mechanisms are unclear. Using structural equation modeling, we examined pathways from childhood abuse history and current socioeconomic status (SES) to inflammatory markers through indicators of health risk, recent stressors, and psychological distress in 214 women assessed at mid-pregnancy (5–31 weeks gestation). Self-reported data on socioeconomic indicators, childhood trauma history, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), smoking, sleep quality, interpersonal conflict, recent life events, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were collected, and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined. In separate models, pre-pregnancy BMI, sleep quality, and interpersonal conflict statistically explained the relationship between adversity and inflammation. These three intermediate variables were then entered into a multiple mediation analysis to examine unique effects. Childhood abuse history and current SES both demonstrated significant indirect effects on CRP through pre-pregnancy BMI, and current SES showed a significant indirect effect on IL-6 through all intermediate variables. When examining each indirect pathway individually, pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict emerged as parallel pathways by which low current SES leads to elevated IL-6; the indirect pathway through sleep quality was no longer significant. Pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict are two independent mechanisms by which adversity is associated with increased inflammation during pregnancy. Women who have been exposed to significant adversity may be at particular risk for obesity, sleep disruption, and interpersonal conflict, with implications for immune dysregulation during pregnancy.

AB  - AbstractBackgroundThe prevalence of sleep problems among pregnant women is over 50%, and daytime sleepiness is among the most common sleep problems. Previous studies have associated antenatal sleep problems with adverse maternal health and neonatal outcomes, but the consequences of antenatal sleep problems and particularly daytime sleepiness on child psychological development have not been assessed prospectively.MethodsIn this prospective cohort study including 111 mother-child dyads, we examined the associations of maternal daytime sleepiness during pregnancy, assessed at 17 and 28 weeks of gestation using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with child neuropsychiatric problems and neuropsychological development, assessed with mother-rated questionnaires and individually administered neuropsychological tests, at child age 2.6–5.7 years (mean = 4.3 years).ResultsIndependently of sociodemographic and perinatal covariates and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during and/or after pregnancy, maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness was associated with increased total [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) = 0.25 standard deviation (s.d.) units; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01–0.48] and internalizing (B = 0.25 s.d.s: 95% CI 0.01–0.49) psychiatric problems and ADHD symptoms (B = 0.27 s.d.s: 95% CI 0.04–0.50) in children, and with poorer executive function, particularly in the areas of attention, working memory and inhibitory control (B = −0.39 s.d.s: 95% CI −0.69 to −0.10).ConclusionsMaternal antenatal daytime sleepiness carries adverse consequences for offspring psychological development. The assessment of sleep problems may be an important addition to standard antenatal care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A preference for eveningness (being a “night owl”) and preterm birth (n = 346). We also compared very low birth weight (VLBW, n = 138/221/329) ESTER participants. The MEQ consists of 19 questions, which estimates the respondent to be of a “morning”, “evening,” or “intermediate” chronotype, based on the Morningness–Eveningness Score (MES). We analyzed the data from the actigraphs and the MES with three linear regression models, and analyzed distribution of the chronotype class with Pearson χ2. There were no consistent differences across the study groups in sleep midpoint. As compared with those born at term, the mean differences in minutes:seconds and 95% confidence intervals for the sleep midpoint were: early preterm weekdays 11:47 (−8:34 to 32:08), early preterm weekend 4:14 (−19:45 to 28:13), late preterm weekdays −10:28 (−26:16 to 5:21), and late preterm weekend −1:29 (−20:36 to 17:37). There was no difference in sleep timing between VLBW-participants and controls either. The distribution of chronotype in the MEQ among all participants was 12.4% morningness, 65.4% intermediate, and 22.2% eveningness. The distribution of the subjective chronotype class did not differ between the three gestational age groups (p = 0.98). The linear regression models did not show any influence of gestational age group or VLBW status on the MES (all p > 0.5).We found no consistent differences between adults born early or late preterm and those born at term in circadian preference. The earlier circadian preference previously observed in those born smallest is unlikely to extend across the whole range of preterm birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Prokineticins are involved in many physiological processes including circadian rhythms, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and cancer. Recently, they have been found to play a role in regulating food intake. Historically, proteins that increase feeding behavior in mammals decrease reproductive behavior to prevent pregnancy and lactation when food is scarce. In the current study, prokineticin-2 (PK2) had pronounced effects on reproductive and ingestive behaviors when given to female Syrian hamsters. Administration of PK2 prevented ingestive behaviors induced by food restriction, such as the amount of time spent with food and eating. Hamsters given PK2 preferred to engage in reproductive behaviors, including spending time with a male and lordosis. Furthermore, analysis of blood plasma revealed that changes to behavior persisted despite similar levels of des-acyl ghrelin (DAG) and reduced glucose concentrations in the blood. Additionally, administering 10 mg/kg of acyl ghrelin (AG) to a different cohort of animals significantly decreased the amount of time females spent with a potential mating partner, increased the amount of time females spent with food, decreased the duration of lordosis, and increased the duration of eating. Results from the current study support the need for further research investigating the reproductive and ingestive roles of PK2 and ghrelin.

AB  - Women's sleep quality has been reported to change during pregnancy; prevalence estimates of poor sleep quality during pregnancy vary widely. To further understand the observed variation of findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Articles (N = 24) that reported prevalence of poor sleep quality as captured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) ≥ 5 were included, with a total of 11,002 participants contributing data. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched. Results indicated that the average PSQI score during pregnancy was 6.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.30, 6.85], and 45.7%, 95% CI [36.5%, 55.2%], of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality. Longitudinal studies indicated that sleep quality decreased from second (M = 5.31, SE = 0.40) to third trimester (M = 7.03, SE = 0.85) by 1.68 points, 95% CI [0.42, 2.94]. Gestational age moderated the average PSQI scores and prevalence of PSQI scores ≥5; older samples reported higher mean PSQI scores and higher prevalence of poor sleep quality. Clinicians should be aware that some reduction in sleep quality is expected during pregnancy, but complaints of very poor sleep quality could require intervention. Future research should examine various factors underlying poor sleep quality during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

However, studies among pregnant women are sparse, conflicting, and none have been conducted among Hispanic women, who face a disproportionate burden of poor sleep and pregnancy complications. Therefore, our objective was to examine the relationship between intensity- and domain-specific PA, respectively, on sleep quality and duration among Hispanic pregnant women. Participants: We evaluated these associations among participants (n = 251) in Estudio PARTO, an ongoing randomized controlled trial aimed at reducing type 2 diabetes among women at high risk. Methods: We assessed the cross-sectional relationship between PA (via Pregnancy PA Questionnaire) and sleep quality and duration (via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) using baseline data (26.5 ± 6.9 weeks gestation). Results: In multivariable logistic models, household and caregiving activities were associated with higher odds of very poor sleep quality (OR = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.04 to 7.04) and with short (vs. medium) sleep duration (OR = 2.85; 95% CI = 1.07 to 7.56). In contrast, occupational PA was associated with lower odds of very poor sleep quality (OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.89). Light-intensity PA was associated with lower odds of long (vs. medium) sleep duration (OR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.52). There were no statistically significant relationships between PA in any other domain and sleep. Conclusions: Prospective studies will be critical in evaluating the potential adverse impact of household and caregiving activities on poor sleep quality.

AB  - This was a retrospective case–control study in 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy and 75 women in the control group. Patients completed the questionnaire by Maurovich‐Horvat et al. (J. Sleep Res., 2013, 22: 496–512). We personally interviewed 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy using the administered questionnaire regarding conception, pregnancy, delivery, perinatal and breastfeeding periods. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy reported 59 pregnancies versus 164 in the control group. In 16 cases (27.1%), a disease before pregnancy was present compared with eight cases (4.9%) in the control group (P P P P P P P < 0.01). Modafinil and methylphenidate were the drugs administered in six pregnancies. No significant differences in depression during pregnancy and during puerperium were found between patients and controls. This is the first case–control study in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy related to pregnancy, delivery, childbirth and puerperium. Data suggest that patients have pregnancy outcomes similar to controls. The prevalence of gestational diabetes was higher in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Caesarean sections, complications during delivery and normal perinatal period for infants were similar in both groups. Breastfeeding was longer in patients.

AB  - Pregnant women have more sleep problems compared to non-pregnant women. Our objective was to investigate the differences in sleep patterns by age among Japanese women enrolled in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study during preconception and pregnancy. Questionnaires on sleep status were administered to pregnant women twice in the first, second and/or third trimesters. Wake-up time, bedtime, sleep duration and quality of sleep were analyzed in 103,099 respondents. Women younger than 20 years of age awoke and slept the latest in comparison to all other age groups during preconception and pregnancy. Sleep time of women younger than 20 years of age was the longest in comparison to other age groups. The wake-up time and bedtime of teenage mothers were delayed from preconception to second or third trimester, but they did not display any statistically significant changes in other age groups. Moreover, the younger the pregnant women were the more sleep trouble they had despite reportedly being tired, and felt more sleep-deprived despite having had enough sleep time in both second and third trimesters. The sleep state of pregnant women differed by age, with younger women experiencing more sleep trouble and feeling less rested compared to other groups. In future studies, the influences of sleep during pregnancy on the health and development of the children of these pregnant women will be clarified.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze relationships among general health, coping style, and perceived stress in healthy primigravida pregnant women. A cross-sectional study was conducted at public health clinics in Hamadan city, Iran between July and December 2015. In total, 380 pregnant women were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory and General Health Questionnaire. Perceived stress was assessed through an interview comprised of open-ended questions. The final PATH model fit well; general health (β = 0.02) as well as anxiety and sleep disorders (β = 0.03) were slightly directly associated with perceived stress, and only planning–preparation was related to perceived stress through general health (β = 0.09). The findings enhance the knowledge gained from previous perinatal stress research. General health status was directly related to stress, and coping style was indirectly related to stress. Coping styles may mediate the relationship between general health status and perceived stress, suggesting that midwives should attempt to improve the general health of women to reduce stress and its consequences during pregnancy by teaching patients appropriate coping styles. Further studies on the effect of coping style interventions on stress are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Psychoneuroendocrinology
AB  - Introduction: Compared to women who have given birth before (i.e., multiparas), those giving birth for the first time (i.e., primiparas) show higher cortisol levels. Psychological factors may play a role; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation is a well-described stress response. Primiparity also predicts greater risk for postpartum depression, which may be related to greater correspondence between cortisol and mood following prenatal cortisol elevations. The current study examined associations among parity, perinatal cortisol adaptation, pregnancy-specific distress, and postpartum mood. Methods: This longitudinal study assayed serum cortisol levels among 137 women at early, mid-, and late pregnancy and postpartum. Pregnancy-specific distress and depressive symptoms were assessed. Maternal age, race, body mass index, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and sampling time of day were statistically controlled. Results: Primiparous women showed higher cortisol levels than multiparous women during mid- (χ² = 11.8, p p p ab = 1.0, 95%CI [0.05, 2.9]). Prenatal cortisol (per AUC) did not predict postpartum depressive symptoms (b* = 0.03, p = 0.81), with no difference by parity (b* = 0.03, p = 0.91). At postpartum, a significant interaction between parity and cortisol (b* = 0.40, p = 0.03) revealed no significant association between cortisol and mood among multiparas (b* = −0.11, p = 0.28) but a trend toward a positive association among primiparas (b* = 0.24, p = 0.06). Discussion: Cortisol levels and pregnancy-specific distress are higher in primiparas versus multiparas, with pregnancy-specific distress partially mediating the association between parity and cortisol levels. Cortisol levels and mood display correspondence at postpartum in primiparous but not multiparous women. While observational studies must be interpreted with caution due to potential unmeasured confounders, these findings suggest that future studies examining mechanisms underlying perinatal and postpartum hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal perturbations and designing interventions aimed at preventing related complications should carefully consider potential differences by parity.

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Pregnancy and lactation are metabolically challenging states, where the mother must supply all the energy requirements for the developing fetus and growing pups respectively. The aim of the current study was to characterize many aspects of energy homeostasis before and during pregnancy in the mouse, and to examine the role of voluntary activity on changes in energy expenditure during pregnancy. In a secondary aim, we evaluate measures of energy homeostasis during pregnancy in mice that successfully reared their litter or in mice that went on to abandon their litter, to determine if an impairment in pregnancy-induced adaptation of energy homeostasis might underlie the abandonment of pups soon after birth. During pregnancy, food intake was increased, characterized by increased meal size and duration but not number of meals per day. The duration of time spent inactive, predicted to indicate sleep behaviour, was increased both early and late in pregnancy compared to pre-pregnancy levels. Increased x + y beam breaks, as a measure of activity increased during pregnancy and this reflected an increase in ambulatory behaviour in mid pregnancy and an increase in non-ambulatory movement in late pregnancy. Energy expenditure, as measured by indirect calorimetry, increased across pregnancy, likely due to the growth and development of fetal tissue. There was also a dramatic reduction in voluntary wheel running as soon as the mice became pregnant. Compared with successful pregnancies and lactations, pregnancies where pups were abandoned soon after birth were associated with reduced body weight gain and an increase in running wheel activity at the end of pregnancy, but no difference in food intake or energy expenditure. Overall, during pregnancy there are multiple adaptations to change energy homeostasis, resulting in partitioning of provisions of energy to the developing fetus and storing energy for future metabolic demands.

T2  - Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care
AB  - Background Late stillbirth, which occurs ≥28 weeks’ gestation, affects 1.3‐8.8 per 1000 births in high‐income countries. Of concern, most occur in women without established risk factors. Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors that relate to maternal behaviors remains a priority in stillbirth prevention research. This study aimed to investigate, in an international cohort, whether maternal sleep practices are related to late stillbirth. Methods An Internet‐based case‐control study of women who had a stillbirth ≥28 weeks’ gestation within 30 days before completing the survey (n = 153) and women with an ongoing third‐trimester pregnancy or who had delivered a live born child within 30 days (n = 480). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR and aOR, respectively) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for stillbirth. Results Sleeping >9 hours per night in the previous month was associated with stillbirth (aOR 1.75 [95% CI 1.10‐2.79]), as was waking on the right side (2.27 [1.31‐3.92]). Nonrestless sleep in the last month was also found to be associated with stillbirth (1.73 [1.03‐2.99]), with good sleep quality in the last month approaching significance (1.64 [0.98‐2.75]). On the last night of pregnancy, not waking more than one time was associated with stillbirth (2.03 [1.24‐3.34]). No relationship was found with going to sleep position during pregnancy, although very few women reported settling in the supine position (2.4%). Conclusions Long periods of undisturbed sleep are associated with late stillbirth. Physiological studies of how the neuroendocrine and autonomic system pathways are regulated during sleep in the context of late pregnancy are warranted.

AB  - Animal studies strongly suggest that timed feeding can have beneficial physiological effects, including protection against the obesogenic and metabolic consequences of a high-fat diet. However, the relationship between variables related to the timing of eating and diet quality in pregnancy women, which is considered as a period of nutritional vulnerability, is still poorly described in the literature. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet quality of pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 100 pregnant women in the first gestational trimester (≤12 weeks of gestation). The information regarding food intake was obtained by three 24-Hour Dietary Recall (24HR). Time-related eating patterns, i.e., the interval between the first and the last meal (eating duration), nightly fasting, time of the first and last meals, and number of meals eating on a day were determined. Chronotype was derived using the mid-sleep time on free days on weekends, with a further correction for calculated sleep debt. Diet quality was evaluated using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index-Revised (BHEI-R), validated for the Brazilian population. Linear regression modeling analyses adjusted for confounders were used to investigate the association between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet quality. The BHEI-R total score was negatively associated with time of the first meal (β = −0.355; p = 0.002; r2 adjusted = 0.141), and positively associated with eating duration (β = 0.262; p = 0.024; r2 adjusted = 0.086) and number of meals (β = 0.273; p = 0.019; r2 adjusted = 0.091). In addition, the score of total fruit component was negatively associated with chronotype (β = −0.236; p = 0.033; r2 adjusted = 0.078), time of the first meal (β = −0.393; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.171), and positively associated with eating duration (β = 0.259; p = 0.022; r2 adjusted = 0.087) and number of meals (β = 0.376; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.159). The score for whole fruit component was negatively associated with time of the first meal (β = −0.388; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.152), and positively associated with number of meals (β = 0.403; p = 0.001; r2 adjusted = 0.164). A longer eating duration, earlier time of the first meal, higher number of meals and morningness tendency are associated with a better diet quality in the first gestational trimester – higher scores of the total BHEI-R and/or fruit components. We suggest that nutritional guidelines should consider time-related eating patterns and chronotype to ensure good diet quality of pregnant women since the beginning of gestation, contributing on prevention of metabolic-nutritional complications.

AB  - Aims: We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time. Methods: The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income, minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child age. Results: Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later. Conclusions: Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome has been associated with serum iron deficiency in clinical studies. However, studies investigating this relationship have had inconsistent results and there are no studies in young adults. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum measures of iron stores and restless legs syndrome in young adults in the community. Participants in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study answered questions on restless legs syndrome (n = 1,100, 54% female) at age 22 years, and provided serum measures of iron stores (ferritin and transferrin saturation) at ages 17 and 22 years. Restless legs syndrome was diagnosed when four International RLS Study Group criteria were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening during evening/night) and these symptoms occurred ≥5 times per month. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between serum iron stores and restless legs syndrome, adjusting for potential confounders. The prevalence of restless legs syndrome at age 22 years was 3.0% (n = 33, 70% female). Among those who provided restless legs syndrome and iron data at age 22 years (n = 865), the median (interquartile range) ferritin was not different between the restless legs syndrome (55 [29.5–103.5] µg L−1) and the non‐restless legs syndrome group (65.0 [35.0–103.3] µg L−1, p = 0.2), nor were there differences in iron deficiency prevalence (p = 0.36). There was no association between restless legs syndrome (22 years) and iron stores (17, 22 years) before or after adjustment for potential confounders. There was no association between restless legs syndrome at 22 years and iron stores at 17 or 22 years in this cohort. Serum iron stores may not be a useful indicator of restless legs syndrome risk in young adults in the community. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this secondary analysis was to determine whether seasonal light exposure, categorized by type of day length, is associated with or predictive of depressive symptoms in late pregnancy and the first 3 months postpartum. Women (n = 279) expecting their first child were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth education classes. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Day lengths were categorized into short, lengthening, long and shortening. Data analysis included linear mixed models and multiple linear regression. When days were shortening (August to first 4 days of November) in late third trimester, depressive symptom scores were highest (35%) and continued to be higher at each postpartum assessment compared to other day length categories. Implications for clinical practice include increased vigilance for depressive symptoms, particularly if late pregnancy and birth occurs during the 3 months around the Autumn equinox when day length is shortening. Strategies that increase light exposure in late pregnancy and postpartum should also be considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy
AB  - Background: Unwanted, intrusive thoughts of infant-related harm are a normal, albeit distressing experience for most new mothers. The occurrence of these thoughts can represent a risk factor for the development of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). As the early postpartum period represents a time of increased risk for OCD development, the transition to parenthood provides a unique opportunity to better understand OCD development. Aims: The purpose of this study was to assess components of cognitive behavioural conceptualizations of postpartum OCD in relation to new mothers’ thoughts of infant-related harm. Method: English-speaking pregnant women (n = 100) participated. Questionnaires were completed at approximately 36 weeks of gestation, and at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum. An interview to assess postpartum harm thoughts was administered at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires assessed OC symptoms, OC-related beliefs, fatigue, sleep difficulties and negative mood. Results: Prenatal OC-related beliefs predicted postpartum OC symptoms, as well as harm thought characteristics and behavioural responses to harm thoughts. The severity of behavioural responses to early postpartum harm thoughts did not predict later postpartum OC symptoms, but did predict frequency and time occupation of accidental harm thoughts, and interference in parenting by intentional harm thoughts. Strong relationships between OC symptoms and harm thought characteristics, and concurrent sleep difficulties, negative mood and fatigue were also found. Conclusions: Findings provide support for cognitive behavioural conceptualizations of postpartum OCD and emphasize the importance of maternal sleep, fatigue and negative mood in the relationship between OC-related beliefs and maternal cognitive and behavioural responses to postpartum harm thoughts.

T2  - Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology
AB  - Objective: This systematic review explores changes in perinatal empathy and influence on maternal behaviours and child development.Background: The well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers’ capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may disrupt empathic processing.Methods: Original research papers (n = 7413) published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking. Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria.Results: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of children and was partially explained by mothers’ aversive response to infant crying.Conclusion: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based, incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.

AB  - Sleep problems in young children are among the most common concerns reported to paediatricians. Sleep is thought to have important regulatory functions, and sleep difficulties in early childhood are linked to several psychosocial and physiological problems. Moreover, several prenatal factors have been found to influence infants’ sleep. Among them, most of the studies have been focused on maternal prenatal depression and/or anxiety as potential risk factors for sleep problems in childhood, whereas other relevant psychological factors during pregnancy have not received as much attention. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effect of several psychiatric maternal risk factors during pregnancy (i.e. symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, alcohol use, seasonality, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and/or stressful life events) on the onset of some sleep problems related to sleep quality and sleep practices in 3‐month‐old infants. We examined 1,221 cases from a population‐based birth cohort, with subjective measures during pregnancy in mothers, and at 3 months after birth in the infants. The findings showed that all the maternal risk factors during pregnancy, except for symptoms of alcoholism and sleepiness, were related to sleep difficulties in infants. Interestingly, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptomatology in mothers during pregnancy was the only variable that predicted more than two sleeping difficulties (i.e. long sleep‐onset latency, co‐sleeping with parents and irregular sleeping routines) at 3 months old. Our results highlight the relevance of maternal risk factors during pregnancy, and not only prenatal depression and/or anxiety, as variables to be considered when examining sleep difficulties in infants.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of certified nurse‐midwives related to sudden infant death syndrome and infant safe sleep. However, this population is an important and trusted source of information for pregnant women and may provide guidance on infant care. We explored these topics with certified nurse‐midwives to identify potential barriers as well as enabling and reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal health care environment. Methods: Participants in this cross‐sectional survey study were certified nurse‐midwives who provide prenatal health care to women in Ohio. Surveys were mailed to all certified nurse‐midwives listed with the licensing registry of the Ohio Board of Nursing (N = 333). Results: A total of 153 eligible respondents completed the survey for a response rate of 55%. Most participants had at least some knowledge of the infant safe sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and two‐thirds had positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. Many participants (61%) perceived that there were barriers to providing prenatal infant safe sleep education, but nearly all (94%) indicated that they were interested in providing this education to their patients. Positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education were predictive of whether they discussed this topic with their patients. Discussion: Certified nurse‐midwives routinely provide guidance on infant care, and it is important that they are familiar with current evidence‐based recommendations on infant safe sleep. They should be supported in their desire to provide infant safe sleep education to their prenatal patients. In addition, efforts should be made to improve attitudes and social norms related to providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment.

AB  - Whether or not childhood sleep problems and anxiety occur simultaneously, or one precedes the other, and any effect of autistic traits on this relationship remains unclear. We investigated longitudinal associations between sleep and anxiety at 2 years and sleep and anxiety at 8 years controlling for demographic variables. We also examined the additional influence of autistic traits at 2 years on sleep problems and anxiety at 8 years. Participants were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, where 2900 pregnant women were recruited between 1989 and 1991 and their children assessed every 2–3 years thereafter. Demographic information was provided at 16–18 weeks gestation. Children’s sleep and anxiety at 2 and 8 years and autistic traits at 2 years were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist. Hierarchical multiple regression models tested the prediction of both anxiety and sleep problems at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 years and 8 years, anxiety at 2 years, and autistic traits at 2 years were significantly associated with anxiety at 8 years. Sleep problems at 2 years and anxiety at 8 years were significantly related to sleep problems at 8 years. Each of these models explained about 20% of variance. Childhood sleep problems, anxiety and autistic traits are interrelated and can occur concurrently in young children, but the best predictor of poor sleep in middle childhood is concurrent anxiety and vice versa. Anxiety and sleep problems may be an early indicator of autism in young children and early autistic traits may also contribute to anxiety problems later in childhood.

T2  - Sleep Medicine Reviews
AB  - Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; 15–20% of obese pregnant women have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea increases along with body mass index, age and in the presence of other co-morbidities. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea in women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities; recent studies suggest that women with obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy may be at significantly greater risk of entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension and/or of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: gestational hypertension; preeclampsia; or eclampsia. This has serious public health implications; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and are associated with a greater lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms that associated obstructive sleep apnea with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not been defined, but several pathways are scientifically plausible. In this review, we will present a comprehensive literature review of the following: the associations between obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the proposed mechanisms that may connect obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and the effectiveness of treatment at mitigating these adverse outcomes.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbance and fatigue are frequent complaints during pregnancy and postpartum. We assessed the effectiveness of Lavender cream and footbath on sleep quality and fatigue in pregnancy and postpartum.Methods: In this trial, 141 women with sleep disturbance at 25–28 weeks gestation were recruited from public health centers in Tabriz, Iran, from May 2013 until January 2014 and randomized into one of three groups receiving: Lavender and footbath, Lavender alone, or placebo cream. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index at the 4th and 8th weeks after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional assessment of fatigue scale at the 6th week after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA were used.Results: Compared with the placebo group, the global sleep quality score post-intervention in pregnancy and the postpartum were significantly lower in the Lavender and footbath and the Lavender cream only groups. Fatigue in both intervention groups was significantly improved only at the 6th week postpartum. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two intervention groups.Conclusion: Lavender cream with or without footbath may improve sleep quality in pregnancy and postpartum.

AB  - Objective: This paper will describe the development of a programme of SMS messages including parenting information and support to be sent to the mobile phones of mothers with severe mental illness (SMI) and their partners from early pregnancy to 24 weeks post birth. Method: Text messages (total 176) designed and tested for fathers (SMS4Dads) addressing father-infant attachment, co-parenting and self-care (including Mood Tracker texts asking fathers to rate their mood) were adapted by an expert advisory group of clinicians with experience across perinatal mental health services. Messages were rated on importance, clarity, acceptability (separately for mothers and fathers) and being consistent with current evidence. Additional messages were developed specifically for this population and all messages were tested for literacy level. The SMS4dads ‘Mood Tracker’ was redesigned to address common stress-inducing parenting issues such as infant crying, lack of sleep, and self-doubt about capacity to parent with an escalation process in cases of significant distress. Results: Separate protocol tested text-message banks for mothers (141 messages), and fathers (141 messages) were developed. Fourteen Mood Tracker topics were developed with two levels of distress escalation linked to local mental health services. Discussion: The need for accurate descriptions of health interventions processes is widely recognised, particularly in the case of digital mental health. This study provides a detailed description of the adaptive design by clinicians and researchers of brief text messages suitable for mothers with severe mental illness and their partners.

AB  - Background: The main aim of this study was to examine the prospective impact of maternal postpartum PTSD on several standardized child sleep variables two years postpartum in a large, population-based cohort of mothers. Moreover, we investigated the influence of numerous potential confounding maternal and child factors. Finally, we tested potential reverse temporal associations between child sleep eight weeks postpartum and maternal PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Methods: This study is part of the population-based Akershus Birth Cohort, a prospective cohort study at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Data from the hospital's birth record, from questionnaires at 17 weeks gestation, eight weeks and two years postpartum were used. At two years postpartum, 39% of the original participants could be retained, resulting in a study population of n = 1480. All child sleep variables significantly correlated with postpartum PTSD symptoms were entered into multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors. Results: : Postpartum PTSD symptoms were related to all child sleep variables, except daytime sleep duration. When all significant confounding factors were included into multivariate regression analyses, postpartum PTSD symptoms remained a significant predictor for number and duration of night wakings (β = 0.10 and β = 0.08, respectively), duration of settling time (β = 0.10), and maternal rating of their child's sleep problems (β = 0.12, all p < .01. Child sleep at eight weeks postpartum was not significantly related to maternal sleep two years postpartum when controlling for postpartum PTSD at eight weeks. Limitations: Child outcomes were based on maternal reporting and might be influenced by maternal mental health. Conclusions: Our results showed for the first time that maternal postpartum PTSD symptoms were prospectively associated with less favorable child sleep, thus increasing the risk of developmental or behavioral problems through an indirect, but treatable pathway. Early detection and treatment of maternal postpartum PTSD may prevent or improve sleep problems and long-term child development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and symptoms of depression and anxiety in women studied in pregnancy and postpartum. Scores on standardized measures of sleep (PSQI) at 6 months postpartum, and symptoms of anxiety and depression (OASIS, the PHQ9, and EPDS) were assessed by structured interviews in 116 women in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women who had significantly higher OASIS (anxiety) scores (β = .530, p p p < .001) also had elevated total PSQI scores after adjustment for covariates, including prenatal depression and anxiety scores. Though inferences about causality are not feasible, these results support emerging research showing sleep quality is a risk factor for negative maternal affect in the postpartum period. Assessment of maternal sleep hygiene is worth consideration as a component of identifying women at risk for postpartum depression and anxiety.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this paper was to examine the role of perinatal, obstetric and post-partum factors on maternal and paternal stress. It will present the first examination of the role of prenatal, obstetric, post-partum, and demographic variables in parenting stress for mothers and fathers at 9 months. Methods: Data from 6821 parental dyads of 9-month-old infants were extracted from the Growing Up in Ireland National Longitudinal Study of Children. Participants completed the Parental Stress Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Quality of Attachment Sub-scale from the Maternal and Paternal Postnatal Attachment Scales, and a single item health status question from the Short Form 12 Health Survey. Information on prenatal care, pregnancy complications, obstetric outcomes, infant health, and participant demographics were also collected. Separate hierarchical linear regressions were conducted for mothers and fathers Results: Mothers reported higher levels of parenting stress than fathers (p < 0.001). Maternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment, own health status, average sleep, occupation, household income, and having a very rapid labor. Paternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment and own health status. Discussion: A range of perinatal factors was associated with an increased risk of higher parenting stress at 9 months post-partum and the roles of these factors differ between mothers and fathers. These findings are important for predicting and reducing risk of parenting stress in both genders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Circadian rhythmicity is fundamental to human physiology, and is present even during fetal life in normal pregnancies. The impact of maternal endocrine disease on the fetal circadian rhythm is not well understood. The present study aimed to determine the fetal circadian rhythm in pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM), compare it with a low-risk reference population, and identify the effects of maternal glycemic control and morning cortisol concentrations. Long-term fetal electrocardiogram recordings were made in 40 women with PGDM at 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. Two recordings were made in 18 of the women (45.0%) and one recording was made in 22 (55.0%). The mean fetal heart rate (fHR) and the fHR variation (root mean square of squared differences) were extracted in 1-min epochs, and circadian rhythmicity was detected by cosinor analysis. The study cohort was divided based on HbA1c levels and morning cortisol concentrations. Statistically, significant circadian rhythms in the fHR and the fHR variation were found in 45 (100%) and 44 (95.7%) of the 45 acceptable PGDM recordings, respectively. The rhythms were similar to those of the reference population. However, there was no statistically significant population-mean rhythm in the fHR among PGDM pregnancies at 36 weeks, indicating an increased interindividual variation. The group with higher HbA1c levels (>6.0%) had no significant population-mean fHR rhythm at 28 or 36 weeks, and no significant fHR-variation rhythm at 36 weeks. Similarly, the group with a lower morning cortisol concentration (≤8.8 µg/dl) had no significant population-mean fHR-variation rhythm at 28 and 36 weeks. These findings indicate that individual fetal rhythmicity is present in pregnancies complicated by PGDM. However, suboptimal maternal glycemic control and a lower maternal morning cortisol concentration are associated with a less-well-synchronized circadian system of the fetus.

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: Both perinatal depression and infant sleep problems are common concerns in many communities, with these problems often coinciding. Findings in this area conflict and much of the research relies on poor measures of sleep and/or depression. Adding to this complexity is the rise in antidepressant treatment for perinatal maternal depression and no previous study has examined the relationship between such exposure and infant sleep. Methods: This study draws on four waves of data (early pregnancy and third trimester, and six and 12 months postpartum) from 264 women in the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort study of women recruited in early pregnancy in Melbourne, Australia. Cross-lagged regression models were used to examine reciprocity of longitudinal effects between depressive symptoms and infant sleep. Results: Maternal antepartum depression and antidepressant use were not significant predictors of infant sleep problems. Likewise, infant sleep problems were not significant predictors of postpartum maternal depression. However, maternal cognitions about infant sleep, characterised by maternal expectations to immediately attend to their crying child, did demonstrate positive reciprocal effects with infant nocturnal waking between six and 12 months postpartum. Limitations: Infant sleep outcomes were reported by the mother and the sample were predominantly Anglophone, restricting generalizability of the models to other cultures. Conclusions: Maternal depression and antidepressant use were not found to be significant factors in infant sleep problems and, likewise, infant sleep problems were not associated with maternal depression. However, postpartum maternal cognitions around six months postpartum regarding limit-setting at night may predict increases in later nocturnal infant signaling.

AB  - Background: Even though more than 20% of women meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, very little is known about the predictors of these problems. As a result, we systematically reviewed the literature on risk factors for new onset anxiety and maternal anxiety exacerbation in the perinatal period. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ovid, ProQuest Portal, and Web of Science were searched for studies assessing risk factors for the development of new onset anxiety or anxiety worsening in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Results: 11,759 citations were identified, with 11 studies meeting eligibility criteria. New onset anxiety was assessed in 7 studies, anxiety worsening in 3, and 1 assessed both. Lower educational attainment, living with extended family members, multiparity, a family history of psychiatric disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum, comorbid sleep disorders, and prenatal oxytocin exposure were risk factors for new onset perinatal anxiety, while presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and prenatal oxytocin were risk factors for anxiety worsening. Limitations: Studies not explicitly stating whether participants had pre-existing anxiety disorders were excluded. As a result, meta-analysis was not possible for several risk factors. Conclusions: Risk factors for new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening during the perinatal period include psychological, social, and biological exposures. Given the lack of studies differentiating women with and without pre-existing anxiety disorders, additional research is required in order to determine whether these factors differ from the non-puerperal population, as well as from each other.

AB  - Objectives: The prevalence of RLS in pregnancy is higher when compared with the general population however it remains unknown among indigenous black Africans. Available data indicate that RLS is uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa. We embarked on this study to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in an antenatal clinic sample of Nigerian pregnant women compared with a primary care sample of non-pregnant women. Methods: A total of 310 pregnant women and non-pregnant women filled out a questionnaire which incorporated the 2014 minimal criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Demographic and clinical data, including sleep duration and samples for blood hemoglobin concentration and urinalysis were obtained. Results: The mean ages of the pregnant and non-pregnant women were 24.9 ± 5.6 years and 23.6 + 5.4 years, respectively (p = 0.003). There was no case of RLS found among pregnant women while five (1.6%) of the non-pregnant women fulfilled the criteria for RLS. Overall, the prevalence report of RLS symptoms was associated with lower mean habitual nocturnal sleep duration (p < 0.05) coffee (p = 0.013) and kola nut (0.023) consumption, report of leg cramps (p < 0.001) and proteinuria (p = 0.047), Report of leg cramps and proteinuria were independently associated with RLS. Conclusion: The prevalence of restless legs syndrome is low among women of child-bearing age in the Nigerian population and may be lower in pregnancy. Report of leg cramps and proteinuria are independently associated with RLS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the general population, sleeping problems can precede an episode of depression. We hypothesized that sleeping problems during pregnancy, including insomnia symptoms, shortened sleep, and daytime tiredness, are related to maternal postnatal depressiveness. We conducted a prospective study evaluating sleep and depressive symptoms, both prenatally (around gestational week 32) and postnatally (around 3 months after delivery) in the longitudinal CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort in Finland. Prenatally, 1667 women returned the questionnaire, of which 1398 women participated also at the postnatal follow-up. Sleep was measured with the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ) and depressive symptoms with a 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Altogether, 10.3% of the women had postnatal depressiveness (CES-D ≥ 10 points). After adjusting for main background characteristics and prenatal depressiveness (CES-D ≥ 10), poor general sleep quality (AOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.21–2.88), tiredness during the day (AOR 2.19, 95% CI 1.41–3.38), short sleep ≤ 6 and ≤ 7 h, sleep latency > 20 min, and sleep loss ≥ 2 h were associated with postnatal depressiveness (all p < .050). Postnatally, after the adjustment for background characteristics, virtually all sleeping problems (i.e., difficulty falling asleep (AOR 7.93, 95% CI 4.76–13.20)), except frequent night awakenings per week or severe sleepiness during the day, were related to concurrent postnatal depressiveness. Thus, several prenatal and postnatal sleeping problems are associated with increased depressive symptoms 3 months postnatally. Screening of maternal prenatal sleeping problems, even without depressive symptoms during pregnancy or lifetime, would help to identify women at an increased risk for postnatal depressiveness.

AB  - Maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) has been suggested to be associated with increased frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in both humans and animal models. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is still unclear. We have recently reported that MSD at different stages of pregnancy impairs the emotional and cognitive functions, and suppresses hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) in the offspring rats. Here, we report that the MSD induced LTP impairment at the CA1 hippocampus of the offspring rats is associated with increased long-term depression (LTD) and reduced expression of postsynaptic GluA2-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Importantly, we found that inhibition of AMPAR endocytosis by a synthetic peptide Tat-GluA23Y (3 μmol/kg, i.p.) not only increased level of AMPARs and reduced LTD, but also restored LTP. Moreover, treatment with Tat-GluA23Y peptide markedly alleviated the MSD-induced impairments of spatial learning and memory; and decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in the offspring. Together, our findings suggest that the MSD-induced postsynaptic AMPAR endocytosis causally contributes to the impairments of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, thereby disrupting the emotional and cognitive functions in the offspring.

AB  - Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is an emerging concern, as it can adversely affect the development of the offspring brain. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of deprivation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the third term of pregnancy on the sleep–wake profiles of neonates in the Wistar rat model. Sleep–wake patterns were assessed through electrophysiological measures and behavioural observations during postnatal days 1–21 on pups born to REM sleep‐deprived dams and control rats. Pups of REM sleep‐deprived dams had active sleep that was not only markedly higher in percentage during all the days studied, but also had reduced latency during later postnatal days 15–21. Quiet sleep and wake periods were lower. These factors, along with less frequent but longer sleep–wake cycles, indicated maturational delay in the sleep–wake neural networks. The disruption of time‐bound growth of sleep–wake neural networks was substantiated further by the decreased slope of survival plots in the sleep bouts. Examination of altered sleep–wake patterns during early development may provide crucial information concerning deranged neural development in the offspring. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to show that maternal sleep deprivation during pregnancy can delay and impair the development of sleep–wake profile in the offspring.

The original article has been corrected.] Introduction Although home-visiting programs typically engage families during pregnancy, few studies have examined maternal and child health outcomes during the antenatal and newborn period and fewer have demonstrated intervention impacts. Illinois has developed an innovative model in which programs utilizing evidence-based home-visiting models incorporate community doulas who focus on childbirth education, breastfeeding, pregnancy health, and newborn care. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the impact of doula-home-visiting on birth outcomes, postpartum maternal and infant health, and newborn care practices. Methods 312 young (M = 18.4 years), pregnant women across four communities were randomly assigned to receive doula-home-visiting services or case management. Women were African American (45%), Latina (38%), white (8%), and multiracial/other (9%). They were interviewed during pregnancy and at 3-weeks and 3-months postpartum. Results Intervention-group mothers were more likely to attend childbirth-preparation classes (50 vs. 10%, OR = 9.82, p < .01), but there were no differences on Caesarean delivery, birthweight, prematurity, or postpartum depression. Intervention-group mothers were less likely to use epidural/pain medication during labor (72 vs. 83%; OR = 0.49, p < .01) and more likely to initiate breastfeeding (81 vs. 74%; OR = 1.72, p < .05), although the breastfeeding impact was not sustained over time. Intervention-group mothers were more likely to put infants on their backs to sleep (70 vs. 61%; OR = 1.64, p < .05) and utilize car-seats at three weeks (97 vs. 93%; OR = 3.16, p < .05). Conclusions for practices The doula-home-visiting intervention was associated with positive infant-care behaviors. Since few evidence-based home-visiting programs have shown health impacts in the postpartum months after birth, incorporating doula services may confer additional health benefits to families.

AB  - Study Objectives: In humans and other mammals, sleep is altered during pregnancy. However, no studies have been conducted on sleep/wakefulness during pregnancy in mice. In this study, we examined sleep/wakefulness in female C57BL/6 mice during pregnancy. We also examined sleep/wake behaviors in an animal model of preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertensive (PAH) mice, in which increased angiotensin causes hypertension. Methods: Sleep/wake behaviors of female C57BL/6 and PAH mice were examined based on electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyogram recordings before, during, and after pregnancy. To examine whether high blood pressure disrupts the integrity of the blood–brain barrier in PAH mice, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (olmesartan)- administered PAH mice and female Tsukuba hypertensive mice were also examined. Results: C57BL/6 mice showed a decreased total wake time and increased nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time during late pregnancy. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time did not change during the course of pregnancy. PAH mice exhibited a general slowing of EEG during late pregnancy and subsequently returned to apparently normal sleep/wakefulness after delivery. All PAH mice exhibited multiple focal leakages of Evans blue dye in the brain. Spike-and-wave discharges were observed in 50% of PAH mice. Olmesartan-administered PAH mice did not show general slowing of EEG. Tsukuba hypertensive mice showed a normal time spent in wakefulness and NREM sleep and a decreased total REM sleep time. Conclusions: This study showed pregnant-stage-specific changes in sleep/wakefulness in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, PAH mice may be useful as an animal model for eclampsia.

AB  - Chronotype, or morningness/eveningness, has been associated with adjustment in both children and adolescents. Specifically, eveningness has been linked to adjustment difficulties; however, the mechanism underlying this association is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to test whether the associations between eveningness and adjustment difficulties could be explained by an unfavorable impact of eveningness on sleep. Links from chronotype to internalizing problems and problem behaviors via sleep quantity and sleep problems were tested in a sample from the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (N = 3485; 48.8% female), both when the participants were children (7 years at T1, 11 at T2) and when they were adolescents (15 years at T1, 18 at T2). The findings provided evidence that eveningness predicted greater sleep problems and lower sleep quantity; however, only sleep problems predicted internalizing problems and problem behaviors. Sleep quantity did not mediate the eveningness-adjustment link, and sleep problems did so only in children. The findings show that sleep problems appear to be more important in explaining the eveningness-adjustment link rather than altered sleep quantity, commonly associated with eveningness.

AB  - Obesity during pregnancy causes adverse maternal and fetal health outcomes and programs offspring for adult-onset diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Obesity also disrupts core body temperature (Tc) regulation in nonpregnant rodents; however, it is unknown whether obesity alters normal maternal Tc adaptations to pregnancy. Since Tc is influenced by the circadian system, and both obesity and pregnancy alter circadian biology, it was hypothesized that obesity disrupts the normal rhythmic patterns of Tc before and during gestation. Obesity was induced by cafeteria (CAF) feeding in female Wistar rats for 8 weeks prior to and during gestation, whereas control (CON) animals had free access to chow. Intraperitoneal temperature loggers measured daily Tc profiles throughout the study, while maternal body composition and leptin levels were assessed near term. Daily temperature profiles were examined for rhythmic features (mesor, amplitude and acrophase) by cosine regression analysis. CAF animals exhibited increased fat mass (93%) and associated hyperleptinemia (3.2-fold increase) compared to CON animals. CAF consumption reduced the average Tc (by up to 0.29°C) across the estrous cycle and most of pregnancy; however, Tc for CAF and CON animals converged toward the end of gestation. Obesity reduced the amplitude of Tc rhythms at estrus and proestrus and on day 8 of pregnancy, but increased the amplitude at day 20 of pregnancy. Photoperiod analysis revealed that obesity reduced Tc exclusively in the light period during pre-pregnancy but only during the dark period in late gestation. In conclusion, obesity alters rhythmic Tc profiles and reduces the magnitude of the Tc decline late in rat gestation, which may have implications for maternal health and fetal development.

AB  - Sleep‐disordered breathing is more common in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy; however, most studies have not adequately accounted for the potential confounding impact of obesity. This study evaluated the frequency of sleep‐disordered breathing in women with gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia compared with body mass index‐ and gestation‐matched normotensive pregnant women. Women diagnosed with gestational hypertension or pre‐eclampsia underwent polysomnography shortly after diagnosis. Normotensive controls body mass index‐matched within ± 4 kg m−2 underwent polysomnography within ±4 weeks of gestational age of their matched case. The mean body mass index and gestational age at polysomnography were successfully matched for 40 women with gestational hypertension/pre‐eclampsia and 40 controls. The frequency of sleep‐disordered breathing in the cases was 52.5% compared with 37.5% in the control group (P = 0.18), and the respiratory disturbance index overall did not differ (P = 0.20). However, more severe sleep‐disordered breathing was more than twice as common in women with gestational hypertension or pre‐eclampsia (35% versus 15%, P = 0.039). While more than half of women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy meet the clinical criteria for sleep‐disordered breathing, it is also very common in normotensive women of similar body mass index. This underscores the importance of adjusting for obesity when exploring the relationship between sleep‐disordered breathing and hypertension in pregnancy. More severe degrees of sleep‐disordered breathing are significantly associated with gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia, and sleep‐disordered breathing may plausibly play a role in the pathophysiology of pregnancy hypertension in these women. This suggests that more severe sleep‐disordered breathing is a potential therapeutic target for reducing the prevalence or severity of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

T2  - Frontiers in Psychology
AB  - In the literature, increasing evidence is showing the importance of sleep difficulties in the development or maintenance of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms as well as the association between childbirth-related PTS symptoms and early maternal emotions and perceptions of their children. However, little is known regarding the effects of maternal sleep difficulties on parenting or about the mediational role of childbirth-related PTS symptoms in this association. The present study (pregnancy: T0; 1 month postpartum: T1; 3 months postpartum: T2) had two aims. The first one was to explore whether maternal sleep difficulties could contribute to the maintenance of PTS symptoms and whether PTS symptoms could contribute to the maintenance of maternal sleep difficulties. The second purpose was to explore, at 3 months (T2), the associations among childbirth-related PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and the three dimensions of parenting stress [parental distress (PD), parent–child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child] by examining the mediational role of both maternal sleep difficulties and childbirth-related PTS symptoms. Self-report questionnaires were administered to 95 women at different times (T0, T1, and T2). Mediational results confirmed the bidirectional effects between maternal sleep difficulties and PTS symptoms and their reciprocal role of maintenance of symptoms. Moreover, at 3 months postpartum (T2), sleep difficulties mediated the association between PTS symptoms and the three dimensions of maternal parenting stress, while PTS symptoms mediated the associations among maternal sleep difficulties, PD, and difficult child dimensions of parenting stress. The study contributes to the understanding of the maintenance factors of childbirth-related PTS symptoms and of the relationships among PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and parenting stress.

T2  - Sleep and Biological Rhythms
AB  - Sleeping in the lateral position during pregnancy can potentially reduce the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). However, this hypothesis has not been formally investigated in pregnant women. Unlike previous studies that have relied largely on self-reported measures of sleeping position, we investigated the relationship between SDB and sleeping position during late pregnancy using objective measurements. Thirty pregnant women at the 37th gestational week and 30 non-pregnant women (n-Pr) participated in the present study. The pregnant women were divided into 2 groups: those with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m² (with obesity, p-Ob), and those with BMI P P P = 0.04). Moreover, there was a significant difference in RDI between p-Ob and p-nOb for the supine position (P = 0.001), but there was no between-group difference for the lateral position. Sleeping in the lateral position is likely to mitigate existing SDB in pregnant women with obesity in late pregnancy and may be an effective precaution against undiagnosed SDB and associated complications.

Findings are presented from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of the MIHOW model in a sample of Hispanic women in Tennessee. We hypothesized maternal and infant outcomes would be better in women assigned to MIHOW than women assigned to the minimal education intervention (MEI) group (receipt of educational materials). Methods Women entered the study during pregnancy (< 26 weeks gestation) and were followed through 6 months postpartum. A total of 188 women were enrolled and randomly assigned (MEI = 94; MIHOW = 94), with 178 women completing the study (MEI = 87; MIHOW = 91). Results Positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) effects of MIHOW were observed on breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, levels of depressive symptoms and parenting stress, safe sleep practices, and infant stimulation in the home. No statistically significant differences were noted in number of prenatal visits. Discussion Results expand limited empiric evidence and provide strong support of the effectiveness of MIHOW on improving health outcomes in this sample of Hispanic mothers and their infants. MIHOW is a viable option for providing culturally sensitive services to immigrant and underserved families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In “Long-term cerebral white and gray matter changes after preeclampsia,” the authors found that preeclampsia was associated with chronic temporal lobe white matter changes and reduced cortical volume in young women; the changes were consistent with persistent inflammation. Culebras proposes that sleep apnea may be a contributing factor as pregnancy increases the risk of sleep apnea, which leads to inflammation and vascular morbidities, all of which may persist after pregnancy. Siepmann et al. note that recent research shows an increased risk of stroke in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, possibly facilitated by intermittent hypoxia and vascular dysregulation. In “The autism ‘epidemic’: Ethical, legal, and social issues in a developmental spectrum disorder,” the authors emphasized the importance of early screening and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Machado et al. recommend assessing anatomic brain connectivity using the diffusion-weighted MRI technique and functional brain connectivity using EEG coherence calculations as part of the ASD diagnostic workup.

AB  - Comments on an article by Timo Siepmann et al. (see record 2017-14224-009). The article by Siepmann et al. identified long-term cerebral white matter changes and reduced cortical volume, presumably of vascular origin, in young women after pregnancy complicated bypreeclampsia. The authors invoked persistent inflammation as the putative agent. Sleep apnea may be a link among pregnancy, preeclampsia, and cerebrovascular disease. During the third trimester of pregnancy, the growth of the fetus restricts sleep respiratory function,particularly in obese women. Ten percent of pregnant women have sleep apnea, a condition that raises blood pressure, increases the level of inflammation, and leads topreeclampsia. Sleep apnea may persist after pregnancy, sustaining the post-preeclampsia vascular risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

Although obesity prevalence among some U.S. subpopulations appear to have stabilized, overall rates remain at historically high rates and racial/ethnic differences appear to be widening, particularly among Latino children. The elevated prevalence of overweight and obesity even among children ages 2-5 years has led to a growing recognition that risk factors in early life may be crucial to the development—and therefore the prevention—of obesity and its consequences. Epidemiological studies suggest that adverse exposures in pregnancy, such as intrauterine exposure to maternal smoking, excessive weight gain, or elevated glucose levels, and, in early childhood, rapid infant weight gain, poor feeding practices, too much television viewing, and short sleep duration, may increase short- and long-term risks for obesity and its sequelae. For these reasons, national reports emphasize the important role of early-life risk factors in obesity development and the need for interventions in early life to prevent obesity.

AB  - This review aims to evaluate the performance of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening questionnaires during pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using MEDLINE Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. A bivariate meta-analysis was applied for pooling of diagnostic parameters. Six of the total 4719 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ, N = 604) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, N = 420) were the most frequently used screening tools during pregnancy. The pooled prevalence of OSA during pregnancy was 26.7% (95%CI: 16.9%, 34.4%, I² = 83.15%). BQ performance was poor to fair with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95%CI: 0.45, 0.83; I² = 78.65%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I² = 81.55%), respectively. BQ performance was heterogeneous depending on type of reference test and pregnancy. Sensitivity increased if diagnosis was based on polysomnography (0.90), and respiratory disturbance index (0.90). However, sensitivity decreased if screening was performed in early pregnancy (≤20 weeks gestation: 0.47), and high-risk pregnancy (0.44). Performance of ESS was poor with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.44 (95%CI: 0.33, 0.56; I² = 32.8%) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.48, 0.75; I² = 81.55%), respectively. In conclusion, BQ and ESS showed poor performance during pregnancy, hence a new OSA screening questionnaire is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to reveal the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety among Chinese pregnant women. Pregnant women were recruited in Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort at Zhoushan Maternal and Child Care Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Self-rating depression scales (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scales (SAS) were used for evaluating depression and anxiety status at each trimester; corresponding sleep quality and duration were reported by pregnant women. Ordinary or multilevel linear and logistic regression model were used to estimate the cross-sectional or longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety. The prevalence rates were 35.64, 24.23, and 26.24% for depression and 22.57, 17.41, and 21.04% for anxiety at 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd trimester (T3), respectively. Controlling for potential confounders, it revealed significant cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of sleep with depression and anxiety status. In cross-sectional analysis, women who slept less than 8 h/day had higher risk of depression (T1: OR (95%CI) = 1.75 (1.39, 2.20); T2: 1.52 (1.26, 2.05); T3: 1.60 (1.18, 2.05)) and anxiety (T1: 2.00 (1.57, 2.55); T2: 1.86 (1.37, 2.54); T3: 1.33 (0.99, 1.79)). In the longitudinal analysis, multilevel model revealed that women with subjective “fair” or “bad” sleep quality had elevated risk of depression (OR ranging from 1.54 to 3.71) and anxiety (2.38 to 7.53) during pregnancy. Prenatal depression and anxiety status were prevalent in pregnant women. Sleep quality was associated with depression and anxiety status in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, implying that improving sleep quality should benefit for mental health of pregnant women.

TI  - Differences in infant care practices and smoking among Hispanic mothers living in the United States.
AU  - Provini, Lauren Elaine
AB  - Given that data assessing the heterogeneity of infant care practices among Hispanics are lacking, the objective of this study was to assess the association between maternal birth country and adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) safe sleep recommendations in a national sample of Hispanic mothers. We used a stratified, 2-stage, clustered design to obtain a nationally representative sample of mothers from 32 U.S. intrapartum hospitals. 907 completed follow-up surveys (administered 2-6 months postpartum) were received from mothers who self-identified as Hispanic/Latina, forming our sample, which we divided into 4 subpopulations by birth country (U.S., Mexico, Central/South America, and Caribbean). Prevalence estimates and aORs were determined for infant sleep position, location, breastfeeding, and maternal smoking. When compared with U.S.-born mothers, we found that: mothers born in the Caribbean (aOR 4.56, 95% CI 1.07-19.5) and Central/South America (aOR 2.68, 95% CI 1.38-5.22) were more likely to room share without bed sharing. Caribbean-born mothers were less likely to place infants to sleep supine (aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.77). Mothers born in Mexico (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.03-2.72) and Central/South America (aOR 2.57, 95% CI 1.09-6.07) were more likely to exclusively breastfeed; Caribbean-born mothers (aOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.63) were less likely to do so. Foreign-born mothers were significantly less likely to smoke before and during pregnancy. In conclusion, among U.S. Hispanics, adherence to AAP safe sleep recommendations varies widely by maternal birth country. These data illustrate the importance of examining behavioral heterogeneity among ethnic groups and have potential relevance for developing targeted interventions for safe infant sleep.

AB  - Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common during pregnancy. This study investigated the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered in pregnancy. Thirteen pregnant women with insomnia participated in five weekly CBT-I group sessions. All participants completed the study and provided baseline and follow-up data. Significant reductions in insomnia symptoms and increases in subjective sleep quality were observed over the course of the study. Diary and actigraphy assessments of sleep also changed, such that participants reported less time in bed (TIB), shorter sleep onset latency (SOL), increased sleep efficiency (SE), and increased subjective total sleep time (TST). Additionally, symptoms of depression, pregnancy-specific anxiety, and fatigue all decreased over the course of treatment. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. CBT-I delivered during pregnancy was associated with significant improvements in sleep and mood. The next step in this area of inquiry is to better establish effectiveness via a randomized controlled trial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Psychosocial stress during pregnancy has been proposed as a major contributor of glucocorticoid-mediated programming of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, with later adverse health consequences. However, evidence linking maternal stress to maternal cortisol values during pregnancy is inconclusive. A possible explanation for this is that other maternal factors overshadow any potential effects of stress on cortisol levels. We studied a large cohort of pregnant women with extensive data on pregnancy characteristics to determine the respective contributions of biological, environmental and psychosocial stress factors to cortisol levels in pregnancy. Methods: We used data from 3039 women from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development-study cohort. Serum cortisol was measured in blood, collected at the first prenatal visit, at different gestational ages (median = 91days, range = 40–256days), and at various time points during the day (median = 11:45h, range = 08:00–18:30h). We assessed associations between maternal serum cortisol in pregnancy and biological factors, lifestyle factors and stress factors, including depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, work stress, parenting stress and fatigue. Results: In multivariable analysis, variables that were associated with higher cortisol levels in pregnancy were lower maternal age [1.5nmol/l, 95%CI (0.6–2.4)], being nulliparous [21.5 nmol/l (15.9–27.1)], lower pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) [1.3nmol/l (0.3–2.4)], higher C-reactive protein (CRP) [1.0nmol/l (0.4–1.5)], carrying a female fetus [9.2nmol/l (1.8–16.5)], non-smoking [14.2nmol/l (0.6–27.7)], sufficient sleep [8.5nmol/l (0.9–16.1)], and being unemployed [12.7nmol/l (2.2–23.2)]. None of the psychosocial stressors was significantly associated with serum cortisol levels in pregnancy. A total of 32% of all variance in cortisol was explained by gestational age, maternal age, time of day, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, CRP, fetal sex, smoking behavior, self-reported sleep sufficiency, and employment. Conclusions: Our data suggest that maternal cortisol during pregnancy is mainly affected by biological and lifestyle factors, but not by psychosocial factors. We suggest that psychosocial stress in pregnancy might program the fetus through other mechanisms than through altering maternal cortisol levels.

T2  - Journal of Biological Rhythms
AB  - From the perspective of circadian biology, mammalian pregnancy presents an unusual biological scenario in which an entire circadian system (i.e., that of the fetus) is embodied within another (i.e., that of the mother). Moreover, both systems are likely to be influenced at their interface by a third player, the placenta. Successful pregnancy requires major adaptations in maternal physiology, many of which involve circadian changes that support the high metabolic demands of the growing fetus. A functional role for maternal circadian adaptations is implied by the effects of circadian disruption, which result in pregnancy complications including higher risks for miscarriage, preterm labor, and low birth weight. Various aspects of fetal physiology lead to circadian variation, at least in late gestation, but it remains unclear what drives this rhythmicity. It likely involves contributions from the maternal environment and possibly from the placenta and the developing intrinsic molecular clocks within fetal tissues. The role of the placenta is of particular significance because it serves not only to relay signals about the external environment (via the mother) but may also exhibit its own circadian rhythmicity. This review considers how the fetus may be influenced by dynamic circadian signals from the mother and the placenta during gestation, and how, in the face of these changing influences, a new fetal circadian system emerges. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of endocrine signals, most notably melatonin and glucocorticoids, as mediators of maternal-fetal circadian interactions, and on the expression of the clock gene in the 3 compartments. Further study is required to understand how the mother, placenta, and fetus interact across pregnancy to optimize circadian adaptations that support adequate growth and development of the fetus and its transition to postnatal life in a circadian environment.

TI  - Recollections of peripartum depression: A lived experience storytelling of peripartum depression among Latina women.
AU  - Moncada, Jacqueline
AB  - There have been many studies written about Latino women living with postpartum depression, but not perinatal depression. The purpose of this study was to document the everyday lived experiences of Latina women who survived peripartum depression, and to understand their help seeking behaviors and coping strategies. This study used transcendental phenomenology as a research design, as it sets aside prejudgments regarding the phenomenon being investigated. For this study, 15 Latina women who recalled their lived experience of peripartum depression served as the participants. Three themes emerged from the research conducted: 1) the lived experience of peripartum depression, 2) risk factors during pregnancy and after childbirth and; 3) personal experience of wellbeing. The symptomologies present in majority of the participants in this study included incongruent thoughts, flashbacks and the re-experience of traumas occurring prior to their pregnancy. These emotional triggers resulted in sleep deprivation, lethargy, crying spells and extreme fluctuations in mood. A common theme among all the participants was that depression was exacerbated due to opposing desires to honor the tenets of Mariansimo, while assimilating in North American culture that emphasize, "a woman should have it all." On the other hand, there were participants who, despite cultural traditions, sought professional help for their deepening depression. The result - several participants experienced a lack of sensitivity from medical providers. This led to suspiciousness of professional providers and a lack of trust, thereby impacting compliance with medical appointments and implementation of medical advice.

AB  - In two studies, the relationship between sleep and working memory performance was investigated in children born very preterm (i.e., gestation less than 32 weeks) and the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship. In Study 1, parent-reported measures of snoring, night-time sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness were collected on 89 children born very preterm aged 6 to 7 years. The children completed a verbal working memory task, as well as measures of processing speed and verbal storage capacity. Night-time sleep quality was found to be associated with verbal working memory performance over and above the variance associated with individual differences in processing speed and storage capacity, suggesting that poor sleep may have an impact on the executive component of working memory. Snoring and daytime sleepiness were not found to be associated with working memory performance. Study 2 introduced a direct measure of executive functioning and examined whether sleep problems would differentially impact the executive functioning of children born very preterm relative to children born to term. Parent-reported sleep problems were collected on 43 children born very preterm and 48 children born to term (aged 6 to 9 years). Problematic sleep was found to adversely impact executive functioning in the very preterm group, while no effect of sleep was found in the control group. These findings implicate executive dysfunction as a possible mechanism by which problematic sleep adversely impacts upon cognition in children born very preterm, and suggest that sleep problems can increase the cognitive vulnerability already experienced by many of these children.

TI  - Shortened sleep duration in pregnancy and adverse maternal and infant outcomes.
AU  - Williams, Jennifer L.
AB  - Background: Women's sleep needs increase during pregnancy. Most pregnant women need more sleep than the 7-8 hours needed by non-pregnant individuals. One-quarter to one-third of pregnant women experience short sleep duration (<7 hours) as early as the first trimester; with the proportion experiencing shortened sleep duration increasing as pregnancy progresses. Limited evidence suggests that self-reported shortened sleep duration (SRSSD) in pregnancy adversely affects maternal cardiometabolic and infant birth outcomes. The purpose of this study is to determine if SRSSD is independently associated with clinically diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), incident hypertension in pregnancy, preeclampsia, preterm birth (PTB) or small for gestational age (SGA). Sample and Design: Data was derived from the Pregnancy and Influenza Study (PIP), a prospective, observational cohort of pregnant women receiving prenatal care through two managed health care systems. Data from a subset of PIP enrollees (n=1271) were obtained from enrollment interviews, and electronic medical records. Univariate associations between SRSSD and dependent clinical outcomes, between SRSSD and covariates, and between clinical outcomes and covariates was conducted using Pearson chi-squared (chi 2) tests. Multinomial logistic regression models were conducted for each outcome. Analyses were conducted with SPSS version 21(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results: The majority of women reported sleeping seven to nine hours a night (69%). SRSSD was reported by 11% of respondents. Factors associated with SRSSD at a p value <0.05 included maternal age at conception, race/ethnicity, education, cohabiting with a spouse or partner, and smoke exposure. Percentages of women with selected outcomes were: GDM (9%); incident hypertension in pregnancy (7%); preeclampsia (3%), preterm (3%) and SGA (6%). In logistic regression models, SRSSD was not associated with clinically diagnosed GDM (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.98), incident hypertension in pregnancy (aOR 0.69, CI 0.29-1.66), preeclampsia, (aOR 1.54 CI 0.56-4.25), PTB (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.25-2.98) or SGA (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 0.86-2.70). Conclusion: Results from this analysis did not find associations between SRSSD and clinically diagnosed GDM, incident hypertension in pregnancy, preeclampsia, PTB or SGA. Further research is needed on the effects of sleep duration and adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Up to 18% of men experience depression and/or anxiety during the transition to parenthood. Interventions designed specifically to promote the mental health of men during the transition to parenthood are scarce. Internet-delivered interventions may be acceptable and far-reaching in enhancing mental health, parenting knowledge, and healthy behaviors in expectant or new fathers. Objective: To guide the development of Healthydads.ca, a website designed to enhance mental health and healthy behaviors in expectant fathers, a needs assessment was conducted to identify fathers’ perspectives of barriers to seeking help for emotional wellness, informational needs, and factors affecting the decision to visit such a website. Methods: One hundred and seventy-four men whose partners were expecting, or had recently given birth, in 3 Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta) completed a Web-based survey inquiring about information needs related to psychosocial aspects of the transition to parenthood, lifestyle behaviors, parenting, and factors associated with the decision to visit a father-focused website. Results: Most men (155/174, 89.1%) reported accessing the Internet to obtain information on pregnancy and spent an average of 6.2 hours online per month. Seeking information about parenting on the Internet was reported by 67.2% (117/174) of men, with a mean of 4.4 hours per month of online searching. Top barriers to seeking help to improve emotional wellness during the perinatal period were: no time to seek help/assistance (130/174, 74.7%), lack of resources available in the health care system (126/174, 72.4%), financial costs associated with services (118/174, 67.8%), and feeling that one should be able to do it alone (113/174, 64.9%). Information needs that were rated highly included: parenting/infant care (52.9-81.6%), supporting (121/174, 69.5%) and improving (124/174, 71.3%) relationship with their partner, work-family balance (120/174, 69.0%), improving sleep (100/174, 57.5%), and managing stress (98/174, 56.3%). Perceiving the website as personally relevant (151/174, 86.8%), credible (141/174, 81.0%), effective (140/145, 80.5%), and having an easy navigation structure (141/174, 81.0%) were identified as important factors related to a first website visit. Providing useful (134/174, 77.0%) and easy to understand (158/174, 90.8%) information, which was also free of charge (156/174, 89.7%), were considered important for deciding to prolong a website visit. Providing the possibility to post questions to a health professional (133/174, 76.4%), adding new content regularly (119/174, 68.4%), and personal motivation (111/174, 63.8%) were factors identified that would encourage a revisit. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that there is substantial interest among expectant and new fathers for using Internet-delivered strategies to prepare for the transition to parenthood and support their mental health. Specific user and website features were identified to optimize the use of father-focused websites. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Association of malaria control methods and healthcare access among pregnant women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
AU  - Hardee, Angelica M.
AB  - Introduction: Malaria is a major public health problem and life-threatening disease. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), roughly 400 children die every day and almost half of these deaths are attributable to malaria. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under age 5 in the DRC, accounting for an estimated 40% of outpatient visits and 40% of childhood mortality. The purpose of this study was to examine whether malaria control methods (i.e., insecticide bed net use and taking sp/fansidar or chloroquine for malaria) differed based on perceived problems preventing pregnant women from seeking medical advice or treatment (big problem, not a big problem), receipt of prenatal care (no, yes) and source of prenatal care (e.g., doctor), and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: A secondary data analysis of pregnant women (n = 2,404) who completed the Demographic and Health Survey in the DRC (DHS-DRC7) was conducted. Results: Results indicated that use of a mosquito bed net, taking sp/fansidar, and taking chloroquine for malaria significantly differed among pregnant women based on educational attainment, ethnicity, and wealth index. Pregnant women who did not sleep under a bed net were more likely to not receive ANC (p = .002), including 1.95 times more likely (p = .002) to not receive care from a doctor than pregnant women who did not sleep under a mosquito net. Pregnant women who did not take sp/fansidar for malaria during pregnancy were more likely to perceive that distance to a health facility (p < .001) and not wanting to go alone (p = .009) were big problems for getting medical help for themselves. Pregnant women who did not take sp/fansidar during pregnancy were more likely to not receive care from a doctor (p = .01), nurse (p = .002) or birth attendant (p < .001). Pregnant women who did not take chloroquine for malaria while pregnant were 3.6 times more likely (p = .04) to not receive care from a doctor. Discussion: Awareness of malaria control methods is critical in shaping the necessary interventions and policies toward the control of such diseases and addressing this global health disparity. The study found several healthcare utilization factors related to malaria control methods among pregnant women in the DRC. Next steps include enhancement of education among pregnant women about malaria control methods and access to care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To quantify the quality of life (QoL) and visit-specific satisfaction of pregnant women. Design: A prospective cohort within a practice-based research network (PBRN). Setting/Locations: Individual chiropractic offices. Subjects: Pregnant women (age ≥18 years) attending chiropractic care. Intervention(s): Chiropractic care (i.e., The Webster Technique, spinal adjustments, and adjunctive therapies). Main outcome measures: The RAND VSQ9 to measure visit-specific satisfaction and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®)-29 to measure QoL. Results: A convenience sample of 343 pregnant patients (average age = 30.96 years) comprised their study population. They were highly educated with 75% attaining a 2-year associate's degree or higher. The pregnant patients presented for chiropractic care with a mean week of gestation of 25.67 weeks (median = 28 weeks; range = 0–42 weeks) and parity (i.e., the number of live births) of 0.92 live births (median = 1; range = 0–6). From baseline (i.e., at study entrance with minimum first visit) and comparative (i.e., following a course of chiropractic care), the VSQ9 measurements revealed increasingly high satisfaction on the part of the subjects (i.e., the mean difference of baseline minus comparative measures = −0.7322; p p p p p p p = 0.1404) or depression (p = 0.8785) changed. Conclusion: A PBRN study was successfully implemented among chiropractors to find pregnant patients highly satisfied and their QoL scores improving with care beyond chance.

AB  - Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at 28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200–600 lux and night was 5–30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36–44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants.

AB  - This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify “red flag symptoms” suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.

AB  - Background: Evidence suggests a relation between plasma tryptophan concentrations and sleep and mental wellbeing. As no studies have been performed in pregnant women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26–28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were measured at 26–28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor sleep quality (PSQI global score > 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS ≥ 15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state ≥ 41) were calculated adjusting for covariates. Results: Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0 μmol/L (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10 μmol/L], especially in those participants who also suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal sleep quality or mental well-being. Limitation: Subjective measures were used to assess sleep and mental well-being. Conclusions: We observed that higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12% lower prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk of affective psychoses following childbirth (i.e. “postpartum psychosis”, PP) and there is a need to identify which factors underlie this increased risk. Vulnerability to mood dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is typified by sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes triggered by sleep loss was associated with PP in women with bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on whether mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of PP were compared between women who did and did not report mood episodes following sleep loss. Results: Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.47–2.97, p < 0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p = 0.526). Limitations: Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes. Conclusions: In clinical practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.

AB  - Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suffer from concurrent medical symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) and sleeping problems. However, there is limited information on the correlation between co-morbidities and autistic behavioral symptoms. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of GI and sleep problems in Chinese ASD children, examined the impacts of GI and sleep problems on autistic behavioral symptoms, and investigated the factors associated with GI and sleep problems. The survey included 169 ASD and 172 healthy children. Data regarding demographic characteristics, GI symptoms, sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms were collected through questionnaires. GI and sleep problems were prevalent in Chinese ASD children. Moreover, ASD children with GI symptoms reported more severe ASD core symptoms than others. Autistic children's GI symptoms were associated with maternal sleep problems during pregnancy, child's 0–6 month food sources and picky eating. ASD children with sleep disturbances had lower performance in daily living skills, social cognition, social communication and intellectual development than ASD children without sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances were associated with extra nutrient supply during lactation and feeding, and child's picky eating. Autistic children with GI or/and sleep problems may represent clinically relevant subtypes of ASD, for which targeted treatments may be needed.

AB  - This cross-sectional study aims to determine the prevalence and determinants of depressive symptoms in first -time expectant fathers during their partner’s third trimester of pregnancy. As part of a prospective study examining depressive symptoms in men over the first postnatal year, 622 men (mean age = 34.3 years, ± 5.0 years) completed standardized online self-report questionnaires measuring depressed mood, physical activity, sleep quality, social support, marital adjustment, life events, financial stress, and demographics during their partner’s third trimester of pregnancy. The Edinburgh Depression Scale was used to assess depressed mood. Partners also completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale in the third trimester. The results revealed that 13.3% of expectant fathers exhibited elevated levels of depressive symptoms during their partner’s third trimester of pregnancy. Significant independent factors associated with antenatal depressive symptoms in men were poorer sleep quality, family history of psychological difficulties, lower perceived social support, poorer marital satisfaction, more stressful life events in the preceding 6 months, greater number of financial stressors, and elevated maternal antenatal depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of including fathers in the screening and early prevention efforts targeting depression during the transition to parenthood, which to date have largely focused only on women. Strategies to promote better sleep, manage stress, and mobilize social support may be important areas to address in interventions tailored to new fathers at risk for depression during the transition to parenthood.

AB  - Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been suggested as a potential mechanism linking sleep and cardiometabolic disorders. However, the associations of two primary outputs of the HPA axis, cortisol and its antagonist dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), with sleep are less well studied. In the Nurses' Health Study II, 233 postmenopausal women provided five timed saliva samples over one day (immediately upon waking, 45 min, 4 h, and 10 h after waking, and prior to going to sleep) to measure cortisol and DHEA. Of these, 209 completed assessment of their habitual sleep patterns using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We used piecewise linear mixed models to compare cross-sectional associations of slopes reflecting diurnal cortisol and DHEA rhythms with overall sleep quality and with seven sub-components. Overall, we observed no differences in the diurnal patterns of cortisol or DHEA between good versus poor sleepers as assessed by the global PSQI score. However, longer sleep latency was associated with significantly reduced cortisol awakening rise (p = 0.02). Poorer subjective sleep quality (p = 0.02), shorter sleep duration (p = 0.02), and lower sleep efficiency (p = 0.03) were associated with slower rate of cortisol decline later in the day. Women reporting daytime dysfunction had a sharper cortisol decline early in the day (p = 0.03) but a flattened decline later in the day (p = 0.01). The differences in diurnal patterns of DHEA between good versus poor sleepers, though less pronounced, were similar in direction to those of cortisol. Self-reported sleep duration, efficiency, latency and daytime dysfunction were associated with altered diurnal rhythms of cortisol and, to a lesser extent, DHEA. These findings provide support for the interplay between sleep and the HPA axis that may contribute to cardiometabolic disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: The present study focuses on mother's spontaneous touch during the very first skin to skin kangaroo care with premature babies in NICU. The aim is to test the hypothesis according to which, compared to the usual installation where the baby is installed vertically in the mother's clothes between the breast, the innovative installation in Supported diagonal flexion (FDS) fosters a more positive qualitative mother's touch, a touch dedicated more to enriching and scaffolding interactions with the preemie and less focused on postural support. Method: Twenty very preterm infants between 27 and 31 weeks gestation and their mothers were offered skin to skin sessions. The first 10 infants included were offered the usual vertical positioning and a breastfeeding pillow for support. The following ten were offered SDF. The first five minutes of the session were videotaped and coded with The Observer software. Results: In the usual vertical positioning mother's hands were used 59% of the time to maintain infant posture (hold or contain infant's body), therefore using touch for mechanical reasons (vs 1% in SDF positioning; 95% CI 47.2–67.2). With the SDF positioning, mothers used their hands for affective touch (36% vs 20% in the usual vertical positioning; 95% CI 5.3–30.0) and to signal presence (39% vs 20% in the usual vertical positioning; 95% CI 7.8–31.4). Infants were mostly in active sleep, and drowsiness was lowered in the FDS group as compared to the “as usual” one. There was no quiet awake or active awake state during skin to skin's SDF positioning sessions. Our results also showed that affective touch took place on the head in the vertical group whereas it was more frequently directed on the face in the SDF group. Mothers in the SDF group tended spontaneously more to rock their baby. Conclusion: With SDF positioning, mothers spontaneously used more active touch and expressed more affection through touch. The present study is part of a longitudinal follow-up from birth until 3 months corrected age. The vocal production and visual engagement of both partners are under analysis and will be considered in the light of the mothering touch interactions described here. Further research to describe interactions in all of their dimensions is necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Postnatal maturation of amplitude integrated electroencephalography (AEEG) in preterm small for gestational age neonates: A prospective cohort study.
AU  - Arora, Kamaldeep
AB  - Background: Small for gestational age (SGA; defined as birth weight less than 10th percentile for the population) neonates are at higher risk of delayed neuronal maturation and short and long term adverse neurocognitive outcomes compared to their appropriate gestational age (AGA) counterparts. Amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), a simplified bedside tool for measuring brain function in neonates, has been shown to undergo a distinctive postnatal maturation in preterm infants. There is no information if being SGA affects the postnatal maturation of aEEG in preterm infants. Objectives: To compare the postnatal maturation of aEEG during the first two weeks of life in preterm SGA and AGA infants born between 30 and 34 weeks' gestation. Outcome measures: Primary: the aEEG maturation score as defined by Burdjalov et al consisting of sum of individual scores of four parameters namely continuity, sleep wake cycle, band width, and amplitude of lower border of the traces recorded on 3rd, 7th and 14th postnatal days of life. Secondary: individual scores of four parameters namely continuity, sleep wake cycle, band width, and amplitude of lower border of the traces recorded on 3rd, 7th and 14th postnatal days of life. Study design: Prospective double cohort study. Methods: We recruited 19 SGA and 21 AGA stable infants born at 30 to 34 weeks of gestation at the tertiary care neonatal unit in All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. We performed serial aEEGs in all the enrolled infants at postnatal ages of 3rd, 7th and 14th days of life. The three blinded assessors assigned scores for the primary outcome using the validated score. Generalized estimating equation was performed to compare maturation scores between SGA and AGA groups. validated score. Generalized estimating equation was performed to compare maturation scores between SGA and AGA groups. Results: We analyzed a total of 117 aEEG recordings in 40 preterm babies. The baselines characteristics were comparable in the two groups except for birth weight (g; mean+/-SD in SGA vs AGA groups: 1186+/-263 vs 1666+/-230, p=0.00). The mean gestational age was comparable in two groups (31.9+1,3 vs 32.2+/-1,2, p=0.42). The aEEG maturation score increased in the AGA cohort from 3rd day through 14th day while in SGA cohort, it slightly declined on day 7 and increased by day 14 of life. The score in SGA cohort was slightly lower compared to AGA on day 7 (meaniSD: 8.6+/-2.4 vs 10.111.1, p=0.02) and at day 14 (10.2+/-1.3 vs 10.7+0.8, p=0.11). On an average at any time point during the first 14 days of life, the score lagged by 0.8 (Cl: -1.6 to -0.02, P=0.04) in SGA infants compared to AGA infants. Mean score for continuity was similar in two groups at all study time points, while that for cycling and lower border showed a significant difference at day 7 (p=0.03 each) but not at days 3 and 14. Mean score for bandwidth showed a significant difference at day 7 (p=0.05) and day 14 (p=0.03) but not at day 3 (p=0.6). Conclusion: The postnatal aEEG maturation in SGA compared to AGA infants born at gestation 30 to 34 weeks is delayed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The letter presents a study on A Behavioral Intervention for Insomnia Improves Blood Pressure. Insomnia is associated with sympathetic nervous system (SNS) arousal and hypertension. The authors tested whether improving sleep in individuals with insomnia affects blood pressure (BP). Fourteen adults with chronic insomnia completed the study (n=8 females; age: 46.6 ± 11.5 y; BMI: 26.8 ± 4.2 kg/m2). Exclusion criteria included sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), restless legs syndrome (RLS), narcolepsy, psychiatric/neurologic disorders, shiftwork, recent trans-meridian travel, those having a child at home who is younger than one-year-old, and current pregnancy. Wearing amber-tinted lenses as a behavioral intervention aimed at reducing exposure to pre-bedtime blue-wavelength light was found to reduce BP. This BP-lowering effect may have been caused by an improvement in sleep or by reducing stress/anxiety and SNS arousal. This approach should be tested in individuals with comorbid hypertension and insomnia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The placenta is important in providing a healthy environment for the fetus and plays a central role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Fetal and placental developments are influenced by epigenetic programming. There is some evidence that PE is controlled to an altered circadian homeostasis. In a nested case–control study embedded in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, we obtained placental tissue, umbilical cord leukocytes (UCL), and human umbilical venous endothelial cells of 13 early-onset PE, 16 late-onset PE and 83 controls comprising 36 uncomplicated and 47 complicated pregnancies, i.e. 27 fetal growth restricted and 20 spontaneous preterm birth. To investigate the associations between PE and the epigenetics of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes in placental and newborn tissues, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip and a candidate-gene approach using ANCOVA was applied on 939 CpGs of 39 circadian clock and clock-controlled genes. DNA methylation significantly differed in early-onset PE compared with spontaneous preterm birth at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (3.73E-5 ≤ p ≤ 0.016) and at 21 CpGs in UCL (1.09E-5≤ p ≤ 0.024). In early-onset PE compared with fetal growth restriction 2 CpGs in placental tissue (p p ≤ 0.049) were significantly different. Moreover, significantly different DNA methylation in early-onset PE compared with uncomplicated controls was shown at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (1.36E-4 ≤ p ≤ 0.045) and 11 CpGs in uncomplicated controls (2.52E-6≤ p ≤ 0.009). No significant associations were shown with late-onset PE between study groups or tissues. The most differentially methylated CpGs showed hypomethylation in placental tissue and hypermethylation in uncomplicated controls. In conclusion, DNA methylation of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes demonstrated most differences in UCL of early-onset PE compared with spontaneous preterm birth. Implications of the tissue-specific variations in epigenetic programming for circadian performance and long-term health need further investigation.

TI  - Risk-taking behaviors and impulsivity in emerging adults born prematurely.
AU  - Yaugher, Ashley Christine
AB  - Recently there has been an increase in research focusing on the role of sleep in psychological disorders in adolescents and young adults due to both increases in risk-taking behaviors and continued brain development during this period. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to extend findings of a master's thesis suggesting a relationship between subjective and objective measures of sleep and externalizing disorders in young adults in a community setting to a vulnerable population (i.e., emerging adults born prematurely). Measures include sleep behavior (Actigraphy, PSQI), birth status, objective measures of impulsivity and risk-taking (CPT-II, BART, Eye-Tracking), and subjective measures of both internalizing and externalizing disorder traits (TriPM, BIS 11, PAI scales, BPS). A total of 227 participants completed the study, including 71 men (premature n = 32) and 156 women (premature n = 103). Participants in the sample showed high average percentages of sleep (M = 91.91%) and few participants reported clinically elevated scores on the measures (≤ 13.45%), as would be expected. Results extend previous findings that both externalizing (i.e., psychopathy as measured by the TriPM) and internalizing (i.e., depression as measured by the PAI) traits decrease subjective sleep quality (i.e., PSQI scores). Results show that on average women born prematurely report increased internalizing traits compared with full term women and men born preterm or full term; while men born prematurely report lower levels of antisocial traits and behaviors (i.e., more female typical) when compared to full term men but still higher levels compared to women born preterm or full term. Results further suggest that premature birth status is associated with significantly lower rates of antisocial traits, particularly when severity of premature birth increases (i.e., fewer weeks of gestation). The community population and birth status is often not of focus in sleep research with the exception of sleep disordered breathing, and thus findings add to our understanding of this vulnerable population in emerging adults born prematurely who are attending college.

TI  - Perinatal programming of circadian clock-stress crosstalk.
AU  - Astiz, Mariana
AU  - Oster, Henrik
T2  - Neural Plasticity
AB  - An intact communication between circadian clocks and the stress system is important for maintaining physiological homeostasis under resting conditions and in response to external stimuli. There is accumulating evidence for a reciprocal interaction between both—from the systemic to the molecular level. Disruption of this interaction by external factors such as shiftwork, jetlag, or chronic stress increases the risk of developing metabolic, immune, or mood disorders. From experiments in rodents, we know that both systems maturate during the perinatal period. During that time, exogenous factors such as stress or alterations in the external photoperiod may critically affect—or program—physiological functions later in life. This developmental programming process has been attributed to maternal stress signals reaching the embryo, which lastingly change gene expression through the induction of epigenetic mechanisms. Despite the well-known function of the adult circadian system in temporal coordination of physiology and behavior, the role of maternal and embryonic circadian clocks during pregnancy and postnatal development is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the circadian-stress crosstalk at different periods of development may help to improve stress resistance and devise preventive and therapeutic strategies against chronic stress-associated disorders.

AB  - Background: For many women, pregnancy-related sleep disturbances and pregnancy-related anxiety change as pregnancy progresses and both are associated with lower maternal quality of life and less favorable birth outcomes. Thus, the interplay between these two problems across pregnancy is of interest. In addition, psychological resilience may explain individual differences in this association, as it may promote coping with both sleep disturbances and anxiety, and thereby reduce their mutual effects. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether sleep quality and sleep duration, and changes in sleep are associated with the level of and changes in anxiety during pregnancy. Furthermore, the study tested the moderating effect of resilience on these associations. Methods: At gestational weeks 14, 24, and 34, 532 pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland filled out questionnaires on general sleep quality, sleep duration and pregnancy-related anxiety; resilience was assessed in week 14. Results: Parallel process latent growth curve models showed that shorter initial sleep duration predicted a higher initial level of anxiety, and a higher initial anxiety level predicted a faster shortening of sleep duration. Changes in sleep duration and changes in anxiety over the course of pregnancy were not related. The predicted moderating effect of resilience was not found. Conclusions: The results suggested that pregnant women reporting anxiety problems should also be screened for sleeping problems, and vice versa, because women who experienced one of these pregnancy-related problems were also at risk of experiencing or developing the other problem.

AB  - Reports an error in "Immediate effects of phototherapy on sleep in very preterm neonates: An observational study" by Cremer Martin, Jost Kerstin, Anna Gensmer, Isabelle Pramana, Edgar Delgado‐Eckert, Urs Frey, Sven M. Schulzke and Alexandre N. Datta (Journal of Sleep Research, 2016[Oct][25], Vol 25[5], 517-523). In the original article, the p values and legend in figure 1 were incorrectly mentioned. The correct figure 1 is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-49625-003). Process C (internal clock) and Process S (sleep–wake homeostasis) are the basis of sleep–wake regulation. In the last trimester of pregnancy, foetal heart rate is synchronized with the maternal circadian rhythm. At birth, this interaction fails and an ultradian rhythm appears. Light exposure is a strong factor influencing the synchronization of sleep–wake processes. However, little is known about the effects of phototherapy on the sleep rhythm of premature babies. It was hypothesized that sleep in preterm infants would not differ during phototherapy, but that a maturation effect would be seen. Sleep states were studied in 38 infants born P = 0.083). Analysis of videos in infants not under phototherapy revealed an increase in time spent awake with increasing gestational age. The current data suggest that the ultradian rhythm of preterm infants seems to be independent of phototherapy, supporting the notion that sleep rhythm in this population is mainly driven by their internal clock.

AB  - Major depression occurs in 5–10% of pregnancies and is associated with many negative effects for mother and child, yet treatment options are scarce. To our knowledge, this is the first published randomised controlled trial on Internet delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) for this group. Objective: To test the efficacy of a pregnancy adapted version of an existing 10-week ICBT-program for depression as well as assessing acceptability and adherence Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Online and telephone. Population or sample: Self-referred pregnant women (gestational week 10–28 at intake) currently suffering from major depressive disorder. Methods: 42 pregnant women (gestational week 12–28) with major depression were randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) provided at their antenatal clinic or to ICBT as an add-on to usual care. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale-self report (MADRS-S). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and measures of anxiety and sleep were used. Credibility, satisfaction, adherence and utilization were also assessed. Results: The ICBT group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms post treatment (p g =1.21) and were more likely to be responders (i.e. achieve a statistically reliable improvement) (RR = 0.36; p = 0.004). Measures of treatment credibility, satisfaction, utilization, and adherence were comparable to implemented ICBT for depression. Limitations: Small sample size and no long-term evaluation. Conclusion: Pregnancy adapted ICBT for antenatal depression is feasible, acceptable and efficacious. These results need to be replicated in larger trials to validate these promising findings.

AB  - The organization of functional brain networks changes across human lifespan. The present study analyzed functional brain networks in healthy full‐term infants (N = 139) within 1–6 days from birth by measuring neural synchrony in EEG recordings during quiet sleep. Large‐scale phase synchronization was measured in six frequency bands with the Phase Lag Index. Macroscopic network organization characteristics were quantified by constructing unweighted minimum spanning tree graphs. The cortical networks in early infancy were found to be significantly more hierarchical and had a more cost‐efficient organization compared with MST of random control networks, more so in the theta and alpha than in other frequency bands. Frontal and parietal sites acted as the main hubs of these networks, the topological characteristics of which were associated with gestation age (GA). This suggests that individual differences in network topology are related to cortical maturation during the prenatal period, when functional networks shift from strictly centralized toward segregated configurations.

AB  - Pregnant women have a two- to threefold increased prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) compared to the general population, and the majority of RLS patients also experience periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). PLMS have been associated with sleep disturbance as well as autonomic heart rate and blood pressure responses; however, the prevalence, cause and significance of PLMS during pregnancy remain unknown. This study evaluated the presence of PLMS in late pregnancy and its relationship to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Ninety-one women in the third trimester of pregnancy underwent overnight polysomnography. An RLS questionnaire and the Multivariate Apnea Risk Index were administered and venous blood was sampled within 2 weeks of the sleep study. After exclusions due to obstructive sleep apnoea and signal loss, PLMS data were available for 73 women, 36 hypertensive women and 37 BMI- and gestation-matched controls. PLMS were found to be very common during pregnancy; 45% of women had a PLMS index > 5 and 25% had a PLMS index > 15. The number of PLMS per hour did not differ by hypertensive status. Sleep quality was mostly unaffected by PLMS, as was change in blood pressure overnight. While RLS was reported by 18.3% of the sample, this did not reliably predict the presence of PLMS. Despite iron deficiency being common in this population, it was not associated with PLMS. This novel study investigating the frequency and impact of PLMS during pregnancy revealed that PLMS are very common in the third trimester; however, this disorder appears to be benign in terms of objective sleep quality and relationship with pregnancy-related hypertension.

AB  - This study examined the course of antidepressant use, sleep quality, and depression severity from pregnancy through 6-month postpartum in women with and without a depressive disorder during pregnancy. Women (N = 215) were interviewed during pregnancy, 1- and 6-month postpartum. Mixed linear models were used to examine the longitudinal course and inter-relationships for the time-varying variables of antidepressant use, subjective sleep quality, and depression severity. Pregnant women with a depressive disorder who did not use antidepressants had more variable depression severity over time with improvements in depression severity by 6-month postpartum. In contrast, the depression severity of their medicated counterparts remained stable and high throughout. Pregnant women without a depressive disorder had worse sleep quality when using antidepressants compared with when they were not. Antidepressant use significantly strengthened the magnitude of the effect of sleep quality on depression severity in women with a depressive disorder during pregnancy. When prenatally depressed women use antidepressants, their sleep disturbance is more highly linked to depression severity than when they do not. Furthermore, antidepressants are not adequately treating the sleep disturbance of these women or their remitted counterparts, leaving both groups vulnerable to significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.

T2  - Development and Psychopathology
AB  - The consequences of childhood maltreatment are profound and long lasting. Not only does the victim of abuse suffer as a child, but there is mounting evidence that a history of maltreatment places the next generation at risk for significant psychopathology. Research identifies postnatal factors as affecting this intergenerational transmission of trauma. However, emerging evidence suggests that part of this risk may be transmitted before birth, passed on via abuse-related alterations in the in utero environment that are as yet largely unidentified. To date, no study has directly assessed the influence of pregnant women's abuse history on fetal neurobehavioral development, nor considered trauma-associated poor sleep quality as a mediator reflecting established physiological dysregulation. Using data from 262 pregnant adolescents (ages 14–19), a population at elevated risk for childhood maltreatment, the current study examined maternal emotional abuse history and sleep quality in relation to third-trimester fetal resting heart rate variability, an index of parasympathetic nervous system functioning. The results indicate that maternal emotional abuse history is indirectly associated with lower fetal heart rate variability via abuse-related sleep disturbances. These data demonstrate an association between maternal abuse histories and fetal development, showing that at least part of the intergenerational transmission of risk occurs during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Few studies have addressed obesity prevention among low-income families whose infants are at increased obesity risk. We tested a Facebook peer-group intervention for low-income mothers to foster behaviors promoting healthy infant growth. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 87 pregnant women (Medicaid insured, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) were randomized to the Grow2Gether intervention or text message appointment reminders. Grow2Gether participants joined a private Facebook group of 9–13 women from 2 months before delivery until infant age 9 months. A psychologist facilitated groups featuring a curriculum of weekly videos addressing feeding, sleep, parenting, and maternal well-being. Feasibility was assessed using the frequency and content of participation, and acceptability using surveys. Maternal beliefs and behaviors and infant growth were assessed at birth, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months. Differences in infant growth between study arms were explored. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using quasi-least-squares regression. Results: Eighty-eight percent (75/85) of intervention participants (42% (36/85) food insecure, 88% (75/85) black) reported the group was helpful. Participants posted 30 times/group/week on average. At 9 months, the intervention group had significant improvement in feeding behaviors (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire) compared to the control group (p = 0.01, effect size = 0.45). Intervention group mothers were significantly less likely to pressure infants to finish food and, at age 6 months, give cereal in the bottle. Differences were not observed for other outcomes, including maternal feeding beliefs or infant weight-for-length. Conclusions: A social media peer-group intervention was engaging and significantly impacted certain feeding behaviors in families with infants at high risk of obesity.

T2  - Neuropsychopharmacology
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests a role for inflammation in neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous work in rodents has established that immune activation during critical developmental periods can cause phenotypes that reproduce core features of ASD, including decreased social interaction, aberrant communication, and increased repetitive behavior. In humans, ASD is frequently associated with comorbid medical conditions including sleep disorders, motor hyperactivity, and seizures. Here we use a ‘two-hit’ immune-activation paradigm to determine whether perinatal immune activation can also produce these comorbid features in mice. In this paradigm, we treated timed-pregnant mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which simulates a viral infection, on gestational day 12.5 according to an established maternal immune activation regimen. A subset of the offspring also received a second ‘hit’ of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which simulates a bacterial infection, on postnatal day 9. At 6 weeks of age, mice were implanted with wireless telemetry transmitters that enabled continuous measurements of electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), locomotor activity, and subcutaneous temperature. Effects at 7 and 12 weeks of age were compared. Both prenatal Poly I:C and postnatal LPS produced changes in locomotor activity and temperature patterns, increases in slow-wave sleep, and shifts in EEG spectral power, several of which persisted at 12 weeks of age. Postnatal LPS also produced persistent increases in spontaneous bursts of epileptiform activity (spike-wave discharges) that occurred predominantly during sleep. Our findings demonstrate that early-life immune activation can lead to long-lasting physiologic perturbations that resemble medical comorbidities often seen in ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions.

T2  - Maternal and Child Health Journal
AB  - Objectives Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked with ill-health in adulthood, but ACE literature has focused on family disruption or dysfunction (e.g., child abuse, parental separation), with less attention to economic adversity. We examined whether a mother’s economic hardship in childhood (EHC) was associated with women’s hardships and health-risk behaviors during/just before pregnancy. Methods We analyzed population-based survey data on 27,102 postpartum California women. EHC included respondents’ reports that during childhood they/their families experienced hunger because of inability to afford food or moved because of problems paying rent/mortgage and the frequency of difficulty paying for basic needs. We examined six maternal hardships/behaviors during/just before pregnancy, including four hardships (poverty, food insecurity, homelessness/no regular place to sleep, intimate partner violence) and two behaviors (smoking, binge drinking). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated from sequential logistic regression models estimating associations between EHC (categorized by level of hardship) and each maternal hardship/behavior, first without adjustment, then adjusting for other childhood and current maternal factors, and finally adding family disruption/dysfunction. Results Before adjustment for family disruption/dysfunction, the highest and intermediate EHC levels were associated with each maternal hardship/behavior; after full adjustment, those associations persisted except with smoking. Higher EHC levels generally appeared associated with larger PRs, although confidence intervals overlapped. Conclusions for Policy/Practice These findings link childhood economic hardship with women’s hardships, binge drinking, and possibly smoking around the time of pregnancy. Without establishing causality, they support previous research indicating that childhood economic adversity should be considered an ACE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Study Objectives: Zika virus infection during pregnancy may result in congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), whose characteristics are being described. Methods: The aim of the present study was to investigate the sleep characteristics of 136 infants and toddlers (88 with CZS and 48 with typical development [TD], age and gender matched, 60% girls and 40% boys in both groups) using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. The ages of children in both groups ranged from 5 to 24 months (CZS 15.9 ± 0.4 vs. TD 15.8 ± 1.0 months, p = 0.90). Results: The results show that 34.1% of CZS and 2% of TD children were defined as poor sleepers, 15% of CZS and 2% of TD children remained awake at night for a period longer than 1 hr, and 24% of CZS and 2% of TD children slept less than 9 hr. The CZS group showed shorter total sleep time (CZS 11.24 ± 2.6 vs. TD 12.02 ± 1.9 hr, p = 0.03) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration than the TD group (CZS 8.2 ± 0.2 vs. TD 9.4 ± 0.2 hr, p = 0.0002). In contrast to the control group (p = 0.02, r = −0.34), in the CZS group, no correlation was found between age and nocturnal wakefulness. Future studies should explore these data in relation to the development and maturation of the central nervous system of these children. Conclusions: Considering the well-known consequences of poor sleep quality on health in several populations, the presence of sleep disorders should be considered in CZS using multidisciplinary treatments.

TI  - Distress and sleep during adolescent pregnancy: Associations to fetal heart rate variability and attachment classification at 14 months.
AU  - Farber, Alexandra Elise Claire
AB  - Distress and sleep are associated across the lifespan, often overlapping in symptoms and exacerbating each other. Both distress and sleep disruptions are elevated during pregnancy and increasing evidence points to associated adverse maternal, birth, fetal, and infant outcomes. Fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) and attachment are two different markers of later child functioning, one physiological, and one relational. Although some studies have examined parts of this puzzle, this is the first study to examine the relationships among distress, sleep, FHRV, and attachment specifically in multicultural, urban, pregnant adolescents, who are at increased risk of distress and sleep disruptions. Participants (N = 298) were recruited through a large urban hospital and were assessed at three time points during their pregnancy, and once with their infants, 14 months after birth. Results support a replication in the association between prenatal sleep and distress in an adolescent sample, as well as indicating that distress predicts poor sleep, contrary to what was expected based on results from adult samples. Findings indicate that sleep disturbances and distress in the first trimester are associated with lower FHRV in the third trimester. Additionally, and while results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size, findings suggest that attachment in adolescent mother-infant dyads may not relate to prenatal variables in the ways expected based on adult samples. Further research is recommended to better understand how pre- and postnatal psychological and physiological variables interact in adolescents, who are navigating pregnancy and the transition to motherhood at a unique point in their own development.

TI  - Bullying in the workplace.
AU  - Rogers, Shelley
T2  - The elements of psychological case report writing in Australia.
AB  - A client named Elizabeth, a pseudonym, was referred for services in 2011 through her organisation’s Human Resources department in their efforts to address the client’s reaction to what the organization perceived to be to a single ‘incident’ of bullying against the client that had occurred in 2007. Elizabeth’s employer was a significant business, with a large workforce. The ‘incident’ referred to by the employer occurred four years before when a senior male colleague had sent an email that was intended to be highly offensive to and critical of Elizabeth and damaging to her professional career to over 100 people within her employment and professional circle. To implement the intervention, the initial focus was on the individual before shifting to the relationship between her and her workplace. 1 Stabilization of Elizabeth Elizabeth was the single mother and sole carer of a 6-year-old child as her husband and child's father had died while Elizabeth was pregnant. She had little support from family members. Elizabeth was the family's only breadwinner. She did not smoke, use alcohol, or other prescribed drugs. Elizabeth was strongly affiliated to a church. She had strong social connections outside her employment, almost all church related. The DASS 42 was used as a measure of Elizabeth's depression, anxiety, and stress. The depression scores were in the mild range and were not of particular concern. Initially Elizabeth's anxiety and stress scores were in the extremely severe range. Initial sessions were focused on assisting Elizabeth to sleep and eat better and to be more fully present when she was with her child. Being an otherwise highly functional individual with a good support structure, she was encouraged to engage in those aspects of her life that gave her pleasure and non-work meaning. Once her anxiety and stress had reduced somewhat, it was possible to focus more on what had occurred within the workplace, to help her gain perspective and plan a response. 2 Building a clear understanding of the conflict escalation The specific problem identified was that prior to and subsequent to the 'incident' Elizabeth had been the victim of at least four years of systematic, repeated and pervasive harassment, belittling, and other behaviours perpetrated by the same pair of individuals within her workplace in a manner that would be reasonably considered to be bullying. However, her employer appeared to not understand this fact and Elizabeth had been treated as if each incident were separate isolated events, without there being any understanding of the cumulative impact of years of workplace bullying. Consequently all the organisation's attempts to fix the problem as they saw it failed because the organization failed to see, or were not interested in seeing, the systematic, repeated, and pervasive nature of the bullying. Through a detailed examination of all the various events that had occurred over several years it became very clear that this was a repeated pattern of behaviour targeted at Elizabeth, to which the organisation had either failed to respond, or responded only in part having failed to complete a performance management process with the main offending colleagues, which was construed by Elizabeth as the organisation letting them get away with bullying (her)".

T2  - Psychoneuroendocrinology
AB  - Preterm birth (PTB) occurs among 1:11U.S. white women and 1:7.5 African American women and is a significant driver of racial disparities in infant mortality. Maternal stress is the most common clinical phenotype underlying spontaneous PTB. Specific patterns of stress and biological mediators driving PTB remain unclear. We examined the effect of childhood stress on birth timing among African American women and evaluated maternal cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. A prospective observational design was employed, with a single study visit at 28–32 weeks gestation and medical record review. The Stress and Adversity Inventory was administered, which provides a comprehensive estimate of childhood stress, stress in adulthood, and five core characteristic subscales (interpersonal loss, physical danger, humiliation, entrapment, role disruption). Venipuncture was performed between 11:00am and 4:00pm and plasma cortisol quantified by ELISA. Analyses controlled for stress in adulthood. Among a final sample of 89, cumulative childhood stress predicted birth timing (p = 0.01). The association was driven by stress related to interpersonal loss and physical danger, with support for maternal cortisol as a biological mediator (ab = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.045]; ab = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.043], respectively). Results were similar, overall, in sub-group analyses among spontaneously laboring women (n = 53); however, role disruption arose as an additional predictor, as mediated by cortisol elevations (ab = 0.03, 95% CI [0.005, 0.074]). Of note, cortisol was no longer supported as a mediator linking physical danger to birth timing after adjusting for sleep quality and hours awake prior to venipuncture (ab = 0.02, 95% CI [−0.0001, 0.046]). We provide preliminary evidence that, independent of stress in adulthood, childhood stress of specific core characteristics may shape birth timing, with cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. Further investigation is warranted and may bolster the development of biologically-informed screening tools for the prediction and targeted prevention of stress-related PTB.

T2  - Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy
AB  - Objective: Research has demonstrated that exposure to violence and adversity has negative effects on both mental health and biobehavioral outcomes, such as sleep health. Research examining the relationship between past and recent violence exposure and mental health suggests that the effects of childhood adversity are especially pernicious, but to date, no studies have attempted to disentangle the direct, indirect and relative effects of past year versus childhood exposure to violence and adversity on sleep. The objective of the current study was to examine the direct effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and past year intimate partner violence (IPV) on different aspects of sleep health in pregnant women. Method: A sample of high-risk pregnant women (n = 101) were interviewed. Mediation analysis with bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals was used to evaluate direct and indirect effects. Results: Findings indicated that while ACEs had significant direct effects on mental health, past year IPV had stronger effects on sleep quality, latency, and efficiency. ACEs did, however, indirectly affect subjective sleep quality via past year psychological IPV. Conclusion: These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may be a regulatory stress response that is most clearly linked to past year violence and trauma. That is, though long-term sleep disturbance may be evident following childhood adversity, it is likely that this relationship is better explained by the role of childhood adversity in predicting adulthood revictimization or due to long-term mental health difficulties associated with early trauma.

T2  - Sleep and Hypnosis
AB  - Objective: Given the significance of sleep quality among pregnant women and its effects on the health of the fetus and the lack of sufficient studies in this field as well, the present study aimed to both identify some of the psychological factors associated with sleep quality among pregnant women and investigate the relationship between sleep quality among pregnant women and other variables, including depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, perceived social support, and marital adjustment. Materials and methods: In this descriptive-correlational study, 425 pregnant women, visiting Islamabad and Ravansar–based prenatal care centers (randomly selected from the townships of Kermanshah Province (Iran)) in 2015, were selected. To collect the required data, the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (LWSMAT), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RIS), Zimet’s Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and depression, anxiety and stress scales were used. Results: The results of data analysis demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between the quality of sleep and variables like depression, anxiety, stress, perception, social support and marital adjustment. Further, the results showed that the hierarchical regression of all variables could predict 31% of the changes of sleep quality. Additionally, anxiety, depression and stress were ranked first, second and third in terms of the shares of variables in predicting the quality of sleep. Whereas, resilience, perceived social support and marital adjustment were unable to predict the quality of sleep. Conclusion: Given the results of the present study, it is suggested that the roles of the psychological factors be considered in improving the quality of sleep among pregnant women.

T2  - International Journal of Developmental Disabilities
AB  - Objective: Sleep complaints are clinically expected in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. We aim to reveal patterns of association among sleep–wake behaviors that are challenging in the life of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Through text-mining analyses, we numericized the transcripts of 59 caregiver’s informal, conversational interviews. That is, the relative frequencies-of-occurrences of words as well as their semantic specificities (italic) were clustered, categorized, and visualized for patterns. Results: A total of 4008 words were indexed where sleep took the 91st place of most important words. Sleep and wake were however not associatively conversed throughout the interviews. Sleep-related words conversed were: night, nap, apnea, asleep, awake, bed, bedroom, bedtime, mattress, melatonin, overnight, and wake-up. Among some FASD-characteristic words describing the challenges were: huge, alcohol, manage*, stop, adopt, crazy*. The semantic space reflecting these challenges experienced in caring for children with FASD was divided into two axes: child-oriented vs. other-oriented words, and day-related and night-related words. The position of sleep shows that problematic sleep was expressed as a ‘family’ issue. Clumsy* was interrelated with problematic sleeping and waking. Despite that mostly night was associatively conversed, the association of Routines, Managing, and Planning with sleep underscores the challenges faced. Conclusion: When conversing caregivers of children with FASD seldom interrelate ‘sleep’ but rather ‘night’ with FASD-characteristics. Increased sleep awareness combined with educational initiatives regarding sleep are advocated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Nicotine & Tobacco Research
AB  - Introduction: Maternal use of smoked tobacco during pregnancy causes significant morbidity and mortality in the human infant including alterations in autonomic control with increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. We hypothesized that maternal snus (smokeless tobacco) use during pregnancy affects autonomic cardiac regulation in the infant, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and the low frequency and high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio). Methods: A prospective observational study of 56 infants of women who used snus (n = 23) or cigarettes (n = 13) during pregnancy versus tobacco- and nicotine-free controls (n = 19). The nicotine dose was estimated by questionnaires at 4 timepoints pre- and post-natally. The infants’ urine cotinine concentration and HRV during 2 hours of sleep were studied 1–2 months after birth. Results: LF/HF ratio was higher in snus (mean 3.31; 95% CI 2.78–3.83) and smoke (3.51;2.54–4.47) compared to controls (2.15; 1.76–2.54, p = .002). Early prenatal nicotine exposure “without” any further exposure increased the LF/HF ratio (3.19; 2.55–3.84, p = .02). Continuous prenatal nicotine exposure “without” postnatal exposure was also associated with a residual increase in LF/HF ratio (4.40; 3.38–5.42, p < .001). There was no difference between infants exposed to smokeless versus smoked tobacco, suggesting a common constituent (nicotine) altering autonomic cardiac regulation. Conclusion: Infants to mothers who used snus during pregnancy showed lower vagal activity with an increased LF/HF ratio compared to controls, and similar to infants of smokers. Even early prenatal exposure to snus has a lasting impact on autonomic cardiac regulation suggesting a fetal “re-programing” of the developing autonomic nervous system. Implications: The results indicate that smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) affects the developing autonomic nervous system during gestation. Even if exposure is interrupted during the first or second trimester, effects in autonomic cardiac regulation are seen in the 1–2 month-old infant. This underlines the importance of abstaining from all types of tobacco use during the whole pregnancy. Our findings may also have more general relevance to other routes by which nicotine can be delivered to a fetus and newborn. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback
AB  - Anxiety about labor in women at the end of pregnancy sometimes reaches levels that are clinically concerning. We investigated whether low-risk pregnant women with childbirth fear during the last trimester demonstrate specific findings with regard to resting heart rate variability (HRV) and examined whether HRV biofeedback can reduce this fear and alter resting HRV. We measured the levels of childbirth fear (Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire, W-DEQ) and resting HRV indexes in 97 low-risk pregnant women in their 32nd–34th week of gestation and advised women with W-DEQ scores of ≥ 66 (n = 40) to practice HRV biofeedback (StressEraser) at home. We then reassessed these measures 3–4 weeks later in the 36th–37th week of gestation regardless of whether the women practiced the method. We found that childbirth fear had no significant effect on resting HRV indexes when the W-DEQ cutoff was conventionally set at ≥ 66. However, women with W-DEQ scores of ≥ 90 (n = 5) had a significantly lower high-frequency power than their counterparts (p = 0.028). The W-DEQ scores reduced significantly in women who performed HRV biofeedback (n = 18, p < 0.001), but there was no change in those who did not perform the method (n = 20). These findings suggested that very high W-DEQ scores (≥ 90), but not the conventional criteria (W-DEQ score ≥ 66), of the fear of childbirth were associated with low parasympathetic activity among low-risk pregnant women and that HRV biofeedback intervention can effectively decrease the fear of childbirth in these women.

AB  - Objectives: To examine oxidative & nitrosative stress (O & NS) biomarkers at the end of term in relation to perinatal affective symptoms, neuro-immune biomarkers and pregnancy-related outcome variables. Methods: We measured plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), -sulfhydryl (-SH), peroxides (LOOH) and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in pregnant women with and without prenatal depression and non-pregnant controls. Results: Pregnancy is accompanied by significantly increased AOPP and NOx, and lowered TRAP, -SH and LOOH. Increased O&NS and lowered LOOH and -SH levels are associated with prenatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal symptoms). Increased AOPP and NOx are significantly associated with lowered –SH, TRAP and zinc, and with increased haptoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. Increased O&NS and lowered TRAP and PON 1 activity, at the end of term predict mother (e.g. hyperpigmentation, labor duration, caesarian section, cord length, breast milk flow) and baby (e.g. sleep and feeding problems) outcome characteristics. Conclusions: Pregnancy is accompanied by interrelated signs of O&NS, lowered antioxidant defenses and activated neuro-immune pathways. Increased O&NS at the end of term is associated with perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms and may predict obstetric and behavioral complications in mother and baby.

TI  - Play therapy practices with children experiencing nightmares.
AU  - Armstrong, Deborah
T2  - Play-based interventions for childhood anxieties, fears, and phobias.
AB  - Evidence suggests that all humans experience nightmares, and most experience them regularly throughout their life. Most recently, Antti Revonsuo, a neuroscientist, developed the threat simulation theory that views nightmares as a kind of biological fire drill that ensures that our bodies are always on alert for dangers that may present themselves throughout the night when we are sleeping. Dreaming begins to take place sometime around the middle of the second trimester of pregnancy and is understood to contribute to the rapid progression of complex neural development that readies the fetus for survival and life outside of the womb. Newborns and infants spend far more time in REM sleep than at any other age. Sleep researchers agree that REM is strongly linked to establishing neural pathways in the brain and body. The following presents a smorgasbord of play therapy practices that I have discovered and developed through many sources and that can be used with children experiencing nightmares. These practices can be tweaked for considerations involving the child’s age, stage, and specific contextual considerations. Comments about some examples of these will be offered in the descriptions.

TI  - Cognitive performance as a function of sleep disturbance in the postpartum period.
AU  - Wilkerson, Allison K.
AB  - New mothers often complain of impaired cognitive functioning, and it is well documented that women experience a significant increase in sleep disturbance after the birth of a child. Sleep disturbance has been linked to impaired cognitive performance in several populations, including commercial truck drivers, airline pilots, and medical residents, though this relationship has rarely been studied in postpartum women. In the present study 13 pregnant women and a group of 22 non-pregnant controls completed one week of actigraphy followed by a battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires in the last month of pregnancy (Time 1) and again at four weeks postpartum (Time 2). Pregnant women experienced significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbance than the control group at both time points. They also demonstrated more impairment in objective, but not subjective cognitive functioning. Preliminary analyses indicated increased objective sleep fragmentation from Time 1 to Time 2 predicted decreased objective cognitive performance from Time 1 to Time 2, though small sample size limited the power of these findings. Implications for perinatal women and need for future research were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study of some of the characteristics of the female libido and of other features which are exclusive to the female inner world might help us to understand the aetiology of perversion in women. We might then see female perversions not as parallels to the psychopathology found in men, but as having their own separate and distinct causes. There is a dramatic difference in the sense of temporality in males and females. Women have a ‘biological clock’ that is present and evident from the moment they are born. From menarche to menopause, this clock dominates women's lifespan and subjects her to the hope/dread of pregnancy. This grounds women firmly in the reality principle. They not only have a different libidinal development from men but they also experience a sense of pressure provided by this inexorable marking of the passage of time which is exclusive to their sex and is intimately related to their reproductive functions.

AB  - To develop an animal model for studies on peri-partum sleep disorders, sleep patterns in female Wistar rats during pregnancy, post-partum and after weaning, were assessed and associated adaptive changes in their anxiety were examined. Adult nulliparous female rats, maintained in standard laboratory conditions with ad libitum food and water, were surgically implanted with electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes under anaesthesia for objective assessment of sleep-wakefulness (S-W). After post-surgical recovery, three control recordings of S-W were taken for 24h before the animals were kept for mating. After confirmation of pregnancy, S-W recordings were acquired during different days of pregnancy, post-partum lactation/nursing days, and also after weaning. Their anxiety levels were tested in the elevated plus maze. During pregnancy, sleep increased primarily due to increase in light non-REM sleep during dark period. There was an increase in non-REM sleep delta power after parturition, though the sleep was fragmented, especially during daytime. Simultaneous behavioural recording showed increased anxiety during third trimester of pregnancy and gradual reversal of it after parturition. This is the first report where diurnal and nocturnal variations in S-W and delta power, along with adaptive changes in anxiety, were studied before, during and after pregnancy. This study also provides an animal model for drug trials and studies on sleep disorders during peri-partum window. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is a serious public health problem as it can affect the health of pregnant women and newborns. However, it is not well studied whether sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy has similar effects on emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring, and if so, the potential cellular mechanisms also remain poorly understood. Methods: In the present study, the pregnant rats were subjected to sleep deprivation for 6 h per day by gentle handling during the first (gestational days 1–7), second (gestational days 8–14) and third trimester (gestational days 15–21) of pregnancy, respectively. The emotional and cognitive functions as well as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were tested in the offspring rats (postnatal days 42-56). Results: The offspring displayed impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, and increased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Quantification of BrdU-positive cells revealed that adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced compared to control. Electrophysiological recording showed that maternal sleep deprivation impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP and reduced basal synaptic transmission, as reflected by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that maternal sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy disrupts the emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring that might be attributable to the suppression of hippocampal LTP and basal synaptic transmission.

AB  - Objectives: Sleep problems and deprivation are common during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies are mostly descriptive or focused on specific clinical groups and late pregnancy. We aimed to identify sleep duration trajectories during the pregnancy period, their associated factors, and impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods: We studied 200 women from a mother–child cohort recruited in 2009–2011 from the French general population. We used semi-parametric models to analyze data collected through questionnaires. Results: We detected three sleep duration trajectories during pregnancy: short-decreasing ( 8 h/night, 31.6%) trajectories. Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13 [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working >28 weeks of gestational age (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10–0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e. cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion: We identified sleep trajectories among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal and child health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: To determine the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with overall sleep duration among pregnant women. Methods: Data from the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used. All women (n = 2951) of childbearing age (18–44 years) who were pregnant and responded to all fruit and vegetable consumption and sleep duration questions were included. Covariates included age, race, education level, exercise, and marital status. Data were analyzed using linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results: Total daily fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with sleep duration among pregnant women, controlling for confounders [β = −0.03, (−0.07, 0.00)]. Orange and green vegetable consumption were both inversely associated with sleep duration [β = −0.19, (−0.38, −0.01) and β = −0.20, (−0.33, −0.08) respectively]. Ordinal logistic regression found that the odds of meeting or exceeding sleep time recommendations increased slightly with each unit increase in total fruit and vegetable consumption [OR = 1.05 (1.003, 1.092)] and for every unit increase in fruit consumption [OR = 1.12 (1.038, 1.208)]. Women who exercised within the past 30 days reported approximately 20 min of additional sleep compared to those who did not [β = 0.32 (0.16, 0.49)]. Age, employment status, and marital status were also independently associated with sleep duration. Discussion: Sleep duration in pregnant women was associated with exercise and other demographic factors, but only mildly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Future research should investigate the effects of additional factors including sleep quality, gestational age, family status and other medications as potential confounders.

AB  - Background: Although stress during pregnancy has negative effects on children’s development and pregnant women’s health, no study has assessed stress and its predictors among pregnant Saudi women. The aim of this study was to assess stress and identify its predictors in a sample of pregnant Saudi women. Methods: A correlational study was carried out at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on 438 pregnant women who attended the obstetrics/gynecology clinic. We collected data on their sociodemographic and oral health status. Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results: The sample mean age was 30.6±5.4 years, and 33.4% of the sample reported high stress levels (PSS ≥20). The study revealed significantly high stress levels in women with no or low income, chronic disease, sleep deprivation, no teeth brushing, irregular eating patterns, gestational diabetes, and no family support (P P < 0.05). A multiple linear regression model showed that no teeth brushing, chronic disease, sleep deprivation, gestational diabetes, and gingival redness predicted an increase in stress by a score of 3.6, 2.4, 2.1, 1.4, and 1.4, respectively. Conclusion: It was estimated that three in ten pregnant women in King Abdulaziz Medical City reported high stress levels. Our study shed light on the relationship between healthy habits, oral health status, and perceived stress in pregnant women. This research may help health care practitioners who provide care to pregnant women, to educate them in regard to healthy habits, and to develop a program to reduce stress.

AB  - Prenatal psychosocial health has been linked with health behaviors, maternal health, and birth outcomes. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a prenatal depression intervention on birth outcomes and maternal physical and psychological status at 42 days postpartum. Three hundred fifty-two high-risk pregnant women exposed to obstetric complications with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) ≥ 9 or a Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) ≥ 60 were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 176) and control group (n = 176). The intervention group underwent a six-session couple-separated psycho-educational program; the control group received the usual care. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at late pregnancy (>28 weeks), 3 days postpartum, and 42 days postpartum. The intervention group had a significantly lower cesarean rate and shorter third stage of labor (p p < .05). A prenatal psychological intervention model for high-risk pregnant women holds potential as a preventive program that addresses maternal health and birth outcomes.

TI  - Perinatal programming of circadian clock-stress crosstalk.
AU  - Astiz, Mariana
AU  - Oster, Henrik
T2  - Neural Plasticity
AB  - An intact communication between circadian clocks and the stress system is important for maintaining physiological homeostasis under resting conditions and in response to external stimuli. There is accumulating evidence for a reciprocal interaction between both—from the systemic to the molecular level. Disruption of this interaction by external factors such as shiftwork, jetlag, or chronic stress increases the risk of developing metabolic, immune, or mood disorders. From experiments in rodents, we know that both systems maturate during the perinatal period. During that time, exogenous factors such as stress or alterations in the external photoperiod may critically affect—or program—physiological functions later in life. This developmental programming process has been attributed to maternal stress signals reaching the embryo, which lastingly change gene expression through the induction of epigenetic mechanisms. Despite the well-known function of the adult circadian system in temporal coordination of physiology and behavior, the role of maternal and embryonic circadian clocks during pregnancy and postnatal development is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the circadian-stress crosstalk at different periods of development may help to improve stress resistance and devise preventive and therapeutic strategies against chronic stress-associated disorders.

AB  - Sleep disorders are a common problem during pregnancy and may affect quality of life. This study aimed to determine the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life in Iranian pregnant women. This cross‐sectional study was conducted on 565 women recruited using 2‐stage cluster sampling methods. Data were collected using sociodemographic characteristics; quality of life; and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire between March and May 2015. About 6% of the women had a sleep disorder. There were significant correlations between quality of life and total score of sleep quality, subdomains of habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction. Paying attention to the sleep quality as an effective factor of quality of life can promote sleep quality and hence quality of life of pregnant women.

AB  - The letter presents a case report of a 34-year old man suffering from frequent complex partial seizures resistant to antiepileptic drugs.Hewas also affected by chronic hepatitis B and ulcerative colitis (UC) since age 24. Family history for epilepsy and febrile seizures was negative. The pregnancy was reportedly unremarkable; labor and delivery were at term and normal. The authors observed a clear modulation of myoclonus by NREM sleep, mostly after seizure. A boosting post-ictal effect similar to what occurs for IEAs could explain this finding. Alternatively, we might hypothesize a potential role of the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) during NREM sleep; the CAP has been demonstrated to play a gate-control on periodic limb movements during NREM sleep. In the same way, CAP could play a similar facilitating role for myoclonus in our patient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

This retrospective cohort study evaluates DST impact on pregnancy and pregnancy loss rates in 1,654 autologous in vitro fertilization cycles (2009 to 2012). Study groups were identified based on the relationship of DST to embryo transfer. Pregnancy rates were similar in Spring and Fall (41.4%, 42.2%). Pregnancy loss rates were also comparable between Spring and Fall (15.5%, 17.1%), but rates of loss were significantly higher in Spring when DST occurred after embryo transfer (24.3%). Loss was marked in patients with a history of prior spontaneous pregnancy loss (60.5%). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

The circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with sleep problems in previous studies. Here, we studied whether evening-type women had more sleep problems during their pregnancy, as compared with other chronotypes, in a sample consisting of 1653 pregnant women from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP Birth Cohort. Chronotype was assessed with a shortened version of the morningness–eveningness questionnaire. Pregnant evening-type women reported more sleep problems, including troubles of falling asleep (OR = 3.4, p p p p p p p p p p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. Our results indicate that eveningness is associated with more sleep problems and unhealthy life habits during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To analyze the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, psychological distress and sleep quality in pregnant women, and to examine the mediating effect of psychological distress between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality. Methods: Totally 213 pregnant women in second trimester were selected. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), and 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) were used to assess the sleep quality, prenatal maternal stress and psychological distress respectively. Results: The average scores of PSQI were (5.3 ± 2.5), and 41.3% of the subjects had sleep problems (PSQI > 5). PSRS scores were negatively correlated with PSQI scores and K10 scores (r = 0.57, 0.26, P r = 0.743, P P < 0.01) and did not include 0, which indicated that psychological distress significantly-mediated the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality. Conclusion: It suggests that pregnant women in second trimester have poor sleep quality. Prenatal maternal stress and psychological distress could affect sleep quality, and psychological distress could mediate the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality.

T2  - American Journal of Primatology
AB  - How nonhuman primates deal with birth, at the moment of delivery, and during the following days, remains poorly explored because of the unpredictability of this event, particularly for forest‐dwelling arboreal species. Available studies highlight intra‐ and interspecific variation which suggest flexibility of the timing of delivery, of behavior associated with labor contractions and parturition, and the social context and ambient noise surrounding delivery. Here, we present the findings of a two‐decade survey of reproduction in a population of captive Campbell's monkeys. Analysis of 34 births (with a female‐biased sex ratio) showed that deliveries occurred systematically at night and more frequently during week‐ends and in fall (September–November). This suggests the existence of both circadian and infradian biological rhythms. We present the first detailed description of a birth for this species and its short‐term social consequences. In line with previous findings for other monkeys and apes, labor (estimated by unusual stretching postures) and parturition were rapid, and delivery occurred in a clear social and vocal context. During the following days, the new mother became the center of attention of for young (kin and non‐kin) females and rose through the hierarchy. We discuss socio‐ecological factors, notably captivity conditions and the high degree of tolerance in the species’ social system, and confirm the existence of both “rigidity” and “flexibility” in the primates’ adaptive reproductive strategies.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the independent and combined associations of maternal self-reported poor sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation during the third trimester. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1298 pregnant women (between 24 and 28 gestational weeks) attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Multivariate logistical regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) after adjusting for putative confounders. Results: Approximately, 17% of women were classified as having poor sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of > 5 vs. ≤ 5). Further, the prevalence of antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively in this cohort. After adjusting for confounders including depression, poor sleep quality was associated with a 2.81-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.81; 95% CI 1.78–4.45). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 28% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.15–1.41). The odds of suicidal ideation was particularly high among depressed women with poor sleep quality (OR = 13.56 95% CI 7.53–24.41) as compared with women without either risk factor. Limitations: This cross-sectional study utilized self-reported data. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may not be fully generalizable. Conclusion: Poor sleep quality, even after adjusting for depression, is associated with antepartum suicidal ideation. Our findings support the need to explore sleep-focused interventions for pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The few existing early-life obesity prevention initiatives have concentrated on abstract nutrition and physical activity, with little examination of sleep. Methods: This community-based, randomized controlled trial allocated 802 pregnant women (≥ 16 years, P = .086), but there was an overall group effect for the prevalence of obesity (P = .027). Exploratory analyses found a protective effect for obesity among those receiving the “sleep intervention” (sleep and combination compared with FAB and control: odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.35–0.82]). No effect was observed for the “FAB intervention” (FAB and combination compared with sleep and control: odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.80–1.81]). Conclusions: A well-developed food and activity intervention did not seem to affect children’s weight status. However, further research on more intensive or longer running sleep interventions is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Daytime sleepiness is a frequent complaint in women during pregnancy. It has also been linked to negative obstetric consequences. Although high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness throughout pregnancy is well-documented, neither the causes of persistent daytime sleepiness nor new-onset daytime sleepiness during pregnancy have been investigated. Identifying predictive factors may play an important role in the management of daytime sleepiness in pregnant women and improve prenatal care and maternal-fetal outcomes. Objectives: To examine first-trimester maternal characteristics associated with the persistence and new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Design: A longitudinal, prospective cohort design. Setting: One medical center in Taipei, Taiwan and participating women’s homes. Participants: A total of 204 pregnant women. Methods: First-trimester pregnant women recruited from an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center provided socio-demographic and health information, wore an actigraphy monitor for 7 days, and completed sleep, mood, and daytime sleepiness questionnaires. Data were collected again when the women were in the second and third trimester. Results: Thirty-one (15.2%) women experienced excessive daytime sleepiness that persisted across all three trimesters. Nulliparous women and women who snored in the first trimester were 2.28 and 2.10 times more at risk of being classified of persistent daytime sleepiness than multiparous women and women who did not snore in the first trimester, respectively. Thirty-one (15.2%) women developed new-onset daytime sleepiness with advancing gestation. Women were more likely to develop new-onset daytime sleepiness if they worked longer hours per week (OR = 1.04, p p p = 0.01). Conclusions: Snoring in the first trimester is involved in both the persistence and new-onset of daytime sleepiness with elevated depressive symptoms related to new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Findings suggest that intervention strategies for alleviating daytime sleepiness in pregnant women should focus on managing snoring and symptoms of depression in early trimesters with special attention to nulliparous and employed women.

AB  - Background: Perinatal depression (PND) has an overall estimated prevalence of roughly 12 %. Untreated PND has significant negative consequences not only on the health of the mothers, but also on the physical, emotional and cognitive development of their children. No certain risk factors are known to predict PND and no completely safe drug treatments are available during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Sleep and depression are strongly related to each other because of a solid reciprocal causal relationship. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a well-tested and safe treatment, effective in both depression and circadian/sleep disorders. Methods: In a 3-year longitudinal, observational, multicentre study, about 500 women will be recruited and followed-up from early pregnancy (10–15 gestational week) until 12 months after delivery. The primary aim of the present study is to systematically explore and characterize risk factors for PND by prospective sleep assessment (using wrist actigraphy, polysomnography and various sleep questionnaires) and bloodbased analysis of potential markers during the perinatal period (Life-ON study). Secondary aims are to explore the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and PND (substudy Life-ON1), to investigate the effectiveness of BLT in treating PND (substudy Life-ON2) and to test whether a short term trial of BLT during pregnancy can prevent PND (substudy Life-ON3). Discussion: The characterization of specific predictive and risk factors for PND may substantially contribute to improve preventive medical and social strategies for the affected women. The study results are expected to promote a better understanding of the relationship between sleep disorders and the development of PND and to confirm, in a large sample of women, the safety and efficacy of BLT both in prevention and treatment of PND.

AB  - Background: Few studies have looked at the relationship between psychological and the mental health status of pregnant women in rural China. The current study aims to explore the potential mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts between negative life events and antenatal depression. Methods: Data were collected in June 2012 and October 2012. 495 rural pregnant women were interviewed. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, stresses of pregnancy were measured by the pregnancy pressure scale, negative automatic thoughts were measured by the automatic thoughts questionnaire, and negative life events were measured by the life events scale for pregnant women. We used logistic regression and path analysis to test the mediating effect. Results: The prevalence of antenatal depression was 13.7%. In the logistic regression, the only socio-demographic and health behavior factor significantly related to antenatal depression was sleep quality. Negative life events were not associated with depression in the fully adjusted model. Path analysis showed that the eventual direct and general effects of negative automatic thoughts were 0.39 and 0.51, which were larger than the effects of negative life events. Conclusions: This study suggested that there was a potentially significant mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts. Pregnant women who had lower scores of negative automatic thoughts were more likely to suffer less from negative life events which might lead to antenatal depression.

AB  - Study Objectives: To examine independent associations of sleep duration with total and abdominal adiposity, and the bidirectionality of these associations, in a young biethnic sample of children from a disadvantaged location. Methods: Child sleep duration (h/day) was parent-reported by questionnaire and indices of total (body weight, body mass index, percent body fat (%BF), sum of skinfolds) and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference) were measured using standard anthropometric procedures at approximately 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age in 1,338 children (58% South Asian; 42% White). Mixed effects models were used to quantify independent associations (expressed as standardised β-coefficients (95% confidence interval (CI)) of sleep duration with adiposity indices using data from all four time-points. Factors considered for adjustment in models included basic demographics, pregnancy and birth characteristics, and lifestyle behaviours. Results: With the exception of the sum of skinfolds, sleep duration was inversely and independently associated with indices of total and abdominal adiposity in South Asian children. For example, one standard deviation (SD) higher sleep duration was associated with reduced %BF by -0.029 (95% CI: −0.053, −0.0043) SDs. Higher adiposity was also independently associated with shorter sleep duration in South Asian children (for example, %BF: β = -0.10 (-0.16, -0.028) SDs). There were no significant associations in White children. Conclusions: Associations between sleep duration and adiposity are bidirectional and independent among South Asian children from a disadvantaged location. The results highlight the importance of considering adiposity as both a determinant of decreased sleep and a potential consequence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Study Objectives: To examine the influence of maternal sleep quality and nocturnal sleep duration on risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a multiethnic Asian population. Methods: A cohort of 686 women (376 Chinese, 186 Malay, and 124 Indian) with a singleton pregnancy attended a clinic visit at 26–28 weeks of gestation as part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes mother–offspring cohort study. Self-reported sleep quality and sleep duration were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). GDM was diagnosed based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test administered after an overnight fast (1999 WHO criteria). Multiple logistic regression was used to model separately the associations of poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5) and short nocturnal sleep duration (<6 h) with GDM, adjusting for age, ethnicity, maternal education, body mass index, previous history of GDM, and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score). Results: In the cohort 296 women (43.1%) had poor sleep quality and 77 women (11.2%) were categorized as short sleepers; 131 women (19.1%) were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality and short nocturnal sleep duration were independently associated with increased risk of GDM (poor sleep, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 2.76; short sleep, adjusted OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.66). Conclusions: During pregnancy, Asian women with poor sleep quality or short nocturnal sleep duration exhibited abnormal glucose regulation. Treating sleep problems and improving sleep behavior in pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk and burden of GDM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Pregnancy, particularly late gestation (LG), has been associated with a relatively high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of OSA, could impose significant long‐term effects on somatic growth, energy homeostasis, and metabolic function in offspring. We hypothesized that IH during late pregnancy (LG‐IH) may increase the propensity for metabolic dysregulation and obesity in adult offspring via epigenetic modifications. Time‐pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to LG‐IH or room air (LG‐RA) during days 13–18 of gestation. At 24 weeks, blood samples were collected from offspring mice for lipid profiles and insulin resistance, indirect calorimetry was performed and visceral white adipose tissues (VWAT) were assessed for inflammatory cells as well as for differentially methylated gene regions (DMRs) using a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on chip (MeDIP‐chip). Body weight, food intake, adiposity index, fasting insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol levels were all significantly higher in LG‐IH male but not female offspring. LG‐IH also altered metabolic expenditure and locomotor activities in male offspring, and increased number of pro‐inflammatory macrophages emerged in VWAT along with 1520 DMRs (P < 0.0001), associated with 693 genes. Pathway analyses showed that genes affected by LG‐IH were mainly associated with molecular processes related to metabolic regulation and inflammation. LG‐IH induces metabolic dysfunction as reflected by increased body weight and adiposity index in adult male offspring that is paralleled by epigenomic alterations and inflammation in VWAT. Thus, perturbations to fetal environment by OSA during pregnancy can have long‐term detrimental effects on the fetus, and lead to persistent metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

AB  - Postpartum psychosis has long-lasting consequences for mother and child. Beside depression, sleep and eating disturbances, exhaustion, social withdrawal, and anxiety, postpartum depression can also interfere with normal maternal-infant bonding and adversely affect child development. Recent reports show that most affected pregnant women are hesitant about taking antidepressant drugs, with a high percentage discontinuing their use. Some authors suggest that the reluctance of pregnant women to take antidepressant drugs should encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients the use of psychological interventions or alternative forms of treatment. In this article, a case of severe postpartum depression, treated successfully with homeopathic therapy, is presented. Considering the high noncompliance of women suffering from postpartum depression with conventional antidepressant medication, research in safe complementary medical methods is justified. One of these methods should be homeopathy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Women of child-bearing age are the population at greatest risk for depression. The stress experienced during pregnancy and the associated antidepressant treatments can both affect fetal development. Fluoxetine (FLX) is among the most common antidepressants used by pregnant women. We have previously demonstrated that perinatal exposure to FLX can alter expression of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Here, we examine the combined effects of maternal stress during pregnancy and perinatal exposure to the antidepressant FLX on the circadian behavior of mice as adults. Methods: Mouse dams were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (embryonic (E) day 7 to E18), FLX (E15 to postnatal day 12), a combination of both stress and FLX, or were left untreated. At 2 months of age, male offspring were placed in recording chambers and circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed. Results: Mice exposed to prenatal stress (PS) had smaller light-induced phase delays. Mice exposed to perinatal FLX required more days to re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance of their light–dark cycle. Mice subjected to either perinatal FLX or to PS had larger light-induced phase advances and smaller phase advances to 8-OH-DPAT. FLX treatment partially reversed the effect of PS on phase shifts to late-night light exposure and to 8-OH-DPAT. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, in mice, perinatal exposure to either FLX, or PS, or their combination, leads to discernible, persistent changes in their circadian systems as adults.

T2  - Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care
AB  - Background: Poor sleep during pregnancy has been associated with poorer birth outcomes. High body mass index (BMI) is often associated with poor sleep, but little is known about the relationship between gestational weight gain and sleep in late pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships of both gestational weight gain and pre‐pregnancy BMI to objective and subjective measures of sleep during late pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 128) were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth classes primarily serving low‐income women. Their sleep (disruption and duration) was objectively assessed in their last month of pregnancy with 72 hours of wrist actigraphy monitoring. Their perceived sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pre‐pregnancy and late pregnancy height and weight were assessed by self‐report and used to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain, which were then grouped into standardized categories. Results: Mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was 6.8 ± 3.1 (range 2–16). Sixty percent had excess gestational weight gain and it was associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, but was unrelated to objective measures of sleep duration and disruption. Pre‐pregnancy BMI was unrelated to all sleep parameters. However, analyses of the interaction of pre‐pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain indicated that excess weight gain was associated with shorter sleep duration and more sleep disruption, but only among women who were overweight before pregnancy. Conclusion: Pregnancy is an opportunity to promote long‐term women's health with a better understanding of the relationship between weight management and healthy sleep habits.

AB  - It was recently reported that pregnant women were more likely to have minor depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression scale (PHQ-8), (as reported by Kroenke and Spitzer (Psychiatr Ann 32(9):1–7, 2002), and Kroenke et al. (J Affect 114(1–3):163–173, 2009)) compared to women who were not pregnant (as reported by Ashley et al. (Arch Womens Ment Health 19(2):395–400, 2015)). The present study is designed to investigate if somatic symptoms (energy level, appetite, sleep) associated with both pregnancy and depression were responsible for this increased prevalence of minor depression. A sample of pregnant women (n = 404) was compared to women who were not pregnant (n = 6754). Both groups scored within the minor depression range on the PHQ-8 and comparisons were based on participants’ responses to PHQ-8 items. Results indicate that of the somatic symptoms of depression, only changes in energy level accounted for the elevated prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant. Removing the decreased energy item from the score determination reduces the prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women to a level significantly below that of women who are not pregnant. Emotional symptoms such as feeling down and feeling like a failure were less likely to be reported by pregnant women compared to women who were not pregnant. Implications for depression screening during pregnancy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug in the world. Natural sources of caffeine include coffee, tea, and chocolate. Synthetic caffeine is also added to products to promote arousal, alertness, energy, and elevated mood. Over the past decade, the introduction of new caffeine-containing food products, as well as changes in consumption patterns of the more traditional sources of caffeine, has increased scrutiny by health authorities and regulatory bodies about the overall consumption of caffeine and its potential cumulative effects on behavior and physiology. Of particular concern is the rate of caffeine intake among populations potentially vulnerable to the negative effects of caffeine consumption: pregnant and lactating women, children and adolescents, young adults, and people with underlying heart or other health conditions, such as mental illness. Here, we review the research into the safety and safe doses of ingested caffeine in healthy and in vulnerable populations. We report that, for healthy adults, caffeine consumption is relatively safe, but that for some vulnerable populations, caffeine consumption could be harmful, including impairments in cardiovascular function, sleep, and substance use. We also identified several gaps in the literature on which we based recommendations for the future of caffeine research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Child and Family Studies
AB  - This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of parenting interventions on parent, infant and parent-infant relationship outcome measures for parents of infants under 12 months old. Parent outcomes examined included competence, and confidence; baby outcomes included infant behaviours of crying, settling, and sleeping problems and parent-infant relationship outcomes included parental responsiveness. Systematic searches of five databases were carried out. In total, 36 randomised controlled trials over the past 35 years were included in the meta-analyses, with a total of 4880 participants. Interventions were carried out either during pregnancy or within the first 12 months after birth and involved teaching specific strategies and provision of information on infant development and behaviour. Mean effect sizes were obtained using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was found on parent responsiveness and infant sleep. Potential moderator variables were assessed for these two outcomes using the SEM approach. Results showed that early parenting interventions are effective in improving parental responsiveness (d = 0.77), and improving or preventing infant sleep problems (d = 0.24), but not crying problems (d = 0.27) possibly due to low power. No conclusions could be drawn in regards to parental competence or confidence. Moderator analysis showed that for interventions aimed at improving responsiveness, briefer interventions were more effective than longer ones; and studies published more recently reported smaller effects than older studies. No other moderators influenced the assessed intervention outcomes. The findings of this study provide further evidence for the positive effects of early parenting interventions for infants under 12 months of age, however future research is needed to assess intervention effects on parental competence and confidence.

T2  - Maternal and Child Health Journal
AB  - Objectives: Infant developmental outcomes may be influenced by a range of prenatal maternal characteristics. While there is some evidence to suggest that maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, there is a need to systematically review this evidence to guide future research and clinical practice. Methods: Five electronic databases were systematically scanned. Key journals and reference lists were hand-searched. Papers were included if: (1) pregnant women were assessed for maternal-foetal attachment; (2) the infants were later assessed, under 2 years old, for any developmental outcome (e.g., social-emotional, cognition, motor, language, adaptive behaviour); and (3) they were published in English. Two independent reviewers used the STROBE checklist to appraise the quality of each paper. Results: Of the 968 papers identified, eight were included in the review, and four of these were of low quality (< 60 %) based on the STROBE. The developmental domains that were examined included: infant temperament (n = 5), adaptive behaviour (e.g., colic, sleep) (n = 2), and milestone attainment (n = 1). There is some evidence to suggest that lower maternal-foetal attachment is related to suboptimal developmental outcomes. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited and low quality studies available. Conclusions: Although maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, future research is required which: (1) considers a range of developmental outcomes, (2) has increased scientific rigour, (3) assesses mother-infant dyads at different prenatal and postnatal time points, and (4) examines different target populations.

AB  - Purpose: A population at great risk is pregnant homeless adolescents and young adult women. Research shows that about 20% of homeless young women become pregnant (Bender, & Thompson, 2007). These pregnant young women are at an increased risk for low birth weight infants and a high infant mortality due to inadequate health care, poor dietary habits, and a knowledge deficit related to maintaining good health during pregnancy and to care of the infant and growing child. A transitional shelter may offer many psychosocial services to assist the women in becoming independent; however, a significant gap exists regarding the medical care of this population. The purpose of this DNP Project was to develop an educational program in a transitional homeless shelter focused on the health care of the pregnant woman and the newborn infant in order to bring awareness of the special needs of this high risk population and to attempt to change unhealthy behaviors. This program was coupled with an In- Service Program for staff members related to Best Practices for the Mother- Infant Dyad. Significance of the project: Knowledge can be empowering and save lives. Through months of interaction and time spent with new mothers in a transitional shelter, the enormous lack of evidence based practices in regards to infant and child care has become evident. This vulnerable population has the highest rate of infant mortality. Education can improve the health outcomes of these women and children. These mothers are eager to learn and want to give their children a chance for a healthy life. They are lacking the information to do so. Methods: The project was implemented in a transitional homeless shelter for women ages 18 to 23 based on a needs assessment. The project implementation contained two parts. Informal education sessions took place with pregnant women and women having recently given birth. 10 Education Intervention Program There were both individual and group sessions. The topics included labor and delivery preparation, diet during pregnancy, care of the newborn, and safety issues related to sleep and feedings. As the infants have grown over the months the sessions have evolved to meet the needs of the growing infant and child. The second part of the project contains a series of learning modules comprising of four hours of narrated lectures and power point presentations developed for the staff. Project Outcomes: The project initiatives were received by all involved wholeheartedly. The project brought to the shelter directors and staff members a new awareness of the crucial need for evidenced based practice in the care of the newborn and mother. Clinical observations have shown a readiness for several of the mothers to follow lessons learned. Significant changes in behaviors related to care of the infant have been observed. A level of trust has developed between the educator and the residents of the shelter. The educator has assumed the role of advocate and mentor. Clinical Relevance: Women head up 90 percent of the families that use shelters. A third of the homeless are women and children, and the numbers are exploding. Through education, advocacy and developing a means of quality health care the lives of these women and children will be made better and healthier. A best practice model for care of the pregnant homeless women and her infant is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Maternal salivary cortisone to cortisol ratio in late pregnancy: An improved method for predicting offspring birth weight.
AU  - Wilson, Meredith
AU  - Thayer, Zaneta
T2  - Psychoneuroendocrinology
AB  - Overexposure to maternal cortisol in utero has been associated with lower birth weight of offspring. In order to regulate fetal exposure to this hormone, placental expression of 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2, an enzyme that converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone, increases across pregnancy. Because of this increase in 11-βHSD2 activity, measuring maternal cortisol in isolation may not reflect actual fetal exposure to the hormone. Previous work by Hellgren et al. (2016) has shown that maternal serum cortisone:cortisol ratio was a better predictor of offspring birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This paper sought to replicate these results when examining maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio. Data come from 55 pregnant women from Auckland, New Zealand. Cortisol and cortisone were measured in saliva samples collected at waking and prior to going to sleep on two consecutive weekdays between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation. We found that salivary cortisol and cortisone followed the expected diurnal rhythm and that cortisone was higher than cortisol at both times of day. Maternal bedtime cortisone:cortisol ratio was significantly and inversely related to offspring birth weight. However, waking and bedtime cortisol, as well as waking cortisone:cortisol ratio, were unrelated to birth weight. These results show that maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio, like serum cortisone:cortisol ratio, is a more sensitive biomarker for predicting infant birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This ratio could be a valuable, minimally-invasive measurement for future studies interested in understanding the relationship between maternal HPA-axis function and offspring birth weight.

AB  - Purpose: To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity. Method: We reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Results: Three broad study categories of medical comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Conclusions: BED is associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

AB  - Study objectives: Maternal and paternal sleep insufficiency during pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for health and wellbeing in young families. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress. Methods: The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night. Results: We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8% vs. 6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5% vs. 9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6–5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8–5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men. Conclusions: The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.

AB  - Executive function deficits are among the most frequent sequela of very preterm birth but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep to assess alterations in the functional neuroanatomy of executive processes in adolescents born very preterm. The topographical distribution of sleep slow wave activity (SWA; 1–4.5 Hz EEG power) has previously been used to map cognitive abilities and is known to reflect the intensity of the prior use of the respective neuronal networks. We assessed 38 adolescents born before 32 weeks of gestation [age at assessment: 12.9 (SD: 1.7), range: 10.6–16.7 years] and 43 term-born peers [13.1 (2.0), 10.0–16.9]. Executive function abilities were quantified with a composite score derived from a comprehensive task battery. All-night high-density EEG (128 electrodes) was recorded and SWA of the first hour of sleep was calculated. Abilities were significantly poorer in the very preterm compared to the term-group, particularly, if the tasks demands were high (p p = .02). No difference in SWA between very preterm and term-born participants was found for the central cluster (p = .29). Our results demonstrate a local increase of sleep SWA over brain regions associated with executive processes in adolescents born very preterm compared to similarly performing term-born peers. Thus, sleep SWA seems to map the higher effort needed for executive function tasks in adolescents born very preterm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Depression affects up to 23% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse physical/mental health outcomes for both the mother and baby. Depressed pregnant women may be more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to an increased risk for chronic disease. Little is known regarding depressed pregnant women’s perceptions, uses of, and interests in complementary health approaches. Study participants (mean age 28.7 ± 6.8; n = 1032) included pregnant women ≥ 8 weeks gestation who responded to a survey assessing physical and mental health and wellness practices. Of those completing the survey, depressed pregnant women (n = 272) had significantly higher levels of anxiety (P P P P P < .001) compared to nondepressed pregnant women (n = 760). A majority (84%) of depressed pregnant women would consider using a complementary health approach for weight and/or stress management during pregnancy, and more than 50% were interested in yoga.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the associations of perceived financial satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive symptoms in an unselected pregnant population in early pregnancy. Methods: 750 consecutive pregnant women attending the first communal ultrasound examination before gestational week 14 were invited to participate. Questionnaires assessing HRQoL (15D), depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale, EPDS), medical, obstetric, and socioeconomic status were handed out. The participants were divided into three groups according to their satisfaction with their financial status, (unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, and satisfied). Main outcome measures were 15D and EPDS-scores and dimensions of HRQoL. Results: 325 (43,3%) questionnaires were returned. The mean 15D-score for HRQoL was 0,926 (SD 0,056). The financially unsatisfied women had lower HRQoL than women in more satisfied groups (0.906, 0.923 and 0.931, p = 0.012). The result remained significant, even after adjusting for age and education(p = 0.032). The unsatisfied women had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (25.4, 24.4 and 23.2 kg/m², p for linearity = 0.002), were more often smokers, (13 vs. 4 and 3%, p = 0.029), and had experienced at least one abortion (18, 14 and 7%, p = 0.017). Dimensions of depression, distress and sleep explained the differences between the groups. 27% of unsatisfied women scored EPDS ≥ 10 points suggesting increased risk of depression. Conclusions: Financial satisfaction in early pregnancy associates with HRQoL and risk of perinatal depressive symptoms. Unsatisfied women more often have risk factors for unfavourable pregnancy outcomes which may influence the later health and wellbeing of the mother and child.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a common neurological sensorimotor disorder in western countries, has gained more and more attention in Asian countries. The prevalence of RLS is higher in older people and females. RLS is most commonly related to iron deficiency, pregnancy and uremia. The RLS symptoms show a significant circadian rhythm and a close relationship to periodic limb movements (PLMs) in clinical observations, while the pathophysiological pathways are still unknown. The diagnostic criteria have been revised in 2012 to improve the validity of RLS diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested an important role of iron decrease of brain in RLS pathophysiology. Dopaminergic (DA) system dysfunction in A11 cell groups has been recognized long ago from clinical treatment and autopsy. Nowadays, it is believed that iron dysfunction can affect DA system from different pathways and opioids have a protective effect on DA system. Several susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms such as BTBD9 and MEIS1, which are thought to be involved in embryonic neuronal development, have been reported to be associated with RLS. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment are discussed in this review. First-line treatments of RLS include DA agents and α2δ agonists. Augmentation is very common in long-term treatment of RLS which makes prevention and management of augmentation very important for RLS patients. A combination of different types of medication is effective in preventing and treating augmentation. The knowledge on RLS is still limited, the pathophysiology and better management of RLS remain to be discovered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with increased risk for mental health problems both in early adolescence and in adulthood. However, in late adolescence, when circadian rhythm naturally shifts to later, its significance for mental health is not clear. Accordingly, we studied how circadian rhythm estimated both by self-reported chronotype and by actigraph-defined midpoint of sleep was associated with self-reported psychiatric problems based on Youth Self Report (YSR). The study builds on a community cohort born in 1998, Helsinki, Finland. At age 17 years (mean age = 16.9, SD = 0.1 years), 183 adolescents (65.6% of the invited) participated in the study. We used the shortened version of the Horne-Östberg morningness–eveningness Questionnaire to define the chronotype, and actigraphs to define the naturally occur circadian rhythm over a 4 to 17 days’ period (mean nights N = 8.3, SD = 1.8). The Achenbach software was used to obtain T-score values for YSR psychiatric problem scales. The analyses were adjusted for important covariates including gender, socioeconomic status, body mass index, pubertal maturation, mother’s licorice consumption during pregnancy, and actigraph-defined sleep duration and quality. Eveningness was associated with higher scores in rule-breaking behavior and conduct problems (as assessed either by midpoint of sleep or by self-reported chronotype, p-values < 0.05), attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (by self-reported chronotype, p-values < 0.05), with affective problems (by midpoint of sleep and by self-reported chronotype, p-values < 0.05) and somatic complaints (by self-reported chronotype, p-values < 0.05), as compared to circadian tendency toward morningness. Our results suggest that the association between eveningness and externalizing problem behavior, present in children and younger adolescents, is also present in late adolescence when circadian rhythms shift toward evening.

AB  - Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal wellbeing. In acute hypoxaemia, the human fetus adapts to a lower oxygen consuming state with changes in the cardiotocograph and reduced fetal activity. Recent studies of late gestation stillbirth described the importance of sleep position in the risk of intrauterine death. We designed this study to assess the effects of different maternal positions on FBS in healthy late gestation pregnancies under controlled conditions. Twenty‐nine healthy women had continuous fetal ECG recordings under standardized conditions in four randomly allocated positions, left lateral, right lateral, supine and semi‐recumbent. Two blinded observers, assigned fetal states in 5 min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate variability were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Compared to state 2F, state 4F was less likely to occur when women were semi‐recumbent [odds ratio (OR) = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.02, 0.55], and supine (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.07, 1.10). State 1F was more likely on the right (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.11, 5.04) or supine (OR = 4.99, 95% CI 2.41, 10.43) compared to the left. State change was more likely when the mother was semi‐recumbent (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.19, 3.95) or supine (OR = 2.67, 95% CI 1.46, 4.85). There was a significant association of maternal position to mean fetal heart rate. The measures of heart rate variability (SDNN and RMSSD) were reduced in both semi‐recumbent and supine positions. In healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are likely fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.

T2  - The treatment of bipolar disorder: Integrative clinical strategies and future directions.
AB  - Sex-specific effects in the clinical presentation and course of bipolar disorder (BD) in women have important treatment implications for the management of symptoms across the menstrual cycle and reproductive lifespan. Women differ from men in the age of onset, clinical pattern of symptoms, and rates and types of psychiatric co-morbidities. For many women with BD, periods of hormonal fluctuation appear to present a unique risk for affective symptoms, thus making treatment challenging. Women with BD compared to without are particularly vulnerable to premenstrual mood symptoms, menstrual abnormalities, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Treatments may involve both psychotropic and gynecological expertise, and patients benefit from collaborative care among their specialist providers. Management of BD in the perinatal period entails many complex decisions. The postpartum period in particular is a time of greatly elevated risk for mood episodes. Use of psychotropic medication in pregnancy and lactation requires a careful risk-benefit analysis for each patient. While maintenance of mood stability is the primary goal, medications must be carefully selected to minimize risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes. Behavioural and social interventions should be targeted to minimize stress and prioritize optimal sleep and regular habits. Lastly, women with BD may be at risk for a worsening illness course during the menopausal transition. Pharmacological approaches to mood stabilization are not greatly different in this population, but the elevated risk for sleep impairments should be recognized and any disruption promptly treated.

AB  - Objectives: Whether racial/ethnic differences in prevalence/reporting of sleep disorders exist in pregnant women/women of child-bearing age is unknown. Study objectives were to estimate prevalence of sleep disorders and to examine racial/ethnic differences in sleep disorders, reporting of sleep issues, and amount of sleep among women of child-bearing age (15–44 years) in the US. Methods: Through a secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2010 (3175 non-pregnant, 432 pregnant women in main analysis), prevalence of sleep disorders, reporting of sleep disorders to a physician/health professional, and amount of sleep were estimated overall, by pregnancy status, and by race/ethnicity stratified by pregnancy status. Racial/ethnic differences in reporting of trouble sleeping by pregnancy status were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among women of childbearing age was 4.9 % [3.9 % pregnant; 5.1 % non-pregnant (p p < 0.05). Among non-pregnant women, odds of report of trouble sleeping were significantly higher for white compared to black (aOR 0.47 [95 % CI 0.36, 0.61]) or Mexican-American women (aOR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.21, 0.41]); non-pregnant minority women were also significantly less likely to report trouble sleeping than white women when controlling for amount of sleep. Among pregnant women, these same trends were found. Discussion: Compared to white women, minority women, despite reporting less adequate sleep, are less likely to report trouble sleeping, providing evidence of an important health disparity.

AB  - Aims: A longitudinal birth cohort provides an opportunity to study the impact of childhood conditions persisting into adulthood. This study examines the cross-sectional association of asthma with sleep quality and snoring in the adolescent and young adult population and the extent to which asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years independently predict themselves or each other at 21 years. Methods: Data from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children recruited into the Mater–University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223). Complete asthma and sleep information (questionnaire data) was available for 5015 participants at 14 years and 3527 at 21 years, with 3237 participants at both 14 and 21 years. Results: Poor sleep quality and snoring were independently associated with asthma at 14 years and 21 years, with stronger associations evident in women. At 21 years, associations were mediated by asthma symptom severity. Asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years each strongly and independently predicted themselves at 21 years. Asthma at 14 years predicted snoring at 21 years, while poor sleep quality and snoring in women predicted asthma at 21 years, the latter partially mediated by body mass index. Conclusions: The relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring varied by gender. Sleep quality and snoring should be considered in the assessment and holistic management of asthma. The predictive relationship seen between 14 and 21 years provides an opportunity to address these issues at a younger age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent studies have shown associations between maternal obesity at pre- or early pregnancy and long-term neurodevelopment in children, suggesting in utero effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain development. In this study, we examined whether brain functional connectivity to the prefrontal lobe network is different in newborns from normal-weight or obese mothers. Thirty-four full-term healthy infants from uncomplicated pregnancies were included, with 18 born to normal-weight and 16 born to obese mothers. Two weeks after delivery, the infants underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination during natural sleep, which included structural imaging and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scans. Independent component analysis was used to identify the prefrontal lobe network, and dual regression was used to compare functional connectivity between groups. Infants born to normal-weight mothers had higher recruiting (P P in utero may be associated with changes in resting-state functional connectivity in the newborn offspring’s brain.

AB  - Background: Depression during pregnancy is a common and high impact disease. Generally, 5–10 % of pregnant women suffer from depression. Children who have been exposed to maternal depression during pregnancy have a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes and more often show cognitive, emotional and behavioural problems. Therefore, early detection and treatment of antepartum depression is necessary. Both psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, first choice treatments in a non-pregnant population, have limitations in treating depression during pregnancy. Therefore, it is urgent and relevant to investigate alternative treatments for antepartum depression. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a promising treatment for pregnant women with depressive disorder, for it combines direct availability, sufficient efficacy, low costs and high safety, taking the safety for the unborn child into account as well. Methods: In this study, 150 pregnant women (12–18 weeks pregnant) with a DSM-V diagnosis of depressive disorder will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms: treatment with BLT (9.000 lux) or treatment with dim red light therapy (100 lux). Both groups will be treated for 6 weeks at home on a daily basis for 30 min, within 30 min of habitual wake-up time. Follow-up will take place after 6 weeks of therapy, 3 and 10 weeks after end of therapy, at birth and 2, 6 and 18 months postpartum. Primary outcome will be the average change in depressive symptoms between the two groups, as measured by the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale—Seasonal Affective Disorder version and the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale. Changes in rating scale scores of these questionnaires over time will be analysed using generalized linear mixed models. Secondary outcomes will be the changes in maternal cortisol and melatonin levels, in maternal sleep quality and gestational age, birth weight, infant behaviour, infant cortisol exposure and infant cortisol stress response. Discussion: If BLT reduces depressive symptoms in pregnant women, it will provide a safe, cheap, non-pharmacological and efficacious alternative treatment for psychotherapy and antidepressant medication in treating antepartum depression, without any expected adverse reactions for the unborn child.

AB  - Pregnancy is a time characterized by vast hormonal and physiologic changes. The dramatic increase in estrogen and progesterone impacts sleep architecture and produces systemic effects that may disrupt sleep. As pregnancy progresses, women experience a progressive increase in both the number and duration of nocturnal awakenings. The awakenings arise from a myriad of causes, including nocturia, nausea, heartburn, pain, and anxiety. Short sleep duration and poor quality sleep during pregnancy have been associated with a multitude of adverse outcomes, including maternal depression, gestational diabetes, prolonged labors, higher rate of cesarean deliveries, preterm birth, and low-birth-weight infants. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are two of the most common sleep disorders during pregnancy. Both of these disorders may cause significant sleep disruption and daytime fatigue. RLS has been associated with an increased risk for maternal depression, preeclampsia, and need for cesarean delivery. Treatment of RLS during pregnancy is focused on repletion of iron stores, elimination of factors that may exacerbate RLS, and management of symptoms with behavioral techniques. SDB may increase the risk for intrauterine growth retardation, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and preeclampsia. CPAP has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for treatment of SDB during pregnancy. By optimizing sleep hygiene, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy, and employing measures to reduce discomfort, heartburn, and nocturia, clinicians may improve a woman’s sleep. Due to concerns of risk to the fetus, pharmacologic treatment of insomnia during pregnancy is reserved for women with severe symptoms refractory to conservative measures.

T2  - Preventive Medicine: An International Journal Devoted to Practice and Theory
AB  - Preconception health refers to the health of males and females at any point in time prior to a potential pregnancy. A goal of preconception health research is to use preventive behaviour and healthcare to optimize the health of future offspring that result from both planned and unplanned pregnancies. This paper briefly reviews evidence of the importance of various preconception health behaviours, and examines the extent to which specific preconception health behaviours have been included in recent studies of such knowledge, behaviours, and intentions. To describe this recent research in highly developed countries, a scoping review of the literature was completed of studies published within the past seven years. A total of 94 studies on preconception health were identified and reviewed: (a) 15 examined knowledge and attitudes, (b) 68 studied behaviours, (c) 18 examined interventions designed to improve knowledge or behaviour, and (d) no studies examined intentions to engage in preconception health behaviours. Over 40% of studies examining preconception health behaviour focussed exclusively on folic acid. Overall, folic acid, alcohol, and cigarettes have consistently been topics of focus, while exposure to harmful environmental substances, stress, and sleep have been largely neglected. Despite strong evidence for the importance of men's health during the preconception period, only 11% of all studies included male participants. Based on existing gaps in the research, recommendations are provided, such as including men in future research, assessing a wider variety of behaviours, consideration of behavioural intentions, and consideration of the relationships between preconception health knowledge, intentions, and behaviour.

AB  - Background: Prenatal maternal obesity has been linked to adverse childhood neuropsychiatric outcomes, including increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing and externalizing problems, affective disorders and neurodevelopmental problems but few studies have studied neuropsychiatric outcomes among offspring born to very severely obese women or assessed potential familial confounding by maternal psychological distress. Method: We evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms in 112 children aged 3–5 years whose mothers had participated in a longitudinal study of obesity in pregnancy (50 very severe obesity, BMI ⩾ 40 kg/m², obese class III and 62 lean, BMI 18.5–25 kg/m²). The mothers completed the Conners’ Hyperactivity Scale, Early Symptomatic Syndrome Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examination Questionnaire (ESSENCE-Q), Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess child neuropsychiatric symptoms. Covariates included child's sex, age, birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age, parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), respectively. Results: Children exposed to prenatal maternal very severe obesity had significantly higher scores in the Conners’ Hyperactivity Scale; ESSENCE-Q; total sleep problems in CSHQ; hyperactivity, conduct problems and total difficulties scales of the SDQ; higher externalizing and total problems, anxious/depressed, aggressive behaviour and other problem syndrome scores and higher DSM-oriented affective, anxiety and ADHD problems in CBCL. Prenatal maternal very severe obesity remained a significant predictor of child neuropsychiatric problems across multiple scales independent of demographic factors, prenatal factors and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Prenatal maternal very severe obesity is a strong predictor of increased neuropsychiatric problems in early childhood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We evaluated the psychometric properties of a Mandarin Chinese version of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire‐10 (FOSQ‐10) in pregnant women. A total of 228 first‐trimester pregnant women participated in the study, which was conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .85), adequate corrected item‐total correlations (from .40 to .67), and acceptable test–retest reliability over 7 days (ICC = .73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a one‐factor structure with item loadings between .49 and .77. Significant associations with the Medical Outcomes Study Short‐Form Health Survey 12 version 2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index supported criterion‐related and convergent validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 total scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Ceiling effects were observed for all items, but no floor or ceiling effects were found for total scores. Findings suggest that the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 is a valid and reliable instrument to identify important effects of sleep‐related impairment in Chinese women during pregnancy. Further testing is needed in more diverse pregnant women, such as women with complicated pregnancies and those with sleep disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by Liora Kempler et al. (see record 2016-41488-003). Kempler et al.'s study confirms that high level evidence does not support the application of first wave behavioral (FWB) approaches to parent-infant sleep, particularly in the first six months of life. Douglas and Hill's findings suggest that FWB approaches may be detrimental to some families. Yet application of these interventions is widespread: even senior figures claim that not using them may be unethical, placing health professionals and parents under pressure to comply. Clearly a paradigm shift is required in the management of parent-infant sleep problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

Posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a serious potentially debilitating condition that affects men, women, and children. Although the disorder is now categorized in the DSM-5 as separate from anxiety disorders, the mission of the ADAA is to educate the public and professional community about accurate information that enhances the understanding and ability to treat and someday prevent PTSD. This month, Depression and Anxiety focuses on PTSD. Eleven peer-reviewed articles from experts in the field cover a wide variety of topics on PTSD. The issue include studies of symptoms in pregnancy and early postpartum, combat veterans and other soldiers, children who have experienced sexual abuse and other forms of maltreatment, as well as outcome of comorbid PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD) following electroconvulsive therapy, sleep and treatment outcome, and more.

The authors examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between sleep and health-related quality of life in 164 pregnant women. Subjects completed standard questionnaires on sleep, namely the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the health-related quality of life scale and wore a wrist actigraphy, named Actiwatch-21, for 7 days each trimester. In this longitudinal study, the first-trimester actigraphic total night time sleep and subjective sleep quality significantly predicted mental health-related quality of life in the second and third trimester. In addition, the first-trimester subjective sleep quality significantly predicted physical health-related quality of life in the second trimester. Author has some queries on Tsai et al’s study. Tsai et al. should have presented coefficients of determination (adjusted R-squared) in their multiple linear regression analysis to predict health-related quality of life. Health-related quality of life will have been determined by many factors including sleep parameters. The contribution of independent variables in their multivariate statistical model is important.

AB  - Background: Transition to parenthood is challenging but for women with a history of recurrent psychiatric disorders becoming a mother has a number of additional issues. Women with a history of mood disorders or psychoses are at increased risk for exacerbation in the vulnerable postpartum period and fear the potential risk of medication during pregnancy for the unborn child as much as they fear a relapse. In these difficult situations women and their families seek advice and support from mental health providers and obstetricians. Methods and results: Based on the treatment of 420 mentally ill women with a desire to have children and pregnancy and prospective documentation of 196 pregnancies over the last 10 years (2006–2016) the authors developed the Bonn concept of peripartum management (BKPM). The plan was designed to reduce the incidence and severity of postpartum relapses in women suffering from psychiatric disorders. Factors to be considered include antenatal and postpartum medication as well as reduction of stress and stimuli, sleep preservation, social support and help from the partner in caring for the baby. Of the 196 women in the BKPM only 4.6 % (n = 9) experienced a severe postpartum relapse with hospitalization. Additionally, the informed consent discussion with patient and partner as part of the peripartum management plan showed positive effects on how women and their families experienced autonomy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. Discussion: Careful planning and monitoring with a structured perinatal management plan can reduce the risk of relapse in the perinatal period and thus support women with a history of mental disorder in the transition to motherhood. Therefore, the management concept employed in Bonn contributes to the major goal of current peripartum psychiatric care in developing effective prevention strategies for women at high risk.

AB  - Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Pamela S. Douglas (see record 2016-41488-013) on the original article (see record 2016-41488-003). The results of the meta-analysis, and that of the previous Douglas and Hill both report that there is an effect of sleep-based interventions on maternal reports of infant total sleep time. However, the Douglas and Hill review nonetheless concludes that there is not strong evidence to support the use of these programs with infants, which is again implied by the title of her recent letter. Hence, while the results of the two reviews are similar, we maintain that the conclusions differ. The meta-analysis found no evidence from randomized controlled trials of potential harm associated with the sleep-based interventions included in the meta-analysis. Indeed, in terms of maternal mood, our meta-analysis showed a significant positive impact of these interventions. However, the fail-safe n indicated that this finding could be due to publication bias and should be interpreted cautiously. However, the meta-analysis is clear that, if there is an impact on maternal mood is improved following such programs, the impact is for mothers to report fewer depressive symptoms following sleep interventions. There is no evidence that mothers report more depression following these programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the incidence of adverse prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal experiences amongst children with anxiety disorders, and the relationship to clinical symptomology and functional impairment in treatment-seeking children (N = 107) with a primary anxiety disorder. Anxious children had higher rates of reported maternal prescription medication use during pregnancy, maternal smoking and illness during pregnancy and neonatal complications (including neonatal intensive care and feeding issues) compared with population base rates and non-affected children. Almost one-third had early problems with sleep. Developmental problems were common with more than half having at least one area of delay. More than three quarters of anxious children had a first-degree family member with a psychiatric history. There were several associations between neonatal complications and subsequent clinical symptomology, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depressive comorbidity, anxiety severity and functional impairment. Findings suggest higher rates of perinatal complications in anxious children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Our goal was to examine associations of infant sleep and feeding patterns with maternal sleep and mood among women at risk for postpartum depression. Participants were 30 women (age ± SD = 28.3 ± 5.1 years) with a history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) who completed daily sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs to estimate sleep, and had their mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) during four separate weeks of the perinatal period (33 weeks pregnancy and weeks 2, 6, and 16 postpartum). They logged their infants’ sleep and feeding behaviors daily and reported postnatal stress on the Childcare Stress Inventory (CSI) at week 16. Mothers’ actigraphically estimated sleep showed associations with infant sleep and feeding patterns only at postpartum week 2. Shorter duration of the longest infant-sleep bout was associated with shorter maternal sleep duration (p = .02) and lower sleep efficiency (p = .04), and maternal sleep efficiency was negatively associated with the number of infant-sleep bouts (p = .008) and duration of infant feeding (p = .008). Neither infant sleep nor feeding was associated with maternal sleep at 6 or 16 weeks, but more disturbed infant sleep and more frequent feeding at 6 weeks were associated with higher HAM-D scores at 6 and 16 weeks and higher CSI scores. Sleep in the mother-infant dyad is most tightly linked in the early postpartum weeks, but mothers continue to experience disturbed sleep and infant sleep and feeding behaviors continue to be associated with mothers’ depressive symptoms and stress ratings as long as 16 weeks postpartum. These data imply that interventions designed to improve maternal sleep and postpartum mood should include both mothers and infants because improving infant sleep alone is not likely to improve maternal sleep, and poor infant sleep is linked to postpartum depression and stress.

AB  - Background: Maternal depression has been associated with excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems, but the specificity of maternal depression, as compared with maternal anxiety remains unclear and manifest disorders prior to pregnancy have been widely neglected. In this prospective longitudinal study, the specific associations of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to, during and after pregnancy and infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems were investigated in the context of maternal parity. Methods: In the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n = 306 primiparous and multiparous women were repeatedly interviewed from early pregnancy until 16 months post partum with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI‐V) to assess DSM‐IV anxiety and depressive disorders. Information on excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems was obtained from n = 286 mothers during postpartum period via questionnaire and interview (Baby‐DIPS). Results: Findings from this study revealed syndrome‐specific risk constellations for maternal anxiety and depressive disorders as early as prior to pregnancy: Excessive infant crying (10.1%) was specifically associated with maternal anxiety disorders, especially in infants of younger and lower educated first‐time mothers. Feeding problems (36.4%) were predicted by maternal anxiety (and comorbid depressive) disorders in primiparous mothers and infants with lower birth weight. Infant sleeping problems (12.2%) were related to maternal depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders irrespective of maternal parity. Conclusions: Primiparous mothers with anxiety disorders may be more prone to anxious misinterpretations of crying and feeding situations leading to an escalation of mother–infant interactions. The relation between maternal depressive and infant sleeping problems may be better explained by a transmission of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy or a lack of daily structure and bedtime routine with the infant. Maternal disorders prior to pregnancy require more attention in research and clinical practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Α case of a chronic idiopathic form of a severe type of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which developed during pregnancy and persisted after this, misdiagnosed for 34 years as radiculopathy S1, is reported. In spite of the thorough clinical and laboratory investigation, in addition to constant changes of the therapeutic approach, the diagnosis of S1 radiculopathy could not be confirmed, resulting in a chronic clinical course; the latter was characterized by relapses and remissions not attributed or linked in any way to the treatment (various types of). In fact, it was due to a routine workup in a sleep clinic, where the patient was referred because of a coincident chronic insomnia (Restless Legs Syndrome is a known and important cause of insomnia/chronic insomnia), which resulted in a proper diagnosis and treatment of this case. With the use of Restless Legs Syndrome appropriate treatment (Pramipexole 0.18 mg taken at bedtime, a dopaminergic agent and Level A recommended drug for Restless Legs Syndrome) an excellent response and immediate elimination of symptoms was achieved. Restless Legs Syndrome may present with a variety of symptoms (with the most prominent shortly being reported with the acronym URGE: Urge to move the legs usually associated with unpleasant leg sensations, Rest induces symptoms, Getting active brings relief, Evening and night deteriorate symptoms); given the fact that Restless Legs Syndrome presents with a great variety and heterogeneity of symptoms (mostly pain, dysesthesia and paresthesia), which may occur in several other diseases (the so called "RLS mimics"), proper diagnosis of Restless Legs Syndrome usually fails. Restless Legs Syndrome misinterpreted as S1 radiculopathy, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported yet in the literature. Here, case history, clinical course and common RLS mimics are presented. Different forms of Restless Legs Syndrome manifestations, which are commonly -as in this case- misinterpreted due to their mimicking several pathological conditions, Restless Legs Syndrome prevalence on general population according to various large epidemiological studies and pathogenic hypotheses on the issue of Restless Legs Syndrome are discussed. Finally, by presenting another possible "RLS-mimic" our aim is to highlight the common misdiagnosis of Restless Legs Syndrome, which can mimic a variety of disorders, some of which are very common, such as an S1 radiculopathy, thus raising concern among doctors of various specialties addressed to by Restless Legs Syndrome sufferers, on the importance of proper diagnosis of the syndrome.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the associations of Intimate partner violence (IPV) with stress-related sleep disturbance (measured using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test [FIRST]) and poor sleep quality (measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) during early pregnancy. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. In-person interviews were conducted in early pregnancy to collect information regarding IPV history, and sleep traits. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated using logistic regression procedures. Results: Lifetime IPV was associated with a 1.54-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (95% CI: 1.08–2.17) and a 1.93-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.33–2.81). Compared with women experiencing no IPV during lifetime, the aOR (95% CI) for stress-related sleep disturbance associated with each type of IPV were: physical abuse only 1.24 (95% CI: 0.84–1.83), sexual abuse only 3.44 (95%CI: 1.07–11.05), and physical and sexual abuse 2.51 (95% CI: 1.27–4.96). The corresponding aORs (95% CI) for poor sleep quality were: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.13–2.61), 2.82 (95% CI: 0.99–8.03), and 2.50 (95% CI: 1.30–4.81), respectively. Women reporting any IPV in the year prior to pregnancy had increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.17–3.67) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.30–3.97) during pregnancy. Conclusion: Lifetime and prevalent IPV exposures are associated with stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be important mechanisms that underlie the lasting adverse effects of IPV on maternal and perinatal health.

AB  - Recently, we have shown that the contents of total nucleated cells (TNCs) and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (CD34+ HSPCs) as well as the cord blood volume (CBV) in umbilical cord blood (UCB) show a circadecadal (~10 years) rhythm of oscillation. This observation was based on an analysis of 17,936 cord blood donations collected during 1999–2011. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this circadecadal rhythm of oscillation in TNCs, CD34+ HSPCs and CBV is related to geomagnetic activity. For the analysis, the yearly averages of TNCs, CD34+ HSPCs and CBV in UCB were correlated with geomagnetic activity (Dcx index). Our analysis revealed that (i) all three UCB parameters were statistically significantly correlated with the level of geomagnetic activity, (ii) CBV showed a linear correlation with the Dcx index (r = 0.5290), (iii) the number of TNCs and CD34+ HSPCs were quadratic inversely correlated with the Dcx index (r = −0.5343 and r = −0.7749, respectively). Furthermore, (iv) CBV and the number of TNCs were not statistically significantly correlated with the number of either modest or intense geomagnetic storms per year, but (v) the number of CD34+ HSPCs was statistically significantly correlated with the number of modest (r = 0.9253) as well as intense (r = 0.8683) geomagnetic storms per year. In conclusion, our study suggests that UCB parameters correlate with the state of the geomagnetic field (GMF) modulated by solar activity. Possible biophysical mechanisms underlying this observation, as well as the outcome of these findings, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Animal studies demonstrate that circadian rhythm disruption during pregnancy can be deleterious to reproductive capacity and the long-term health of the progeny. Our previous studies in rats have shown that exposure of pregnant dams to an environment that significantly disrupts maternal circadian rhythms programs increased adiposity and poor glucose metabolism in offspring. In this study, we used mice with a ClockΔ19 mutation to determine whether foetal development within a genetically disrupted circadian environment affects pregnancy outcomes and alters the metabolic health of offspring. Ten female ClockΔ19+MEL mutant mice were mated with 10 wildtype males, and 10 wildtype females were mated with 10 ClockΔ19+MEL mutant males. While genetically identical, the heterozygote foetuses were exposed to either a normal (wildtype dams) or disrupted (ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams) circadian environment during gestation. Pregnancy outcomes including time to mate, gestation length, litter size and birth weight were assessed. One male and one female offspring from each litter were assessed for postnatal growth, body composition, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test at 3 and 12 months of age. There was no effect of maternal genotype on pregnancy outcomes, with days to plug, gestation length, litter size and perinatal mortality not significantly different between wildtype and ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams. Similarly, there was no effect of maternal genotype on weight of the offspring at birth or at any stage of postnatal growth. While there was an effect of sex on various tissue weights at 3 and 12 months of age, there were minimal effects of maternal genotype. Relative adrenal weight was significantly reduced (−32%) in offspring from ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams, whereas gastrocnemius muscle was significantly increased (+16%) at 3 months of age only. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests at 3 months of age revealed female offspring from ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams had significantly reduced area under the curve following glucose administration (−25%), although no differences were found at 12 months of age. There was no effect of maternal genotype on intraperitoneal insulin tolerance at 3 or 12 months of age for either sex. These results demonstrate that foetal growth within a genetically disrupted circadian environment during gestation has no effect on pregnancy success, and only marginal impacts upon the long-term metabolic health of offspring. These results do not support the hypothesis that circadian rhythm disruption during pregnancy programs poor metabolic homeostasis in offspring. However, when maintained on a 12L:12D photoperiod, the ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams display relatively normal patterns of activity and melatonin secretion, which may have reduced the impact of the mutation upon foetal metabolic programming.

AB  - Importance: African American women living in urban, low-income environments are at high risk for poor nutrition during pregnancy and birth complications. Objective: To test the effectiveness of prenatal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on birth outcomes and infant development in a sample of African American women with Medicaid insurance and living in the city of Pittsburgh. Design: The Nutrition and Pregnancy Study (NAPS) is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal DHA supplementation conducted between 2012 and 2014. Setting: Participants were recruited from obstetric clinics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Participants: Sixty-four pregnant, African American women were enrolled at 16–21 weeks of gestation and randomized to either 450mg/day of DHA (22:6n-3)(n = 43) or a soybean placebo (n = 21). Four women (6.3%) withdrew from the study: two participants from each study arm; complete data were obtained for 49 infants (76.5%) at the 3-month assessment. Interventions: Supplementation with DHA or placebo continued from the beginning of enrollment through delivery. Main outcome and measures: Data on birth outcomes were collected from medical records. At approximately 3 months post-partum, mothers brought their infants to the laboratory where the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) were administered and cortisol response to the Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) paradigm was assessed. Results: Infants of mothers who received DHA supplementation had higher birth weight (3.174g versus 2.890 g) than infants of mothers receiving placebo (F [2.40] = 6.09, p = 0.018, eta = 0.36), and were more likely to have a 1-min Apgar score greater than 8 (OR = 5.99 [95% CI = 1.25–28.75], p = 0.025). Infants of mothers who received DHA compared with infants of mothers receiving placebo had lower levels of cortisol in response to the FFSF paradigm (F [1.32] = 5.36, p = 0.018, eta = 0.36). None of the scores on the BSID-III differed as a function of active supplement versus placebo. Conclusions: Infants of women living in urban, low-income environments who received DHA supplementation had more optimal birth outcomes and more modulated cortisol response to a stressor. DHA supplementation may be effective in attenuating the negative effects of prenatal stress on offspring development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Disruption of the maternal environment during pregnancy leads to behavioral changes and diseases in the adult offspring. To explore the influence of prenatal continuous light exposure (PCLE) on the adult offspring, we exposed pregnant Wistar rats to constant light during late gestation. Adult PCLE offspring showed an anxiety-like behavior and impairment of short-term memory in different tests. Measurements in the whole brain homogenates from newborn and adult offspring indicated decreased melatonin and serotonin levels and increased reactive oxygen species level in PCLE offspring. Further, we determined melatonin-, serotonin-, oxidative stress-, apoptosis-, and circadian system-related genes expression in different brain areas of adult offspring. The serotonin reuptaker Slc6a4 displayed a decreased expression in the prefrontal cortex of PCLE group. The circadian rhythm-related gene Rora was upregulated in the amygdala of PCLE offspring. Our results point to adverse behavioral effects of PCLE on adult offspring, involving serotonin and melatonin signaling dysregulation, increased chronic oxidative stress, and altered gene expression.

AB  - The present study aimed to analyze the effects of sleep restriction (SR) during pregnancy in rats. The following three groups were studied: home cage (HC pregnant females remained in their home cage), Sham (females were placed in tanks similar to the SR group but with sawdust) and SR (females were submitted to the multiple platform method for 20h per day from gestational days (GD) 14 to 20). Plasma corticosterone after 6days of SR was not different among the groups. However, the relative adrenal weight was higher in the SR group compared with the HC group, which suggests possible stress impact. SR during pregnancy reduces the body weight of the female but no changes in liver glycogen, cholesterol and triglycerides, and muscle glycogen were detected. On GD 20, the fetuses of the females submitted to SR exhibited increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, which indicates that sleep restriction of mothers during the final week of gestation may affect neuronal growth factors in a fetal brain structure, in which active neurogenesis occurs during the deprivation period. However, no changes in the total reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cortex, hippocampus, or cerebellum of the fetuses were detected. SR females showed no major change in the maternal behavior, and the pups' preference for the mother's odor on postpartum day (PPD) 7 was not altered. On GD 20, the SR females exhibited increased plasma prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin (OT) compared with the HC and Sham groups. The negative outcomes of sleep restriction during delivery could be related, in part, to this hormonal imbalance. Sleep restriction during pregnancy induces different changes compared with the changes described in males and affects both the mother and offspring.

AB  - Presents the case report of 13-year-old girl presented with a history of myalgia (mainly in her lower extremities) since last 2–3 days to our hospital. She was born of an uneventful full-term pregnancy. Developmental milestones were normal. On medical history, she had partial onset of secondarily generalized seizures during sleep since 2 months. The EEG revealed left centrotemporal spikes and was subsequently diagnosed with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. The patient was administered LEV monotherapy. Rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed with clinical and biochemical findings. We thought LEV may be the cause of her complaints and ceased LEV therapy. Hydration therapy were started to avoid potential complications. After stopping LEV, serum CPK and myoglobin levels gradually decreased and returned into normal values. Muscle biopsy was not performed. In conclusion, we conclude that LEV may cause rhabdomyolysis. Children treated with LEV should be warned regarding these potential adverse effects, to facilitate early withdrawal of drug. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Only 9 % of women with young children consume a high quality diet. The association between sleep duration and health may be U-shaped. We examined diet quality in relation to sleep duration among US women within 5 years of childbirth. Methods: Data were from non-pregnant women aged 20–44 years within 5 years of childbirth who completed two 24-h dietary recalls (N = 896) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2012. Self-reported weekday/workday sleep duration was categorized as short (≤6 h), adequate (7–8 h), or long (≥9 h). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010, range 0–100) estimated overall and components of diet quality. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated the association between sleep duration and diet quality, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education. Results: Thirty-four percent of women reported short, 57.1 % adequate, and 8.6 % long sleep duration. The average diet quality total score was 47.4 out of 100. Short sleep duration was not associated with diet quality. Long sleep duration was associated with lower quality diet (β = −4.3; 95 % CI −8.1 to −0.4), lower consumption of total fruit (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.1), whole fruit (β = −0.9; 95 % CI −1.6 to −0.2), and total protein (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.03), and higher consumption of empty calories (β = 2.2; 95 % CI −4.3 to −0.1). Conclusions for practice: Future studies should examine the longitudinal association between sleep duration and diet quality among women following childbirth and whether interventions to improve sleep can enhance diet quality.

AB  - Prenatal sleep disturbance has been associated with undesirable birthing outcomes. To determine the effectiveness of listening to music at home in improving sleep quality, 121 Taiwanese pregnant women with poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] score > 5) were systematically assigned, with a random start to music listening (n = 61) or control (n = 60) group. Participants in the music listening group self-regulated listening to music in addition to receiving general prenatal care similar to that in the control group for 2 weeks. The PSQI and State-Anxiety Inventory were used to assess outcomes. ANCOVA analyses were used with the pretest scores as covariates and showed significant improvement in sleep quality, stress, and anxiety in the music listening group compared with the control group. The most frequently used music genre by participants in the experimental group was lullabies, followed by classical music and crystal baby music. This study supported the theory that 2-week music listening interventions may reduce stress, anxiety, and yield better sleep quality for sleep-disturbed pregnant women. The analysis of participants’ journals also implied that the expectant mothers’ choices of musical genres may correlate more with perceived prenatal benefits or the desire to interact with their unborn child.

AB  - Objectives: The role of stress in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has so far been neglected. We investigated the impact of stress exposure (pregnancy‐related and pregnancy‐unrelated major life events), psychological stress responses (perceived stress, subjective experience of stress, anxiety, depression, sleep), and physiological stress responses (salivary cortisol, plasma copeptin levels) on glucose concentrations during pregnancy. Design: Cross‐sectional study, including 203 pregnant women at the maternity department of a Swiss university hospital. Methods: All women underwent routine screening for GDM with a 75‐g oral glucose‐tolerance test at 24–30 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy‐related and pregnancy‐unrelated major life events, perceived stress, general psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and amount of sleep were assessed by validated self‐report questionnaires. Cortisol was measured using fasting and bedtime saliva samples, and copeptin using fasting plasma. All data were collected before communication of the screening test results. Results: Significant positive associations were found between the number of pregnancy‐related major life events and fasting glucose, while there was no association with pregnancy‐unrelated major life events. More anxiety and depressive symptoms, a higher general level of distress, and a shorter duration of sleep were related to fasting glucose, although the latter two were no longer significant when age and BMI were controlled for. However, physiological stress responses were not associated with glucose concentrations. When testing for unique associations with fasting glucose, more general distress and shorter duration of sleep independently accounted for higher fasting glucose levels. Finally, when comparing women with and without GDM, we found that women who subsequently received the diagnosis of GDM reported more pregnancy‐related life events. Conclusions: Some indicators of stress exposure and psychological stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant women, thus representing important risk factors for GDM development.

In the original article, the p values and legend in figure 1 were incorrectly mentioned. The correct figure 1 is given in the erratum.] Process C (internal clock) and Process S (sleep–wake homeostasis) are the basis of sleep–wake regulation. In the last trimester of pregnancy, foetal heart rate is synchronized with the maternal circadian rhythm. At birth, this interaction fails and an ultradian rhythm appears. Light exposure is a strong factor influencing the synchronization of sleep–wake processes. However, little is known about the effects of phototherapy on the sleep rhythm of premature babies. It was hypothesized that sleep in preterm infants would not differ during phototherapy, but that a maturation effect would be seen. Sleep states were studied in 38 infants born P = 0.083). Analysis of videos in infants not under phototherapy revealed an increase in time spent awake with increasing gestational age. The current data suggest that the ultradian rhythm of preterm infants seems to be independent of phototherapy, supporting the notion that sleep rhythm in this population is mainly driven by their internal clock.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether adopted children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from the general ASD population in terms of diagnosis, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, and medications. Methods: We studied 163 adoptees in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in comparison with 5624 nonadopted ATN participants (aged 1.5–17.6 years; mean [SD] = 6.2 [3.4] years). Gender, age, race, ethnicity, IQ, and categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, ASD diagnosis were tested for differences by group (adopted versus nonadopted) by using independent-samples t tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic or linear regression models were used to examine the association between adoption status and several outcome variables, after controlling for covariates. Results: After controlling for demographics and diagnosis, there were significant differences in group characteristics, including greater propensity for externalizing behavior (P P = .001), and sleep problems (P P P < .001), despite no significant difference in symptoms on standardized measures. Conclusions: These results suggest that the population of adopted children with ASD differs from the general ASD population both with regard to diagnostic subtype and co-occurring behavioral problems. Future research should evaluate the contributions of specific factors associated with adoption such as biological family history, pregnancy history, early childhood experience, and age at adoption.

AB  - Study Objectives: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is more prevalent in ex-preterm children compared to the general pediatric population. However, it is unknown whether OSAS in ex-preterm children is associated with specific perinatal risk factors. This multicenter cohort study aimed to determine perinatal factors associated with OSAS at school age. Methods: 197 ex-preterm (500–1,250 g) children aged 5–12 y who participated as neonates in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of caffeine versus placebo (Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity) underwent comprehensive ambulatory polysomnography. A negative binomial regression model was used to identify perinatal risk factors associated with OSAS. Results: 19 children had OSAS (9.6%). Chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation were positively associated with OSAS with P values of 0.014 and 0.03, respectively. Maternal white race (P = 0.047) and maternal age (P = 0.002) were negatively associated with OSAS. Other risk factors, such as birth weight, Apgar score at 5 min, antenatal corticosteroids, delivery route, and sex were not significant. Conclusions: OSAS is very frequent, and is associated with chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation in ex-preterm children. Those born to older white mothers appear to be protected. We speculate that the former may be due to systemic inflammation and the latter to a higher socio-economic status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Depression has been linked to an imbalance in cortisol. Until recently, cortisol has been studied by measuring concentrations at single time points in blood or saliva samples. Cortisol concentrations vary with circadian rhythm and experiences, from time point to time point. The measurement of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a new method of accessing mean, long-term cortisol concentrations. Recent studies show positive associations between depression and HCC, and prenatal maternal cortisol is thought to influence the developing fetus. We therefore examined the association between HCC and self-reported symptoms of depression in second trimester pregnant women. Participants were 181 women, recruited between September 2011 and October 2013 to the Little-in-Norway (LiN)-study. These women answered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Rating Scale (EPDS) on self-reported symptoms of depression, and one cm maternal scalp hair was collected and analyzed for cortisol concentrations. Multiple regression analyses did not show depressive symptoms as a predictor for HCC in our selection of pregnant women, while gestational age was significantly related. In conclusion, our study indicated that symptoms of depression during pregnancy did not predict HCC, but further studies of clinically depressed, pregnant women using gestational age as an adjustment variable are warranted.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep disorder that may be associated with pregnancy. Studies have found that the prevalence of RLS among pregnant women ranged from 10 to 34%. Typically, there is complete remission of symptoms soon after parturition; however, in some patients, they may continue postpartum. RLS has been shown to be associated with a number of complications in pregnancy including preeclampsia and increased incidence of Cesarean sections. Although multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association, each individual hypothesis cannot completely explain the whole pathogenesis. Present understanding suggests that a strong family history, low serum iron and ferritin level, and high estrogen level during pregnancy might play important roles. Vitamin D deficiency and calcium metabolism may also play a role. Medical treatment of RLS during pregnancy is difficult and challenging considering the risks to mother and fetus. However, in some cases, the disease may be severe enough to require treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Women's Health
AB  - Background: Recent research in major depressive disorder suggests that dysregulation of the circadian system may be a core pathophysiological component. In pregnancy, women often experience significant disruptions in their daily rhythms, including changes in day-to-day schedule and sleep habits. Current evidence suggests that these disruptions in daily rhythms may adversely affect underlying circadian rhythmicity. The purpose of our study was to examine whether subjectively rated daily rhythm disruptions were associated with a greater incidence of depressive symptoms during the third trimester. Method: Our study was a cross-sectional design, assessing sleep quality, symptoms of depression, and daily rhythm disruptions in 51 pregnant women in their third trimester. Results: We observed a significant relationship between mild depressive symptoms and disruptions in daily rhythms. While we initially observed a strong correlation between subjective sleep quality and depressive symptoms, this was attenuated after accounting for daily rhythm disruptions. Disruptions in daily social rhythms, eating patterns, and general activity were all significantly associated with depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Our findings point to a strong correlation between daily rhythm disruptions and prenatal depressive symptoms. Given that these daily rhythms are known to act as zeitgebers, longitudinal studies examining the directionality of this relationship between circadian rhythms and depressive symptoms during pregnancy are warranted.

AB  - Objectives: To examine: (1) the prevalence and characteristics of bed-sharing among non-Hispanic Black and White infants in Georgia, and (2) differences in bed-sharing and sleep position behaviors prior to and after the American Academy of Pediatrics’ 2005 recommendations against bed-sharing. Methods: Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Analysis was guided by the socioecological model levels of: Infant, Maternal, Family, and Community/Society within the context of race. Data from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed to address the first objective and from 2000 to 2004 and 2006 to 2011 to address the second objective. Rao–Scott Chi square tests and backward selection unconditional logistic regression models for weighted data were built separately by race; odds ratios (OR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: A total of 6595 (3528 Black and 3067 White) cases were analyzed between 2004 and 2011. Significantly more Black mothers (81.9 %) reported “ever” bed-sharing compared to White mothers (56 %), p < 0.001. Logistic regression results indicated that the most parsimonious model included variables from all socioecological levels. For Blacks, the final model included infant age, pregnancy intention, number of dependents, and use of Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Services. For Whites, the final model included infant age, maternal age, financial stress, partner-related stress, and WIC. When comparing the period 2000–2004 to 2006–2011, a total of 10,015 (5373 Black and 4642 White cases) were analyzed. A significant decrease in bedsharing was found for both Blacks and Whites; rates of non-supine sleep position decreased significantly for Blacks but not Whites. Conclusions for Practice: Continued high rates of bed-sharing and non-supine sleep position for both Blacks and Whites demonstrate an ongoing need for safe infant sleep messaging. Risk profiles for Black and White mothers differed, suggesting the importance of tailored messaging. Specific research and practice implications are identified and described.

AB  - Presents a case report of a 1-month-old girl who presented with poor weight gain and feeding interrupted by apparent distress and easy fatigability. The pregnancy was significant for an exacerbation of pre-existing maternal depression and anxiety at 15 weeks of gestation, requiring the use of venlafaxine, olanzapine, quetiapine and temazepam. Venlafaxine was continued as monotherapy from 20 weeks gestation for the remainder of the pregnancy and in early breastfeeding. On day three of life, the infant had extensor posturing and cycling of the limbs which was thought to be seizure related. The maternal dose of 300 mg venlafaxine was supra-therapeutic, with the recommended adult dose starting at 75 mg daily. Venlafaxine and its major metabolite (O-desmethylvenlafaxine) are concentrated in breast milk (milk:plasma ratio of 3–4:1), a high infant dose when compared with other antidepressants. Exposure to antidepressant medications in utero may precipitate the onset of symptoms including tremors, jitteriness, irritability, muscle tone regulation disorders, excessive crying, sleep disturbance, tachypnoea and feeding problems. Interestingly, venlafaxine expression in breast milk may be protective for PNA in infants exposed in utero, mitigating withdrawal symptoms. This case illustrates the need to monitor breastfed infants of mothers taking venlafaxine for excessive sedation and adequate weight gain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) complicates 5–10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, mortality and neurodevelopmental delay. The development of sleep and cardiovascular control are closely coupled and IUGR is known to alter this development. In the long-term, IUGR is associated with altered sleep and an increased risk of hypertension in adulthood. Melatonin plays an important role in the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental animal studies have shown that melatonin therapy has neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in the IUGR fetus. Consequently, clinical trials are currently underway to assess the short and long term effects of antenatal melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies. Given melatonin's role in sleep regulation, this hormone could affect the developing infants' sleep-wake cycle and cardiovascular function after birth. In this review, we will 1) examine the role of melatonin as a therapy for IUGR pregnancies and the potential implications on sleep and the cardiovascular system; 2) examine the development of sleep-wake cycle in fetal and neonatal life; 3) discuss the development of cardiovascular control during sleep; 4) discuss the effect of IUGR on sleep and the cardiovascular system and 5) discuss the future implications of melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - The aims of this paper are to study the associations between objective and subjective sleep in pregnant women, to examine which specific aspects of women’s sleep are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and to test the moderating role of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the relations between objective and subjective sleep. The sample included 148 pregnant women. Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy for five nights at the participants’ home, and subjective sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale and anxiety symptoms with the Beck anxiety inventory. Significant associations were found between the subjective sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores, but there were no significant associations between actigraphic sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores. Depressive and anxiety scores emerged as significant moderators of the links between objective and subjective sleep. The findings suggest that emotional distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms severity) during pregnancy is associated with subjective sleep disturbances but not with objective sleep disturbances. Importantly, only among women with higher levels of emotional distress was subjective sleep quality associated with objective sleep quality. These findings may suggest that women with higher levels of emotional distress are not necessarily biased in their perception of sleep quality. However, they may perceive fragmented sleep as more detrimental to their wellbeing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abnormalities of sleep and biological rhythms have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, less is known about the influence of biological rhythm disruptions across the perinatal period on postpartum depression (PPD). The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the relationship between subjective changes in both sleep and biological rhythms and worsening of depressive symptoms from pregnancy to the postpartum period in women with and without mood disorders. Eighty-three participants (38 euthymic women with a history of a mood disorder and 45 healthy controls) were studied. Participants completed subjective assessments of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), biological rhythm disturbances (Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), and depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) prospectively at two time points: third trimester of pregnancy and at 6–12 weeks postpartum. Multivariate regression analyses showed that changes in biological rhythms across the perinatal period predicted worsening of depressive symptoms in both groups. Moreover, women with a history of a mood disorder showed higher levels of sleep and biological rhythm disruption during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. These findings suggest that disruptions in biological rhythms during the perinatal period increase the risk for postpartum mood worsening in healthy pregnant as well as in pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

AB  - Rationale: Anxiety during pregnancy has been linked to adverse maternal health outcomes, including postpartum depression (PPD). However, there has been limited study of biological mechanisms underlying behavioral predictors of PPD during pregnancy. Objectives: Considering the shared etiology of chronic stress amongst antenatal behavioral predictors, the primary goal of this pilot study was to examine associations among stress-related physiological factors (including GABA-ergic neurosteroids) and stress-related behavioral indices of anxiety during pregnancy. Methods: Fourteen nulliparous women in their second trimester of a singleton pregnancy underwent speech and mental arithmetic stress, following a 2-week subjective and objective recording of sleep-wake behavior. Results: Lower cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of ALLO + pregnanolone throughout the entire stressor protocol (area under the curve, AUC) were associated with greater negative emotional responses to stress, and lower cortisol AUC was associated with worse sleep quality. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone was associated with greater anxious and depressive symptoms. Stress produced paradoxical reductions in cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of allopregnanolone + pregnanolone, while tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were elevated. Conclusions: These data suggest that cortisol, progesterone, and ALLO + pregnanolone levels in the second trimester of pregnancy are inversely related to negative emotional symptoms, and the negative impact of acute stress challenge appears to exert its effects by reducing these steroids to further promote negative emotional responses.

AB  - Objective: To examine the relationship between prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, and to determine whether resilience plays a mediating role in the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality among pregnant women. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-one pregnant women in their second trimester participated in the study. They completed questionnaires, including: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). A structural equation model was used to analyze the relationships among prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, with resilience as a mediator. Results: Prenatal maternal stress was negatively associated with sleep quality in pregnant women (p p p < 0.01). Conclusions: The risk factor for disturbed sleep was pregnancy-specific stress; however, the protective factor for sleep quality was resilience. This finding could provide scientific evidence for the development of intervention strategies with which to improve sleep quality in pregnant women.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a health coaching (HC) intervention designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), and promote positive psychosocial and motivational outcomes in comparison with an Education Alone (EA) group. Design: Randomized‐controlled trial. Methods: Two hundred and sixty‐one women who were b = 0.29, 95% CIs = 0.03–0.55, p b = 0.27, 95% CIs = 0.02–0.52, p b = −0.22, 95% CIs = −0.44 to −0.03, p b = −1.75, 95% CI = −3.26 to −0.24, p < .05) reported by the HC at Time 2. Conclusions: Whilst the HC intervention was not successful in preventing excessive GWG, several implications for the design of future GWG interventions were identified, including the burden of the intervention commitment and the use of weight monitoring. Statement of contribution: What is already known on the subject? Designing interventions to address gestational weight gain (GWG) continues to be a challenge. To date, health behaviour change factors have not been the focus of GWG interventions. What does this study add? Our health coaching (HC) intervention did not reduce GWG more so than education alone (EA). There was an intervention effect on readiness and importance to achieve healthy GWG. Yet there were no group differences regarding confidence to achieve healthy GWG post‐intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sleep complaints are common amongst mothers of infants and insufficient, inefficient or fragmented sleep is associated with postnatal depression. The aim of this review is to determine whether psychosocial sleep-focused interventions offered in the perinatal period improve infant sleep or maternal mood. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE and CINAHL with no date restriction. We reviewed 1097 articles, resulting in nine papers (n = 1,656) that fit the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the analyses. The primary outcome was infant sleep, defined as maternal reports of infant nocturnal total sleep time and number of night-time wakes. The secondary outcome was maternal mood. The meta-analysis indicated improvements in reported infant nocturnal total sleep time (Hedge's g = 0.204, p < 0.01). However, there was no evidence for reducing infant night wakes (Hedge's g = 0.103, p = 0.134). There was evidence of maternal mood improvements (Hedge's g = 0.152, p = 0.014), however, this could have been influenced by publication bias. Psychosocial sleep interventions appear to impact the amount of sleep that a mother reports her baby to have, although the infants continue to wake as frequently. More research is needed to confirm whether sleep-related improvements can translate into improvements in maternal mood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Women with a diagnosis of bipolar and major depressive disorders are at higher risk to develop postpartum depression. The primary objective of this longitudinal study was to determine whether daily activity rhythms and sleep parameters differ between women with and without a history of a mood disorder across the perinatal period. A secondary objective was to determine whether changes in these parameters were associated with postpartum mood. In total, 33 women were included in this study, 15 of which had a history of a mood disorder (high-risk group) and 18 who did not (low-risk group). Sleep and daily rhythms were assessed subjectively and objectively during the third trimester (≥26 weeks gestation) and again at 6–12 weeks postpartum. Mood was also assessed at both time points. Women in the high-risk group showed greater subjective daily rhythms and sleep disturbances across the perinatal period. Objective sleep efficiency was worse in the high-risk group in the postpartum period. Changes in both subjective daily rhythms and objective sleep efficiency were predictive of changes in depressive symptoms across the perinatal period. These findings encourage the development of preventative therapeutics to ensure circadian rhythm and sleep stability throughout the perinatal period.

AB  - Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period. A risk factor for mood disorders is poor sleep quality. In this study we investigate the effects of poor subjective prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of prenatal depression or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population. Methods: We analysed data from a subset of women taking part in a prospective cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes. The participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory between 26 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (Time 1) and at 3 months postpartum (Time 2), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at Time 1. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, while adjusting for prenatal depressive/anxiety symptoms and education. Results: Although borderline-high depressive/anxiety symptoms were the strongest predictors of postnatal depressive/anxiety, independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality during pregnancy was also associated with borderline-high postnatal depressive symptoms, but not with postnatal anxiety. Limitations: Sleep quality and prenatal/postnatal mood were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more susceptible to bias. Conclusion: Although treatment of symptoms of prenatal depression and anxiety will be the most important for reducing postnatal depression and anxiety, in addition to that, future studies may explore treatments improving prenatal sleep quality, particularly for women with antenatal depressive symptoms.

AB  - Many studies have shown that shorter sleep duration in childhood is associated with higher body mass index (BMI), and have proposed that it is due to an effect of sleep on adiposity. There is little evidence about the association of sleep with fat‐free mass. This study examined the association between child's sleep duration at age 3 years and fat and fat‐free mass at 4 years of age in a prospective cohort study of 302 boys and 285 girls. Study participants were taking part in the Southampton Women's Survey, a longitudinal study of mothers and children from preconception onwards. Total sleep duration at age 3 years was derived from parental report of night sleep and nap duration. Body composition was assessed by Dual‐energy X‐ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at 4 years. Mean total sleep duration was 11.5 hours. In linear regression analyses, adjusted for potentially confounding factors (maternal educational attainment, prepregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, child's gestational age at birth, age at DXA, sex, age last breastfed, dietary quality at 3 years, TV watching and hours actively on the move and parental social class), shorter sleep in hours was associated with higher BMI (kg/m²) [β: −0.2340, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.373 to −0.096], a greater fat mass index (kg) (β: −0.1182, 95% CI: −0.218 to −0.018) and a greater fat‐free mass index (kg) (β: −0.100, 95% CI: −0.185 to −0.015). Previous research suggested that the association between shorter sleep and higher body mass index is due to an effect on adiposity. Our findings are novel, suggesting that the relationship between sleep and BMI is also determined by an effect on muscle. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This investigation was conducted to examine circadian and seasonal rhythms of heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) by means of hour-by-hour recordings over 24 h in a large population of non-lactating Holstein–Friesian pregnant cows [N = 56, summer (June–July); N = 61, winter (November–December)]. Data were collected during a 5-day period from each animal. Besides parameters of cardiac autonomic function [the high-frequency (HF) component of HRV and the ratio between the low-frequency (LF) and the HF components (LF/HF ratio)], the RR triangular index and Lmax were calculated. A clear circadian profile was observed for every parameter in summer. Heart rate elevated gradually with the course of the day from 7:00 to 17:00 o'clock and then slightly decreased from 18:00 to 6:00. Sympathovagal balance shifted towards sympathetic dominance during the daytime (increased LF/HF ratio), whereas parasympathetic activity was predominant during the night (increased HF). Lmax reflected a chaotic behavior of heart rate fluctuations during the afternoon in summer. Decreased values of RR triangular index indicated a sensitive period for cows between 14:00 and 16:00 o'clock in summer. During winter, except for the RR triangular (RRtri) index reflecting a high overall variability in R–R intervals between 12:00 and 23:00 o'clock, heart rate and HRV showed no periodicity over the 24-h period. The results suggest an impaired cardiac autonomic function during daytime in summer. HF, Lmax and RRtri index showed seasonal differences for both daytime and nighttime. Heart rate was higher in summer than in winter during the daytime, whereas the LF/HF ratio was higher in winter during the nighttime. Circadian and seasonal rhythms of cardiovascular function are presumably related to the differing temperature, and animal activity associated with summer and winter. As all of the investigated parameters are commonly used in bovine HRV research, these findings have practical implications for behavioral, physiological and welfare studies on dairy cattle.

AB  - Objective: Greater acculturation is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in Mexican-American women, but the mechanisms by which acculturation influences perinatal outcomes are unclear. Pregnant acculturated Mexican-American women are more likely to engage in unhealthy prenatal behaviors relative to those less acculturated, including poor sleep. As sleep disruptions are associated with acculturation and negative perinatal outcomes, particularly maternal depression, alterations in sleep may adversely affect pregnant Mexican-American women. Methods: Sixty pregnant women of Mexican descent completed surveys about sleep, acculturation, depressive symptoms and potential protective factor of social support. Results: Acculturation, but not social support, significantly predicted increased sleep disruptions as well as overall feeling less refreshed upon waking across pregnancy. Moderation analysis indicated that more acculturated women who took longer to fall asleep reported increased depressive symptoms. Feeling refreshed upon waking also mediated the relationship between increased acculturation and elevated maternal depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Acculturation and altered sleep contribute to greater risk in Mexican-American women for maternal depressive symptoms in the perinatal period. These findings have implications for prevention and treatment of maternal mental health disorders, which may adversely affect perinatal outcomes in the vulnerable Mexican-American population.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances are common in women, especially during pregnancy. Previous studies have confirmed the importance of sleep disturbances as a risk factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the need for screening and treatment of inadequate sleep. These reports, however, did not examine health-related quality of life which may be affected by sleep long before adverse clinical consequences are detectable in women during pregnancy. Objectives: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between sleep and health-related quality of life in pregnant women. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: A university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan and participants’ homes. Participants: A total of 164 pregnant women completed questionnaires and wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 days each trimester. Methods: Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy, subjective sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-12v2 questionnaire across three trimesters. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between sleep and health-related quality of life. Results: Sixty-four (39.0%) women consistently had an average sleep efficiency5 in all three trimesters. Cross-sectionally, more actigraphic daytime sleep (p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality (p p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality (p p p p p < 0.01) predicted mental health-related quality of life in the second and third trimester. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are a highly prevalent and persistent problem in pregnant women. Adequate sleep is essential for women at all pregnancy stages and improving nocturnal sleep quantity and quality in early gestation is of utmost importance for an optimal health-related quality of life later in pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Sleep disturbance, depression, and daytime sleepiness are among the most prevalent symptoms reported by women during pregnancy. However, available data on the association between sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women are sparse and methodological limitations have been acknowledged. The purpose of the study was to examine objective and self-reported sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in a group of healthy pregnant women. Methods: A total of 274 third-trimester pregnant women wore a wrist actigraph continuously for 7 days to assess objective sleep quality and quantity. Self-reported sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with self-reported poor sleep quality defined as a PSQI score more than 5. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to evaluate symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Results: Sixty-four (23.4%) women were at risk for clinical depression and 69 (25.2%) had daytime sleepiness. Risk of clinically meaningful depressive symptomatology was significantly increased in women with objective total nighttime sleep less than 6 hours (OR 2.53 [95% CI 1.26–5.08]) and selfreported poor sleep quality (OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.74–6.30]), even after multiple adjustment. Neither objective nor self-reported sleep disturbances increased daytime sleepiness in this group of pregnant women. Discussion: Both objective nighttime sleep less than 6 hours and self-reported poor sleep quality in healthy third-trimester pregnant women is associated with significant risks for clinical depression. Improving sleep would likely be associated with a reduction in depression symptom severity and an attenuation of the prevalence of depression in pregnant women.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of a fertility awareness-based method supported by a mobile-based application to prevent unwanted pregnancies as a method of natural birth control. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, the application’s efficiency as a contraceptive method was examined on data from 4054 women who used the application as contraception for a total of 2085 woman-years. Results: The number of identified unplanned pregnancies was 143 during 2053 woman-years, giving a Pearl Index of 7.0 for typical use. Ten of the pregnancies were due to the application falsely attributing a safe day within the fertile window, producing a perfect-use Pearl Index of 0.5. Calculating the cumulative pregnancy probability by life-table analysis resulted in a pregnancy rate of 7.5% per year (95% confidence interval 5.9%, 9.1% per year). Conclusions: The application appears to improve the effectiveness of fertility awareness-based methods and can be used to prevent pregnancies if couples consistently protect themselves on fertile days.

AB  - Background: Approximately 25 % of pregnant women suffer from a high level of Fear of Childbirth (FoC), as assessed by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A, score ≥66). FoC negatively affects pregnant women’s mental health and adaptation to the perinatal period. Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) seems to be potentially effective in decreasing pregnancy-related anxiety and stress. We propose a theoretical model of Avoidance and Participation in Pregnancy, Birth and the Postpartum Period in order to explore FoC and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of change of MBCP. Methods/Design: The ‘I’ve Changed My Mind’ study is a quasi-experimental controlled trial among 128 pregnant women (week 16–26) with a high level of FoC, and their partners. Women will be allocated to MBCP (intervention group) or to Fear of Childbirth Consultation (FoCC; comparison group). Primary outcomes are FoC, labour pain, and willingness to accept obstetrical interventions. Secondary outcomes are anxiety, depression, general stress, parental stress, quality of life, sleep quality, fatigue, satisfaction with childbirth, birth outcome, breastfeeding self-efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The total study duration for women is six months with four assessment waves: pre- and post-intervention, following the birth and closing the maternity leave period. Discussion: Given the high prevalence and severe negative impact of FoC this study can be of major importance if statistically and clinically meaningful benefits are found. Among the strengths of this study are the clinical-based experimental design, the extensive cognitive-emotional and behavioural measurements in pregnant women and their partners during the entire perinatal period, and the representativeness of study sample as well as generalizability of the study’s results. The complex and innovative measurements of FoC in this study are an important strength in clinical research on FoC not only in pregnant women but also in their partners.

AB  - Objective: The Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms (LIFE-Moms) Consortium is designed to determine, in pregnant women with overweight or obesity, whether various behavioral and lifestyle interventions reduce excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and subsequent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and obesity in offspring. The design and planning process of the LIFE-Moms Consortium is described. Methods: The LIFE-Moms Consortium is a collaboration among seven clinical centers, a Research Coordinating Unit, and the NIH designed to support each clinical center’s conduct of a separate trial of a unique intervention. Specific common measures, procedures, and eligibility criteria are consistent across the seven trials allowing data to be combined in exploratory analyses and/or compared readily. Results: Numerous committees and working groups were created to define common measures and outcomes during pregnancy and through 1 year postpartum, develop Consortium policies, and oversee progress of the trials. The primary outcome for the Consortium is excessive GWG. Secondary outcomes include maternal, neonatal, and infant anthropometric measures, physical activity, sleep, and complications of pregnancy and delivery. Conclusions: A multi-center consortium of independent, lifestyle interventions with common measures and outcomes may enhance the ability to identify promising interventions for improving outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate sleep quality and health-related quality of life in pregnancy. In a cross-sectional design, 492 women (292 pregnant and 200 nonpregnant healthy controls) were included in this study between November 2014 and June 2015. Participants completed a survey on sociodemographic characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). The PSQI total and EQ-5D scores of pregnant women were significantly worse than the controls (P = .017 and P P = .009). Compared with the first trimester, the risk of poor sleep quality increased 2.11-fold in the second trimester (P = .048) and 1.86-fold in the third trimester (P = .054). Compared with the first trimester, EQ-5D scores significantly decreased in the second (P = .038) and third (P < .001) trimesters. Sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women were worse than those of nonpregnant healthy controls. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of deteriorations in sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the associations of sleep hygiene and actigraphy measures of sleep with self‐reported sleep quality in 197 pregnant women in northern Taiwan. Third‐trimester pregnant women completed the Sleep Hygiene Practice Scale (SHPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) as well as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies‐Depression Scale (CES‐D), and wore an actigraph for 7 consecutive days. Student's t‐test was used to compare the SHPS scores and means as well as variability of actigraphy sleep variables between poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score >5) and good sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score ≤ 5). Compared to good sleepers, poor sleepers reported significantly worse sleep hygiene, with higher SHPS scores and higher sleep schedule, arousal‐related behavior, and sleep environment subscale scores. Poor sleepers had significantly greater intra‐individual variability of sleep onset latency, total nighttime sleep, and wake after sleep onset than good sleepers. In stepwise linear regression, older maternal age (p = .01), fewer employment hours per week (p = .01), higher CES‐D total score (p p < .01) predicted self‐reported global sleep quality. Findings support avoiding physically, physiologically, emotionally, or cognitively arousing activities before bedtime as a target for sleep‐hygiene intervention in women during pregnancy.

AB  - Night waking in preschoolers has been associated with adverse health outcomes in cross-sectional studies, but has rarely been analyzed in a longitudinal setting. Therefore, little is known about the evolution of night waking in early childhood. The objectives of the present study were: to identify night-waking trajectories in preschoolers, and to examine the risk factors associated with those trajectories. Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Data on a child's night waking at the ages of two, three, and five, six years, and potential confounders, were collected through parental self-reported questionnaires. Night-waking trajectories were computerized using group-based trajectory modeling on 1346 children. Two distinct developmental patterns were identified: the “2–5 rare night-waking” (77% of the children) and the “2–5 common night-waking” pattern. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated with the trajectories. Risk factors for belonging to the “2–5 common night-waking” trajectory were: exposure to passive smoking at home, daycare in a collective setting, watching television for extended periods, bottle feeding at night, high emotionality, and low shyness. This approach allowed identification of risk factors associated with night waking during a critical age window, and laid the groundwork for identifying children at higher risk of deleterious sleep patterns. Those risk factors were mainly living habits, which indicated that prevention and intervention programs could be highly beneficial in this population.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease is 3-fold more prevalent in pregnant than in non-pregnant women. Symptoms are particularly strong and frequent during the third trimester of pregnancy and disappear around delivery. A preexisting form of RLS tends to worsen during pregnancy. Women who experience RLS during pregnancy have a higher risk of symptoms in further pregnancies and of developing a primary form of RLS later in life, than women free of symptoms during pregnancy. This article reviews the literature for pregnancy-related RLS, with particular attention to its epidemiology, course, possible mechanisms, management, and the impact of symptoms.

T2  - Sleep Medicine Clinics
AB  - Various medications and behavioral treatments for sleep-related leg cramps have been tried, but the quality of the evidence is low. Quinine seems to be effective, but dangerous. β-Agonists may be one of the more common causes of secondary leg cramps. Statins may not be implicated in leg cramps as much as has been believed. Potassium-sparing diuretics may have a higher incidence of sleep-related leg cramps than potassium-depleting diuretics. Plantar flexion of the feet may elicit most sleep-related leg cramps. More research into behavioral treatments is needed. A standardized sleep-related leg cramp questionnaire would be useful to expand research.

T2  - Behavioral Sleep Medicine
AB  - Comments on an article Mood disorder history and personality assessment in premenstrual dysphoric disorder by S. K. Dørheim (2001). Pregnancy and the postpartum period are characterized by dramatic physical, mental, and hormonal changes. Sleep is disrupted particularly in the third trimester, when the majority of women report awakening at night, and sleep continues to be disrupted for the first few months postpartum in mothers, mainly due to meeting the needs of the newborn. The disruption to sleep is expected and considered a normal part of pregnancy and postpartum. However, for some women, clinically significant poor sleep quality can have negative consequences for maternal and fetal health. Disturbed sleep is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. An important question is: What factors determine whether a woman will experience more severe sleep disruption during her pregnancy or will be impacted to a greater extent by the typical sleep disruption?

AB  - Becoming pregnant and giving birth can lead to considerable psychological, behavioral, and cognitive transformation. The nature and scope of change vary a great deal from woman to woman. This chapter summarizes qualitative and quantitative research on normal psychological adaptation to pregnancy. Including recognition and acceptance of the pregnant state, experience of the boundary between self and fetus, and body image changes. It reviews research on internal representations of the fetus and fetal and neonatal attachment. Perinatal changes in stress reactivity and coping style are reviewed. The chapter explains the influence of women's prenatal expectations about labor and delivery on subsequent experiences and reactions and describes normative postpartum mood reactivity. Perinatal effects on sleep physical activity, sexual activity, and eating patterns are described. Controversies about the effects of pregnancy on cognition are examined. The chapter also covers topics related to the transition to motherhood, including influences on maternal self-esteem and self-efficacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Much research has focused on understanding why women are at increased risk of serious mental health symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum. Although psychosocial stressors play a major role in perinatal psychiatric disorders, not every woman who experiences adverse psychosocial circumstances develops a major psychiatric illness during this time. As such, attention has focused on exploring how biological factors might impact the development of perinatal psychopathology. This chapter reviews biological changes during pregnancy and the postpartum that may contribute to the onset and/or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in the perinatal period. It discusses heritability and genetics research suggesting that some women may have a biological predisposition to developing psychopathology in the perinatal period. Then, the chapter focuses on pregnancy- and childbirth-related biological changes in sex hormones; the neurotransmitter, endocrine, and immune systems; and sleep that may be contributing biological factors in perinatal psychopathology for women at risk.

AB  - Sleep quality in women has been linked to changes in hormone levels due to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum recovery, and menopause. Postpartum women are more likely to experience sleep disturbances than any non-postpartum women, with the most reporting exhaustion during the first 3 postpartum months. The most common reasons for sleep disturbances are related to newborn sleep and feeding patterns. A sudden drop in placental hormones following birth, as well as the unpredictable sleep patterns of the newborn, contributes to the postpartum woman's poor sleep and alteration of her circadian rhythm. Complaints about excessive sleepiness, fatigue and sleep loss should be evaluated by health care providers, considering the fact that they are potentially harmful to the newborn and relationship with postpartum depression. They should be treated with proper pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic approaches. Pharmacologic ones to sleep disturbances should be viewed with caution during lactation because of the risk to infant development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Brain, Behavior, and Immunity
AB  - Fever has been recognized as an important symptom of disease since ancient times. For many years, fever was treated as a putative life-threatening phenomenon. More recently, it has been recognized as an important part of the body’s defense mechanisms; indeed at times it has even been used as a therapeutic agent. The knowledge of the functional role of the central nervous system in the genesis of fever has greatly improved over the last decade. It is clear that the febrile process, which develops in the sick individual, is just one of many brain-controlled sickness symptoms. Not only will the sick individual appear "feverish" but they may also display a range of behavioral changes, such as anorexia, fatigue, loss of interest in usual daily activities, social withdrawal, listlessness or malaise, hyperalgesia, sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction, collectively termed “sickness behavior”. In this review we consider the issue of whether fever and sickness behaviors are friend or foe during: a critical illness, the common cold or influenza, in pregnancy and in the newborn. Deciding whether these sickness responses are beneficial or harmful will very much shape our approach to the use of antipyretics during illness.

AB  - Depression has been associated with sleep disturbances in pregnancy; however, no previous research has controlled the possible confounding effect of anxiety on this association. This study aims to analyze the effect of depression on sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy controlling for anxiety. The sample was composed by 143 depressed (n = 77) and non-depressed (n = 66) pregnant women who completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep. Differences between groups in sleep controlling for anxiety were found. Depressed pregnant women present higher number of nocturnal awakenings and spent more hours trying falling asleep during the night and the entire 24 h period. Present findings point out the effect of depression on sleep in late pregnancy, after controlling for anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To examine the independent and joint relationships of poor subjective sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation among pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders. Results: Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P5 vs. ≤5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.02–2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.08–1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a 3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR = 3.48; 95% CI 1.96–6.18) as compared with those who had neither risk factor. Conclusion: Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation. Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.

AB  - Presents a case report of hot water epilepsy in a 7-month old Caucasian infant. The infant was admitted to the hospital after two episodes of unresponsiveness while bathing. His mother noticed that after immersing of the lower part of the infant’s body in water, he suddenly became activity arrested, confused, experienced glazed–eyed staring and had facial cyanosis for approximately 1 min. At the end of the attack, the child fell asleep for approximately half an hour. After awakening, he was alert and looked well. The infant was the only child in the family, and the mother had an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. The child had attained normal developmental milestones. The family history was negative for epilepsy and febrile seizures. The child had normal neurological examination results, psychological status, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging analyses. An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus rhythm with a normal QT interval. During sleep, the EEG showed normal sleep organization with intermittent sleep spindles. There were no abnormal discharges identified. A seizure episode was triggered by imitating the home bathing conditions. The child was diagnosed with hot water epilepsy. The boy experienced no seizures during a period of one year, and his psychomotor development was normal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, sleep quality and unplanned Caesarean delivery. For this research, we adopted a prospective survey design and a sample of 200 women in the early stages of labour. The findings were as follows: (i) 11.5% of the participants underwent unplanned Caesarean sections; (ii) based on a Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index split point of 5, approximately 90.5% of the participants experienced poor sleep quality; and (iii) the odds ratio for primiparas undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section was 4.183 times that for multiparas (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.177 to 14.864), indicating a statistically significant difference. The results also showed that stress was a significant factor related to unplanned Caesarean sections; a 1-point increase on the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale was associated with a 1.033-fold higher probability of undergoing an unplanned Caesarean section (95% CI = 1.002 to 1.065). Furthermore, prenatal stress was a significant variable that can be used to predict unplanned Caesarean deliveries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Early childhood risk factors for executive dysfunction in a sample of school-aged children.
AU  - Grahovec, Morgan Carey
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to explore whether early childhood factors influence executive function scores, as determined by objective neuropsychological tests and subjective parent and teacher ratings, in a diverse sample of school age children. Data was collected longitudinally over four different visits that corresponded to childhood development (7.76 months, 20 months, 38 months, and 7 years of age). The independent variables examined in the present study included environmental, sociodemographic, and neuropsychological data from the first three time points. At Time 1, the independent variables were SES at Time 1, infant birth weight, maternal body mass index, parental stress at Time 1, and the psychomotor development score at Time 1. At Time 2 and Time 3, the independent variables were SES, parental stress, the sleep problems composite, the DSM-IV ADHD composite, and the psychomotor development index score. Results indicated that overall, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, the psychomotor development score, and SES were the only significant predictors from the first three time points of variance in the Time 4 executive functions as measured by the neuropsychological assessments. The findings showed an inverse relationship between maternal BMI and neuropsychological executive functions. A positive relationship between family SES and neuropsychological EF was found, as expected. A positive relationship was found between psychomotor functions at Time 3 and executive functions at Time 4, which was also in the expected direction. An inverse relationship between parent stress and executive functions was found at all three initial time points, revealing that parents who experience more subjective stress also have children with lower executive functions. The longitudinal design of this study allowed for the confirmation of the hypothesis that there are significant variables in early childhood that are associated with executive functions later in life. This knowledge has important implications because the more that is understood about executive functioning in children, the more it will be possible to provide meaningful interventions that can maximize a child's development of this critical skill set.

AB  - This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional design was used with young women (n = 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named “mixed)”, and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

TI  - Technical versus public spheres: A feminist analysis of women’s rhetoric in the Twilight Sleep debates of 1914–1916.
AU  - Johnson, Bethany

T2  - Health Communication
AB  - Twilight Sleep (TS) describes the delivery, via an injection, of an amnestic drug cocktail to a parturient woman throughout labor. In order to understand the development of modern-day rhetoric surrounding childbirth methods and procedures, this article explores the debate over TS between the public and technical sphere in New York City between 1914 and 1916 and examines the ways in which this debate altered obstetric health care for middle- and upper-class White women. The public response to this campaign posed a direct challenge to male obstetricians in New York City, many of whom were ill-equipped, both literally and figuratively, to use this procedure. Using a feminist rhetorical criticism, we examined the pro-TS rhetoric of women writers in New York City, the methods they borrowed from the women’s movement, and the ensuing dialogue between the public and technical spheres. For this study, we analyzed journal and newspaper articles, a pamphlet, a collection of pro-TS organizational documents, letters to the editor, and books published about TS and the history of birth. Lastly, we analyzed theoretical notions of childbirth in women’s health and communication studies. After examining the TS debate, we found that birth practices for middle- and upper-class women in New York City shifted and the obstetric community gained ascendancy over female midwifery. We also found that in certain instances, the rhetoric of pro-TS activists was more technically accurate than the rhetoric of some physicians. Hence the TS debate emerged from an argument over the right to use technical language in the technical and/or the public sphere. Conclusions and implications offered by this historical, feminist analysis question our current understanding of women’s health and birthing practices, doctor–patient communication, and patient empowerment and access to technical knowledge.

AB  - Aim: To identify and describe infant deaths presenting suddenly and unexpectedly in whom there was a history of maternal methadone consumption or misuse of drugs during pregnancy. Methods: Retrospective review of neonatal postmortem examinations between 2004 and 2011. Results: A total of 138 autopsies were performed in infants up to 28 days. Thirty-two cases (23%) presented suddenly and unexpectedly. In 12 of 32 (37.5%), in whom the cause of death remained unexplained after a thorough postmortem, there was a history of methadone use and/or other drugs of abuse during pregnancy. Their mean age at death was 11 days (range 1–28 days). Multiple risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome were present in these 12 cases: smoking (10), prematurity (7), and inappropriate sleeping place (8). Five mothers were positive for hepatitis C. The history was inconsistent with the findings in only one case. Conclusion: An unexpectedly high proportion of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly in the first month had a history of maternal substance misuse. All had multiple risk factors, for sudden infant death syndrome many avoidable. We would stress the need to emphasise the ‘Safe Sleep’ message with these families at every contact with health professionals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Brown, Rhonda
T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal variables and postpartum depression, anxiety and stress levels in new mothers. Method: One-hundred-thirty-nine women completed the baseline questionnaire and 105 completed the follow-up questionnaire at 4–6 months postpartum. Sociodemographic and pregnancy factors were assessed at baseline, birth and postnatal factors were assessed at time 2, and depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at both time points. Results: Caesarean delivery was associated with high postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Child sleep problems was related to depression, child health problems were related to anxiety, more SLE related to high stress, and maternal sleep problems were related to PPD. However, the results became non-significant after controlling for antenatal distress levels. Finally, women who underwent caesarean delivery had higher antenatal stress, anxiety, and depression levels, relative to women who did not undergo the procedure. Conclusion: Psychological stress and distress tended to persist in the women from the third-trimester of pregnancy to 4–6 months postpartum. It tended to occur in the context of caesarean delivery, maternal sleep problems, child's health and sleep problems, and stressful life-events.

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Introduction: Maternal antenatal depression is associated with an increased risk of emotional and behavioural problems in children. More recently antenatal depression has been associated with shorter sleep duration, higher number of awakenings and sleep problems in infants. Examining the effect of treatment of depression on child development is the next step in unravelling the complex association between antenatal depression and offspring development. Methods: We used data from a pilot RCT of women with antenatal depression who received either Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), to examine infant sleep duration and temperament two months postpartum. Data was available for n = 14 in the CBT group and n = 11 in the TAU group. Results: No differences by treatment arm were evident. Improvement in depression scores during pregnancy was associated with easier temperament (β = −.45, p = .024) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration (β = −.58, p = .003). The findings were more pronounced in the CBT group compared to the TAU group. Limitations: This was a pilot RCT and as such the sample size was small and there was some loss to follow up between the baseline and postnatal assessment. Conclusion: Improvement in antenatal depressive symptoms may have beneficial effects for the infant; whether these are directly through effects on foetal development or indirectly through changes in the postnatal mother–infant relationship remains to be determined.

AB  - Background: Maternal obesity increases offspring propensity to metabolic dysfunctions and to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. The circadian clock is a transcriptional/epigenetic molecular machinery synchronising physiological processes to coordinate energy utilisation within a 24-h light/dark period. Alterations in rhythmicity have profound effects on metabolic pathways, which we sought to investigate in offspring with programmed NAFLD. Methods: Mice were fed a standard or an obesogenic diet (OD), before and throughout pregnancy, and during lactation. Offspring were weaned onto standard or an OD at 3 weeks postpartum and housed in 12:12 light/dark conditions. Biochemical and histological indicators of NAFLD and fibrosis, analysis of canonical clock genes with methylation status and locomotor activity were investigated at 6 months. Results: We show that maternal obesity interacts with an obesogenic post-weaning diet to promote the development of NAFLD with disruption of canonical metabolic rhythmicity gene expression in the liver. We demonstrate hypermethylation of BMAL-1 (brain and muscle Arnt like-1) and Per2 promoter regions and altered 24-h rhythmicity of hepatic pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators. Conclusions: These data implicate disordered circadian rhythms in NAFLD and suggest that disruption of this system during critical developmental periods may be responsible for the onset of chronic liver disease in adulthood.

AU  - Belot, Rose-Angélique

T2  - Bulletin de Psychologie
AB  - This article presents an original research on the assessment of mentalization including two populations of mothers and their babies. Baby ages, gender, sibling order, social-professional categories of parents and primiparity were matched in the two groups. Physical and psychological experiences during pregnancy, birth and the arrival of the baby in the family all sollicit the mother during the first month, because she must deal with the immaturity of her baby. She must show an ability to exert some containing function. In this context, the mentalization capacities are actively mobilized. In the first group of mothers (i.e., “clinical group”), babies were aged between 1 and 4 months and presented somatic expressions in the areas of sleep, diet, digestion, respiration and skin. The second group of mothers (i.e., “control group”), counted 13 babies matched up, that are who developped normally, without any disorder. The Rorschach test was taken by mothers to assess their capacity for mentalization. Results show that, globally, mothers in the control group had better mentalization activities. An in-depth comparative analysis was applied to two contrasted cases: one case of low-level and one case of high-level of mentalization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Circadian clock regulated gene expression in the hypothalamus.
AU  - Ballance, Heather I.
AB  - The master circadian clock in mammals is the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN). The SCN generates sustained 24 hour rhythms of molecular oscillation and electrical activity, entrains to light, and synchronizes peripheral tissues. The molecular mechanisms involved SCN cell type specific function, rhythm generation, and signaling to and from the periphery remain incompletely understood. To address basic SCN function, we profiled its RNA expression at 2-hour resolution over 48 hours using Affymetrix 1.0ST arrays. We found ~500 cycling transcripts. These data offer crucial insight into circadian regulation of neuronal connectivity, synaptic transmission, ion homeostasis, splicing factors and protein-folding chaperones. We studied the circadian clock's response to metabolic perturbations using control, low protein (LP), or high fat (HF) in utero diet during gestation and weaning. We also studied interaction of in utero and adult diet in mice given a control or LP in utero diet followed by a control or HF adult diet. Adult mice from all diet conditions were analyzed for circadian locomotor activity (tau) using running wheels. Adult HF diet had a greater effect than HF in utero diet of lengthening tau in both male and female mice. LP in utero diet lengthened tau in male mice, but did not affect female mice. Circadian CNS response to these in utero and adult diet conditions was measured using PER2::LUCIFERASE expression in the SCN and a neighboring hypothalamic nucleus regulating feeding and satiety, the arcuate nucleus. Period length of PER2::LUC was not affected by diet in the SCN, but both male and female mice exhibited trends of lowered baseline and amplitude of PER2::LUC in all dietary perturbation conditions compared with controls. In the arcuate, dietary perturbations showed trends of increasing baseline and amplitude of PER2::LUC in male mice, while the opposite effect was seen in females. Overall, our data show extensive circadian regulation of gene expression as well as response to metabolic conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Evaluating Intimate Partner Violence during pregnancy: Prevalence and impact on maternal behaviors and newborn health.
AU  - Rice, Shahida Priscilla
AB  - Background: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a widespread public health problem that not only deteriorates the quality of life for victims and witnesses, but can also prove fatal. Homicide represents the number one cause of death during pregnancy and up to a year postpartum for women in the U.S. For over 300,000 women - or up to 20% of all those pregnant - each year, pregnancy is a time of abuse, violence, and threat of murder. This research aims to conceptualize how the individual, interpersonal, and societal factors that contribute to the ongoing perpetration of intimate partner violence affects the future generation despite not being directly victimized. The aims of this dissertation address the mechanisms by which intimate partner violence and partner-related stress affects the health of a newborn and inform the field of maternal and child health of abuse's indirect impacts. Methods: To evaluate the impact of the Violence Against Women Act since its enactment, a comparison of the reported prevalence rates of intimate partner violence for the years of 1994 and 1995 to 2010 will be conducted (Aim 1). A chi-square test and logistic regression will be used. Results from this aim will provide us with a preliminary analysis of the effect of the legislation. Aim 2 explores the risk factors for women who are victimized by violence as well as the risk factors that may predispose men to wage violence against their partners. Both individual factors as well as interpersonal strife are included. Binary logistic regression models will be used for both the model created for women as well as that of men. Aim 3 utilizes the models created in Aim 2 to evaluate if and how maternal behaviors that directly affect newborn health are impacted by IPV. Women exposed to IPV will be matched to women not exposed to IPV based on propensity scores created that integrate both individual and couple-level risk factors. The matched subjects' maternal behaviors will then be compared via McNemar's Chi-Square Tests. Results: Results from Aim 1 indicate that the prevalence of IPV amongst pregnant women in 1994 and 1995 compared to 2010 is statistically indistinguishable. Aim 2 demonstrated that couple-level factors are far more impactful on the occurrence of IPV than individual-level factors previously established in the literature. Aim 3 exhibits that IPV-exposed mothers are more likely to obtain adequate prenatal care, position infant for safe sleep, and bring newborns to a follow-up appointment. However, IPV exposed mothers are also less likely to ever breastfeed their newborns and far more likely to reports symptoms of postpartum depression. Conclusion: In addition to evaluating the impact of the Violence Against Women Act since its enactment, this dissertation research adds to the literature of violence and injury prevention. Not only does the study add to the research that accounts for risks for victimization, but it also makes a case for the need of a validated construct for interpersonal strife. By integrating interpersonal strife indicators, we are able to add to the holistic view of interpersonal strife and potential red flags for partner violence. As a culminating research objective, Aim 3 illuminates the impact of the experience of violence on maternal behaviors and newborn health. By externalizing the mechanisms by which the mother-infant relationship is compromised, public health professionals and clinicians alike will be able to better understand the impact of partner violence on maternal behaviors that directly affect newborn health, and therefore, design intervention and harm-reduction programs accordingly.

AB  - Objective: Controversies exist regarding the impact of co-sleeping on infant sleep quality. In this context, the current study examined: (a) the differences in objective and subjective sleep patterns between co-sleeping (mostly room-sharing) and solitary sleeping mother–infant dyads; (b) the predictive links between maternal sleep during pregnancy and postnatal sleeping arrangement; (c) the bi-directional prospective associations between sleeping arrangement and infant/maternal sleep quality at three and six months postpartum. Methods: The sample included 153 families recruited during pregnancy. Data were obtained in home settings during the third trimester of pregnancy and at three and six months postpartum. Mothers were asked to monitor their own sleep and their infants’ sleep for five nights using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Questionnaires were used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results: Mothers of co-sleeping infants reported more infant night-wakings than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping group. Moreover, poorer maternal sleep during pregnancy and at three months postpartum predicted higher levels of co-sleeping at six months. Conclusion: Mothers of co-sleeping infants report more infant night-wakings, and experience poorer sleep than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. The quality of maternal sleep should be taken into clinical consideration when parents consult about co-sleeping. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: To determine whether respiratory support via heated humidified high flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) results in infants <32 weeks gestation spending a greater proportion of time in sleep compared to those receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). Methods: A subgroup of infants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to compare HHHFNC or NCPAP postextubation had sleep and wake activity measured by actigraphy for 72 hours post-extubation. Activity diaries were completed contemporaneously to record episodes of infant handling. Actigraphy data were downloaded with known periods of handling excluded from the analysis. Results: 28 infants with mean gestation of 28.3 weeks (SD 2) and birth weight 1074 g (SD 371) were studied. Infants receiving HHHFNC spent a lesser proportion of time in sleep 59.8% (SD 18.5) than those onNCPAP 82.2% (SD 23.8) p = 0.004. Infants receiving HHHFNC had a lower sleep efficiency and higher mean activity score than those on NCPAP (p = 0.003, p = 0.002, respectively). Conclusion: Infants receiving HHHFNC had a higher mean activity score and spent less time in sleep than those allocated NCPAP. Further study of sleep wake activity in preterm infants receiving respiratory support is required as this may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - The secretion of the stress hormone cortisol follows a diurnal circadian rhythm. There are indications that this rhythm is affected by stress early in life. This paper addresses the development of the cortisol circadian rhythm between 1 and 6 years of age, and the role of maternal stress and anxiety early in the child’s life on this (developing) rhythm. Participants were 193 healthy mother-child dyads from a community sample. Self-reported maternal stress and anxiety and physiological stress (saliva cortisol), were assessed prenatally (gestational week 37). Postnatally, self-reported maternal stress and anxiety were measured at 3, 6, 12, 30, and 72 months. Saliva cortisol samples from the children were collected on two days (four times each day) at 12, 30, and 72 months of age. The total amount of cortisol during the day and the cortisol decline over the day were determined to indicate children’s cortisol circadian rhythm. Multilevel analyses showed that the total amount of cortisol decreased between 1 and 6 years. Furthermore, more maternal pregnancy-specific stress was related to higher total amounts of cortisol in the child. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal anxiety were associated with flatter cortisol declines in children. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal daily hassles were associated with steeper child cortisol declines over the day. These results indicated developmental change in children’s cortisol secretion from 1 to 6 years and associations between maternal stress and anxiety early in children’s lives and children’s cortisol circadian rhythm in early childhood.

TI  - What are the relationships among cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, sleep quality, and perinatal outcomes in African-American women?
AU  - Hauff, Nancy J.
AB  - Trauma, primarily in the form of intimate partner violence and automobile accidents, accounts for 6-8% of all pregnancy complications. Much less is known about cumulative trauma (CT) exposure especially in African-American women. Women exposed to several types of trauma including childhood abuse, discrimination, or witnessed family violence may develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress or have difficulty sleeping. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress, sleep, and perinatal outcomes. A sample of 150 essentially healthy African-American women who had given birth were recruited at Hutzel Women's Hospital and St. John Providence Hospital Southfield, and asked to complete the Cumulative Trauma Scale, Community Safety Questionnaire, Conflict Tactics Scale, Clinician-administered PTSD Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Edinburgh Depression Inventory, and Demographic Data Form. The prenatal and hospital medical records were reviewed for multiple maternal and neonatal outcomes. Regression analysis was used to determine if relationships between the variables exist, and the strength of those relationships. The findings of this study showed: 1) African- American women experience traumatic events. 2) cumulative trauma is associated with PTSD, depression, poor sleep quality, and neonatal outcomes; 3) nursing must go beyond the assessment of intimate partner violence, report active trauma, and record findings in the medical record; and 4) more research is needed to better understand mothers' use of over the counter and other medications to help them sleep. The relevance to maternal child health is that a better understanding of cumulative trauma exposure, PTSD, poor sleep, and the risk for poor perinatal outcomes among African-American women can lead to earlier identification and the development of nursing interventions.

AB  - Personality may influence sleep in perinatal women. A follow-up study was conducted among 3,752 pregnant, then postpartum women at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. The Big Five personality dimensions were measured by the Mini-International Personality Item Pool in week 17 of pregnancy. Insomnia was measured by the Bergen Insomnia Scale in pregnancy week 32 and 8 weeks postpartum, along with self-reported sleep times. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale measured depression, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist measured anxiety. Adjusted for current anxiety, depression, and demographic variables, the personality traits Neuroticism and Agreeableness were associated with insomnia in pregnancy. No personality traits were associated with postpartum insomnia. Extraversion was associated with longer postpartum sleep duration and better sleep efficiency, and Agreeableness with shorter sleep duration.

TI  - Sleep and postpartum depression.
AU  - Okun, Michele L.
T2  - Current Opinion in Psychiatry
AB  - Purpose of review: The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is the increased risk for sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence to suggest that women with significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, are more likely to report an increase in depressive symptomatology or develop postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD. Recent findings: Symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep quality are independently associated with greater depressive symptoms across pregnancy and throughout postpartum. Likewise, both can negatively impact the ability to mother effectively. Summary: The presence of insomnia or sleep disturbance during the perinatal period is a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Women with depression are at an increased risk of developing sleep disturbance thereby increasing depressive symptomatology. This bidirectional and additive relationship needs more clinical attention as both sleep disturbance and depression are noted risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy on maternal care and maternal aggression in a rodent model. Methods: Twenty-three female Wistar rats were assigned to one of two groups: control (n = 12) or sleep restriction (n = 11) during the entire pregnancy. At the fifth postpartum day, the animals were subjected to the resident-intruder paradigm and to the pup retrieval test. Results: Sleep restriction during pregnancy had no direct effects on maternal care. Regarding aggressive behavior, defensive aggression was increased by sleep loss, with a lower responsiveness threshold to hostile environmental stimuli. Sleep deprivation during gestation also reduced self-grooming behavior. Conclusion: Taking increased self-grooming as a behavioral correlate of anxiety in rodents, this study provides evidence that lactating dams were in a condition of reduced anxiety. From an adaptive perspective, this pattern of stress response may function to ensure proper maternal behavior, thereby guaranteeing the survival and viability of the litter. Under a translational perspective, the present article confronts the importance of biological and adaptive features to rodent maternal behavior with the relevance of sociocultural factors to the human mother-infant relationship and to the onset of postpartum depression.

TI  - Bearing knowledge: Law, reproduction and the female body in modern Morocco, 1912-present.
AU  - Larson, Satyel K.
AB  - Combining historical, juridical and ethnographic analysis, my dissertation traces a history of evidence of reproductive bodies and the not-yet born in the Maghrib over the course of the last century through a case study of a regional phenomenon known as the "sleeping baby in the mother's womb" ( al-raqid; l-raged; bu mergud). Women with sleeping babies experience pregnancies that can last for years beyond the standard nine months accepted in Western law and medicine. According to the belief in the sleeping baby, a sudden traumatic experience or the return of menstrual blood can arrest the development of a fetus in the womb. The fetus will then "sleep" in the womb---"neither living nor dead"---for an indefinite period of time until it is awoken by another traumatic shock, sexual intercourse, or spiritual and herbal treatments. As a legal doctrine in Islamic law, the sleeping baby admitted protracted pregnancies lasting up to five, and in some cases seven, years after conception. Prior to the codification of Islamic family law between 1957-9, which banished the sleeping baby from official law, the sleeping baby phenomenon and discourse addressed the intersection of the psycho-biological and socio-legal aspects of human reproduction. The biological aspects include false or "hysterical" pregnancies (i.e., pseudocyesis), abortion induced by the mother, ectopic pregnancies, and various kinds of miscarriages--both those that are expelled from the mother's uterus and those that are retained--as well as viable, full-term pregnancies in which women give birth to a living baby. The socio-legal aspects include claims to paternity, contestations of paternity, inheritance disputes, spousal and child maintenance claims, adultery, and the status of the children of slave mothers (um walad), and free mothers based on their marital situation. The discourse of the sleeping baby enabled women to express any of the various contingent combinations that could arise from these biological and social contingencies. The dissertation knits together detailed archival analysis of selected published and unpublished family and criminal law cases in French and Arabic from the colonial and postcolonial periods, with ethnographic data gathered from participant observation and extensive interviewing in courts and a public maternity hospital in urban Morocco. In my analysis, I track and examine the diverse forms of evidence in colonial Islamic law (1912-1959) and post-colonial state family law (1959-present) that have taken reproductive bodies and the not-yet born as objects of legal knowledge---a process I term "legal embodiment." By legal embodiment, I mean how human reproductive bodies and their bodily materials emerge in and from historical forms of law, as viable evidentiary objects carrying signifying force. Legal embodiments indicate how reproductive bodies interact with, emerge from and are given value by particular geo-historically circumscribed knowledge, authority and technologies. From women's testimony about their own bodies and midwives' sensory expertise in colonial Islamic courts, to visualizing biomedical technology and DNA testing in postcolonial state family law courts---the diverse set of bodily evidence reveals how diverse legalities that regulate women's reproduction intersect with knowledge, technologies and authority under colonial and post-colonial political-economic power. By tracing legal embodiments, I show how evidence and expertise in Moroccan law have transformed women with sleeping babies from legally-viable reproductive bodies to extra-legal unproductive bodies. Extra-legal embodiment indexes historically minor discourses and practices that law does not value as evidence, and which are deemed irrelevant in law's bodily valuations.

Tuna Burgut, Abdulbari Bener, Suheila Ghuloum and Javaid Sheikh (Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics & Gynecology, 2013[Jun], Vol 34[2], 90-97). In the original article, the authors omitted the following reference: Bener A, Burgut FT, Ghuloum S, Sheikh J. A study of postpartum depression in a fast developing country: prevalence and related factors. Int J Psychiat Med 2012;43:325–337. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-19649-006). Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p = 0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.

AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS) are systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affect woman of child-bearing-age. Pregnancies in these patients are often complicated by prematurity, related to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Maternal aPL (IgG isotype) could theoretically reach fetal brain. Whether this can have an effect on brain, influencing neurodevelopment is still debated. Objectives: To evaluate the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in children born to mothers with SLE or APS in order to recognize potential risk factors. Methods: We included children born to mothers with SLE or APS with IgG anti-ß2GPI positivity during pregnancy. We investigated 40 children (median age 7,5 years-old). The evaluation was performed as follow: questionnaires regarding neuroedevelopmental history and behaviour, clinical and cognitive evaluation; when necessary instrumental and neuropsychological investigations were assessed. Results: We identified sleep disorders (30%), behavioural or mood problems (32%), specific learning disorders (12,5%) and epilepsy (10%). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Uncontrolled studies in human have suggested that memantine might be a suitable option for migraine prophylaxis. Objective: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of memantine for migraine prophylaxis. Methods: This was a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Sixty patients with migraine without aura were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive memantine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline in the monthly attack frequency at week 12 between the two groups (using migraine diary). Secondary efficacy measures were assessed using several clinical, functional, and psychological instruments. We performed both complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat analyses (ITT). Results: Twenty-five patients in the memantine group and 27 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Patients in the memantine group showed significantly greater reduction (mean change; 3.4; 95%CI, 2.3-4.4) in the monthly attack frequency than the placebo group (mean change, 1.0; 95%CI, 0.3-1.7) (mean difference [MD], 2.3; 95%CI, 1.1-3.5, P P < .01). Patients in the memantine group experienced greater reduction in the number of work absence days, severity, and disability score than the patients in the placebo group in both ITT and CC analyses. Changes in quality of life, sleep, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups. Three patients in the memantine group complained of sedation, mild vertigo and nausea, and drowsiness. In the placebo group, one patient complained of nausea and another patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to vertigo. Conclusion: Memantine might be a tolerable and efficacious option for prophylaxis in patients with migraine without aura. Tolerability, short duration required for titration, and safety profile in pregnancy might give memantine an advantage over other antimigraine medications.

TI  - Growing up in Ireland: Factors impacting sleep patterns of preterm infants.
AU  - Fallon, Joanne
AB  - Preterm infants represent the largest child patient group in the European Union (EU), accounting for 5.5-11.4% of all births (European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants, 2011b). Preterm birth is defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation. Infants born late preterm (34-36 weeks) are considered more similar to early preterm (> 34 weeks) than to full-term infants, despite previously regarded as near-term (Raju Higgins, Stark, & Leveno, 2006). For preterm infants, sleeping functions are critical as they demonstrate the ability to adjust to biological and social rhythms and support emotional regulation, learning, and memory. Many studies have focused on sleep patterns of full-term infants; however, few have investigated preterm infants and none have compared early and late preterm infants with a population from the Republic of Ireland. The purpose of this study was to identify infant and parent characteristics that promote optimal sleep in preterm infants and to establish whether the parent-infant relationship mediates this association. A secondary purpose was to test the transactional model of sleep. Parent report of infant sleep was taken from a recent population-based dataset from the Republic of Ireland. A comparison of the day and nighttime sleep patterns of early and late preterm infants found no difference between groups. There was also no difference in infant temperament, breast-feeding, parental stress, depression, or sociodemographics. A difference was found between groups in infant development, weight at 9 months, and age infant began solid foods. This finding was not surprising as infants born early preterm are at greater at greater risk of developmental delay and disability. Results of this study suggest that the paternal-infant relationship has a mediating impact on the relationship between infant temperament and nighttime waking in the early preterm group only, while the maternal-infant relationship has a mediating role in both groups. These findings add to the body of knowledge on the transactional model of sleep, and are the first to identify infant temperament and the paternal-infant relationship as important factors. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the transactional model of sleep and recommendations for future research are presented.

TI  - Mirtazapine in pregnancy and lactation—A systematic review.
AU  - Smit, Mirte
AU  - Dolman, Koert M.
AU  - Honig, A.
T2  - European Neuropsychopharmacology
AB  - Depression is common in pregnancy and associated with increased risk of adverse effects for the neonate. Treatment and prevention options include antidepressant therapy. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on safety of mirtazapine during pregnancy and lactation. In 31 papers a total of 390 cases of neonates exposed to mirtazapine during pregnancy or lactation have been described. There might be an association between mirtazapine and spontaneous abortion, however, this might be attributable to underlying psychiatric disease. An increased risk of major neonatal malformations associated with mirtazapine in pregnancy has not been reported. Although one study showed a nearly significant increase in occurrence of respiratory problems and hypoglycaemia, no indication of causality could be given. No other significant adverse effects on neonates were reported. Limited available data, four papers on 11 exposed neonates, suggest that use of mirtazapine during breastfeeding is safe due to a low relative infant dose. High plasma levels might be associated with increased body weight and sleep. However, the reported data are too scarce to come to a clear assessment of the risk of mirtazapine in lactation. No information is available on the use of mirtazapine in pregnancy and Poor Neonatal Adaptation Syndrome (PNAS) or neurobehavioral development at an age over one year. In conclusion, mirtazapine seems to be safe in pregnancy, especially regarding incidence of congenital malformations. There are not enough data available to come to a conclusion on the safety of mirtazapine during lactation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Childhood abuse is associated with increased risks of adult psychiatric disorders and physical health conditions. Mounting evidence documents associations of childhood abuse with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, to date, no study has evaluated associations of childhood abuse and sleep disturbances among pregnant women. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. To collect information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, history of childhood abuse, and complaints of sleep disturbances, face-to-face interviews were conducted with women in early pregnancy. Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST-S) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-S), translated from English to Spanish, were used to assess stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: Women who experienced any childhood abuse had a 1.65-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.15–2.38) and 2.11-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.35–3.30) as compared with women who reported no abuse. Women who reported both physical and sexual abuse during childhood were more than twice as likely to suffer from stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.44–3.53) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.45–4.09) in comparison to women who reported no childhood abuse. Conclusions: A history of childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. These findings, if replicated, should be used to inform the development of trauma-informed care for such sleep disturbances induced by childhood trauma.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate trajectories of sleep quality and associations with mood in the perinatal period. Although it is commonly accepted that subjective sleep quality declines during pregnancy and the transition to parenthood, some women may follow qualitatively distinct trajectories. Design, Setting, and Participants: Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected from 293 women at four time points: during early pregnancy, at Time 1 (T1; < 22 w gestational age [GA]; late pregnancy, at Time 2 (T2; 32 w GA); during the postnatal period at Time 3 (T3; 3 mo postpartum); and Time 4 (T4; 6 mo postpartum). A group-based semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate patterns of sleep quality throughout the perinatal period. Results: Four trajectory groups were identified, including patterns defined by high sleep quality throughout (21.5%), mild decrease in sleep quality (59.5%), significant decrease in sleep quality (12.3%) and a group with poor sleep quality throughout (6.7%). Women who had the worst sleep quality at Time 1 and those who experienced significant increases in sleep problems throughout pregnancy were also the groups who reported the highest levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and the lowest levels of social support. After controlling for covariates, the groups with worst subjective sleep quality during pregnancy were also the most likely to experience high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period. Conclusions: Most of the women in our sample reported mild sleep disturbances through the perinatal period. A subgroup of women reported a significant decline in sleep quality from early to late pregnancy and another reported poor subjective sleep quality throughout pregnancy; these groups had the greatest risk of experiencing high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.

T2  - Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research
AB  - Study Objectives: Poor sleep promotes inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the United States, a persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans showing ~1.5 times greater risk. This study examined associations among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women. Design: Observational. Measurements: Women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other psychosocial and behavioral measures during midpregnancy. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined by high-sensitivity assays. Birth outcomes were determined via medical record review. Results: Among African American women (n = 79), shorter gestation was predicted by poorer overall sleep (rs = −0.35, P = 0.002) as well the following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (rs = −0.34, P = 0.002), sleep latency (rs = −0.27, P = 0.02), and sleep efficiency (rs = −0.27, P = 0.02). African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 10.2 times the odds of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among European American women (n = 53), gestational length was not significantly predicted by sleep quality (Ps > 0.12). Bootstrapping analyses showed that, among African Americans, IL-8 significantly mediated the association between sleep quality and length of gestation (indirect effect estimate −0.029; 95% confidence interval −0.06, −0.002). Conclusions: The data provide novel evidence that African American women exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep disturbance than European American women and these effects correspond with length of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep induced immune dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Hormones and Behavior
AB  - Jay Rosenblatt effectively promoted research on rabbit maternal behavior through his interaction with colleagues in Mexico. Here we review the activities of pregnant and lactating rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), their neuro-hormonal regulation, and the synchronization of behavior between mother and kits. Changing concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin throughout gestation regulate nest-building (digging, straw-carrying, fur-pulling) and prime the mother's brain to respond to the newborn. Nursing is the only mother–young contact throughout lactation. It happens once/day, inside the nest, with ca. 24h periodicity, and lasts around 3min. Periodicity and duration of nursing depend on a threshold of suckling as procedures reducing the amount of nipple stimulation interfere with the temporal aspects of nursing, though not with the doe's maternal motivation. Synchronization between mother and kits, critical for nursing, relies on: a) the production of pheromonal cues which guide the young to the mother's nipples for suckling; b) an endogenous circadian rhythm of anticipatory activity in the young, present since birth. Milk intake entrains the kits' locomotor behavior, corticosterone secretion, and the activity of several brain structures. Sibling interactions within the huddle, largely determined by body mass at birth, are important for: a) maintaining body temperature; b) ensuring normal neuromotor and social development. Suckling maintains nursing behavior past the period of abundant milk production but abrupt and efficient weaning occurs in concurrently pregnant-lactating does by unknown factors. Conclusion: female rabbits have evolved a reproductive strategy largely dissociating maternal care from maternal presence, whose multifactorial regulation warrants future investigations.

T2  - Clinical Psychologist
AB  - Background: Perimenopause is associated with increased depression symptoms in women. Symptoms at this time are thought to be qualitatively different from those in childbearing years, and to present with milder symptoms of depression, increased agitation, and fatigue. This research aimed to determine whether depressive symptoms during perimenopause can be distinguished from those in the childbearing years. Methods: Seventy‐four depressed women who were either perimenopausal (n = 40) or in their childbearing years (n = 34) were recruited (M = 40.11; SD = 11 years). Participants completed a series of questionnaires relating to depression (Beck Depression Inventory‐II), various mood states (Profile of Mood States), and changes in sleep patterns. Results: Univariate relationships between symptoms and perimenopausal status were assessed. All significant variables (anger‐hostility, depression, tension‐anxiety, fatigue‐inertia, and changes in sleep quality) were analysed via logistic regression. Mood profile at these two different life stages were differentiated based on lower levels of depression symptoms and tension‐anxiety, and increased levels of anger‐hostility, fatigue‐inertia, and sleep disturbance in the perimenopausal women as compared with the childbearing group. Conclusions: This research supports the unique presentation of perimenopausal depression. The identification of a unique symptomatic profile provides targets for intervention and allows for different treatment options. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1324 women who were recruited during early pregnancy. Migraine diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep-related characteristics including sleep duration, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and other sleep traits. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Migraineurs were more likely than non-migraineurs to report short sleep duration (5) (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.35–2.23), and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.12–2.02). Migraineurs were also more likely than non-migraineurs to report taking sleep medication during pregnancy (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.20–2.42). Associations were generally similar for migraine with or without aura. The odds of sleep disturbances were particularly elevated among pre-pregnancy overweight migraineurs. Conclusion: Migraine headache and sleep disturbances are common comorbid conditions among pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: A number of studies have established an association between antenatal maternal depression and infant sleep. One key question is whether all infants are equally susceptible to environmental influences, including the intrauterine environment. Reactive temperament has been examined as a plasticity factor, with accumulating evidence suggesting that infants with reactive temperament may be more susceptible to both positive and negative environmental influences. This study examines whether infant reactivity moderates any association between antenatal depression and infant sleep in 2 longitudinal studies: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Generation R cohorts. Methods: Maternal depression scores were assessed during pregnancy using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Infant sleep duration and awakenings, in ALSPAC (N = 8318) and Generation R (N = 2241), were assessed at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Infant reactivity was assessed by temperament questionnaire at 6 months of age. Results: Hierarchical linear regression models indicated a 3-way interaction between reactivity and gender moderating the effect of antenatal depression on infant sleep, on sleep duration in Generation R at 24 months (β = .085, p p = .030), and on night awakenings at 18 months in ALSPAC (β = 2.085, p = .013). Boys with more reactive temperament exhibited shorter sleep duration and a higher number of awakenings when previously exposed to maternal symptoms of antenatal depression. Conclusion: For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.

The open-label pilot study (exploratory) was performed at the University Hospital of Zürich and the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland (Lugano). Patient and Methods: Nineteen women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-to-severe RLS and serum ferritin levels P P P < 0.029), and treatment was well tolerated. Three serious adverse events were reported, but they were considered unrelated to treatment. Conclusions: These data provide promising evidence on the safety and efficacy of FCM for moderate-to-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anemia. Therefore, a future placebo-controlled study is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Newer generation antidepressant drugs (ADs) are widely used as the first line of treatment for major depressive disorders and are considered to be safer than tricyclic agents. In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation, but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia), hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes, risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus, the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks, likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to consider alternative treatments if available.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is common during pregnancy, affecting approximately one in five pregnant women in Western countries. Many report moderate or severe symptoms and negative impact on sleep. There is very little information in the medical literature for practitioners on the management of this condition during pregnancy. Accordingly, a task force was chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. A committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12 consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including reassurance, exercise and avoidance of exacerbating factors, are outlined. A rationale for iron supplementation is presented. Medications for RLS/WED are risk/benefit rated for use during pregnancy and lactation. A few are rated “may be considered” when RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches. An algorithm summarizes the recommendations. These guidelines are intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sleep and sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as determinants of women's health and well-being, particularly in the context of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. At present, however, little is known about whether fertility is affected by sleep quantity and quality. That is, to what degree, and by what mechanisms, do sleep and/or its disturbances affect fertility? The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about sleep disturbances in relation to reproductive capacity. A model is provided, whereby stress, sleep dysregulation, and circadian misalignment are delineated for their potential relevance to infertility. Ultimately, if it is the case that sleep disturbance is associated with infertility, new avenues for clinical intervention may be possible.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of non-violent, gender-based forms of maltreatment of women by husbands and in-laws [i.e., gender-based household maltreatment (GBHM)] during pregnancy and postpartum; to clarify the role of GBHM in compromising infant health, and whether this role extends beyond that previously observed for intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: Cross-sectional, quantitative data were collected from women (ages 15–35) seeking immunizations for their infants <6 months of age (N = 1061) in urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between maternal abuse (perinatal IPV, in-law violence and GBHM) and recent infant morbidity (diarrhea, respiratory distress, fever, colic and vomiting). Results: More than one in four women (28.4 %) reported IPV during their recent pregnancy and/or during the postpartum period, 2.6 % reported perinatal violence from in-laws, and 49.0 % reported one or more forms of perinatal GBHM. In adjusted regression models that included all forms of family violence and maltreatment, perinatal GBHM remained significantly associated with infant morbidity (AORs 1.4–1.9); perinatal IPV and in-law violence ceased to predict infant morbidity in models including GBHM. Conclusions: Findings indicate that non-violent expressions of gender inequity (e.g., nutritional deprivation, deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care during pregnancy) are more strongly associated with poor infant health than physical or sexual violence from husbands or in-laws in urban India. These results strongly suggest the need to expand the conception of gender inequities beyond IPV to include non-violent forms of gendered mistreatment in considering their impact on infant health.

T2  - Fetal development: Research on brain and behavior, environmental influences, and emerging technologies.
AB  - In this chapter, we focus on the assessment of the integrity and activity of the fetal central nervous system (CNS). Therefore it is necessary to understand normal behavior and which variables can be used to assess that (e.g., eye and body movements). Furthermore, one needs to understand the (neuro)developmental pathway during gestation, as a “younger” fetus shows different behavior compared to the “older” fetus. Behavioral states or sleep states are present at the end of gestation, and even wakefulness occurs independent of birth. These states are defined on the basis of three state criteria: cardiotocographic pattern, presence or absence of body, and eye movements. As in neonatal life, we would like to “test” the CNS, rather than make observations of behavior alone, but we are limited. The intercostal-to-phrenic inhibitory reflex is explained as well as fetal habituation as a measure for fetal memory. We conclude that it still remains difficult to perform a prenatal neurologic examination. It is quite likely that no single, isolated aspect of behavior alone will evolve to conduct a fetal neurologic investigation, but rather a combination of (behavioral) tests.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether depressive symptoms predict anxiety and stress or whether anxiety and stress precede depressive symptoms in fathers during the antenatal period. Background: The findings of previous studies suggest that there is an association between paternal depression, anxiety and stress during the antenatal period. However, the temporal inter-relationship between these variables has yet to be investigated. Method: Data were collected from 150 expectant couples at approximately 18, 25 and 33 weeks’ gestation. Results: After accounting for the relative stability of depression, anxiety and stress over time, for men higher levels of anxiety earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depression and stress in middle pregnancy, which predicted higher depression during late pregnancy. A similar relationship remained after partialling out the effects of partner’s depression, perceived social support and sleep quality. Further analyses also revealed significant differences in the manifestation of distress symptoms between men and women, but not between first-time and non-first-time fathers. Conclusion: Our findings indicated a possible inter-relationship between depression, anxiety and stress for men antenatally. Our findings also showed that men who reported elevated depression, anxiety and stress earlier in the antenatal period also reported elevated symptomology at later time points. Finally, the current findings revealed that antenatal paternal stress may play a key role in the development of depression and anxiety later in pregnancy. Therefore, it may be important to screen for early levels of antenatal stress in men, as well as depression and anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article is part of a Special Issue "Estradiol and cognition". Subjective changes in concentration and memory are commonly reported by women during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy, but the nature of the problem is poorly understood. We hypothesized that these self-reports might reflect difficulties in working memory (WM). It was further hypothesized that antepartum depression (depression arising during pregnancy) may play an etiological role, either on its own or due to secondary changes in endocrine function or sleep. Using WM tasks that emphasized executive control processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) we compared pregnant women tested at 34–36 weeks of gestation (n = 28) with age- and education-matched non-pregnant controls (n = 26). All pregnant women were screened for depression. Evidence of a WM disturbance was found, and was evident only among pregnant women showing depressive symptoms. In contrast, pregnant women who were not depressed showed WM performance that equalled, or even significantly exceeded, non-pregnant controls. No significant differences were observed on control tests of other cognitive functions. Multiple regression revealed that serum estradiol concentrations, along with severity of depressive affect but not sleep disruption, significantly predicted variation in the WM scores. In agreement with studies of estradiol and WM in other contexts, higher estradiol was associated with better WM, while higher levels of depressive symptoms predicted poorer WM. We conclude that memory disturbance during gestation might not be as widespread as commonly believed, but can be seen among women experiencing antepartum depression. The high level of WM performance found in healthy, non-depressed, pregnant women is discussed from an adaptationist perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the book, Nighttime Breastfeeding: American Cultural Dilemma by Cecilia Tomori (2014). In the book Nighttime Breastfeeding: An American Cultural Dilemma, Cecilia Tomori investigates one of the most intimate areas of social life that is by nature unseen and is rarely shared with others. Tomori uses ethnographic research methods to follow nighttime breastfeeding and sleep experiences among middle-class American families experiencing the birth of their first child from late pregnancy until the baby’s first birthday, skillfully bringing together two fields of research that have rarely been studied at the same time. Throughout the book, Tomori remains committed to uncovering the socio-economic inequality that exists among mothers in America based on class and racial stratification. Tomori concludes by suggesting that breastfeeding advocacy that includes recommendations for safe co-sleeping is key in providing effective breastfeeding support in the United States. Tomori points to sexuality as an area pertaining to breastfeeding and nighttime sleep that remains unexplored in the literature but that is likely to play a key role in furthering our understanding of how and why parents choose the breastfeeding and sleep strategies they do.

T2  - Development of normal fetal movements: The last 15 weeks of gestation.
AB  - In the later stages of gestation, fetal functions undergo increasing change and development, preparing the fetus for the transition to its potential environment. Rapid maturation is witnessed in breathing, swallowing, sensory functions, sleep, and many other processes, with corresponding behavioral changes. By 35 to 40 weeks of gestation, fetuses are capable of living ex utero without support, but it is increasingly appreciated that even infants born at between 35 and 36 weeks can suffer long-term consequences. This book, which complements the author's previous volume on development of normal fetal movements during the first 25 weeks of gestation, discusses in detail the full range of behavioral phenomena observed during the final 15 weeks of gestation, with careful analysis of their mutual relationships. A key feature is the outstanding photographic material, difficult to obtain at this late stage, and the instructive graphs that are also included. The information provided will alert clinicians to deviations from the norm and to physiologic phenomena that can turn pathologic in infants born prematurely.

AB  - Hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy, and studies show that pregnant women are more likely to suffer from restless legs syndrome (RLS). Pregnant women with hypertension and RLS often experience disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the nervous system. The present study aimed to clarify the relationship between hypertension and RLS in pregnant women, and their impact on sleep. We enrolled 3,781 pregnant women who were admitted at our hospital for delivery between May 2011 and May 2014. The face-to-face questionnaire used to gather data included the International RLS Study Group criteria for diagnosis, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and hypertension diagnosis. Depending on the time of occurrence of hypertension, it was divided into two different types: pregnancy-induced hypertension and chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Out of 3,781 patients, 453 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for RLS and 486 met the diagnostic criteria for hypertension. Among patients with RLS, prophylactic iron supplementation was less frequently taken during pregnancy. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, rather than chronic hypertension in pregnancy, was found to be more frequent in patients with RLS; pregnant women with RLS had higher PSQI and ESS scores than pregnant controls. In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant women, especially in those without prophylactic iron supplementation. Patients with RLS described more serious sleep disruption and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). In addition, pregnancy-induced hypertension was more common in patients with RLS.

AB  - This dissertation examines women's choices regarding reproduction, sexual activity, and marriage in an economic framework. The first two chapters address the impact of the "biological clock" on women's marriage market outcomes, and thus its implications for career decisions. Women's ability to have children declines sharply with age. This fecundity loss may negatively affect marital prospects for women who delay marriage to make career investments. In chapter 1, I incorporate depreciating "reproductive capital" into a frictionless matching model of the marriage market, where high-skilled women are likely to make pre-marital career investments. When the fertility costs of these investments are large relative to the income gains, the model predicts non-assortative matching at the top of the income distribution, with the highest-earning men forgoing the highest-earning women in favor of poorer, but younger, partners. However, if women's incomes rise or desired family size falls, high-skilled women may be able to compensate their partners for lower fertility, leading to assortative matching. Historical patterns in US Census data are consistent with these predictions. In the 1920-1950 birth cohorts, women with post-bachelors education match with lower-income spouses than women with only college degrees, while in recent years this pattern has reversed. The model relies on men internalizing their partners' expected fertility when choosing a mate. In chapter 2, I test this premise using an online experiment where age is randomly assigned to dating profiles, to control for other factors (such as beauty) that change with age in observational data. I find that men, in contrast to women, have a strong preference for younger partners, but only when they have no children of their own and are aware of the age-fertility tradeoff. Chapter 3 addresses another decision, protecting against unintended pregnancy, in the context of the introduction of a new technology that can prevent pregnancy after intercourse. Emergency contraception (EC) can prevent pregnancy after sex, but only if taken within 72 hours of intercourse. Over the past 15 years, access to EC has been expanded at both the state and federal level. We find that expanded access to EC has had no statistically significant effect on birth or abortion rates. Expansions of access, however, have changed the venue in which the drug is obtained, shifting its provision from hospital emergency departments to pharmacies. We find evidence that this shift may have led to a decrease in reports of sexual assault. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent hypoxia and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown whether intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA modifies male fertility. We tested the hypothesis that male fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA in a mouse model. Design: Case-control comparison in a murine model. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: Eighteen F1 (C57BL/6xCBA) male mice. Interventions: Mice were subjected to a pattern of periodic hypoxia (20 sec at 5% O2 followed by 40 sec of room air) 6 h/day for 60 days or normoxia. After this period, mice performed a mating trial to determine effective fertility by assessing the number of pregnant females and fetuses. Measurements and Results: After euthanasia, oxidative stress in testes was assessed by measuring the expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sperm motility was determined by Integrated Semen Analysis System (ISAS). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased testicular oxidative stress, showing a reduction in the expression of Gpx1 and Sod1 by 38.9% and 34.4%, respectively, as compared with normoxia (P < 0.05). Progressive sperm motility was significantly reduced from 27.0 ± 6.4% in normoxia to 12.8 ± 1.8% in the intermittent hypoxia group (P = 0.04). The proportion of pregnant females and number of fetuses per mating was significantly lower in the intermittent hypoxia group (0.33 ± 0.10 and 2.45 ± 0.73, respectively) than in normoxic controls (0.72 ± 0.16 and 5.80 ± 1.24, respectively). Conclusions: These results suggest that the intermittent hypoxia associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could induce fertility reduction in male patients with this sleep breathing disorder.

TI  - Quetiapine in postpartum psychosis.
AU  - Gobbi, Gabriella
T2  - Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology
AB  - Presents 2 different cases of postpartum psychosis (PP), with different psychopathological presentations, both successfully treated with quetiapine. F.F. was 34 years old at the time of her first pregnancy, suffering from bipolar disorder, type I. The disease was first diagnosed at the age of 27 years, and she was successfully treated and stabilized with valproate (1000 mg/d) and quetiapine (200 mg/d). With the agreement of her psychiatrist, she decided not to take any medication during the pregnancy. The pregnancy went well; in the third trimester, the patient showed light depressive symptoms, which were treated with supportive psychotherapy. Two days after a noncomplicated vaginal delivery, the patient came back home and started breastfeeding. On the third day, she developed severe insomnia, religious delusions, disorganized speech, and word salad. The symptoms prevented her from taking care of her daughter’s basic needs. A.G. was 37 years old at the time of her first delivery, with a history of fibromyalgia and dysthymia. One week after the delivery, she developed symptoms of postpartum depression with anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, restlessness, and emotional liability. The anxiety worsened after her 1-month-old daughter developed severe infant sleep apnea, requiring immediate hospitalization and resuscitation. Two months after the delivery, the patient consulted her general practitioner (GP), complaining of paranoid delusions, excessive concerns about the baby’s health, and depersonalization. The GP prescribed risperidone (2 mg) and desvenlafaxine (50mg),with no significant improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: To compare the prevalence of self-reported abnormal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness in pregnancy among Māori (indigenous New Zealanders) and non-Māori women versus the general population, and to examine the influence of socio-demographic factors. Methods: Self-reported total sleep time (TST) in 24-hrs, Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and socio-demographic information were obtained from nullipara and multipara women aged 20–46 yrs at 35–37 weeks pregnant (358 Māori and 717 non-Māori), and women in the general population (381 Māori and 577 non-Māori). Results: After controlling for ethnicity, age, socio-economic status, and employment status, pregnant women average 30 min less TST than women in the general population. The distribution of TST was also greater in pregnant women, who were 3 times more likely to be short sleepers (≤ 6 h) and 1.9 times more likely to be long sleepers (> 9 h). In addition, pregnant women were 1.8 times more likely to report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Pregnant women > 30 years of age experienced greater age-related declines in TST. Identifying as Māori, being unemployed, and working at night increased the likelihood of reporting abnormal sleep duration across all women population in this study. EDS also more likely occurred among Māori women and women who worked at night. Conclusions: Pregnancy increases the prevalence of abnormal sleep duration and EDS, which are also higher among Māori than non-Māori women and those who do night work. Health professionals responsible for the care of pregnant women need to be well-educated about the importance of sleep and discuss sleep issues with the women they care for.

AB  - The mammalian circadian system develops gradually during ontogenesis, and after birth, the system is already set to a phase of the mothers. The role of maternal melatonin in the entrainment of fetal circadian clocks has been suggested, but direct evidence is lacking. In our study, intact or pinealectomized pregnant rats were exposed to constant light (LL) throughout pregnancy to suppress the endogenous melatonin and behavioral rhythms. During the last 5 days of gestation, the rats were injected with melatonin or vehicle or were left untreated. After delivery, daily expression profiles of c‐fos and Avp in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), and Per1, Per2, Rev‐erbα, and Bmal1 in the liver were measured in 1‐day‐old pups. Due to the LL exposure, no gene expression rhythms were detected in the SCN of untreated pregnant rats or in the SCN and liver of the pups. The administration of melatonin to pregnant rats entrained the pups' gene expression profiles in the SCN, but not in the liver. Melatonin did not affect the maternal behavior during pregnancy. Vehicle injections also synchronized the gene expression in the SCN but not in the liver. Melatonin and vehicle entrained the gene expression profiles to different phases, demonstrating that the effect of melatonin was apparently not due to the treatment procedure per se. The data demonstrate that in pregnant rats with suppressed endogenous melatonin levels, pharmacological doses of melatonin affect the fetal clock in the SCN but not in the liver.

AB  - Physical activity is associated with improved sleep quality and duration in the general population, but its effect on sleep in postpartum women is unknown. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between hours/week of self-reported domain-specific and overall moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep quality and duration at 3- and 12-months postpartum among a cohort of 530 women in the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Postpartum Study. MVPA was not associated with sleep quality or duration at 3-months postpartum. At 12-months postpartum, a 1 h/week increase in recreational MVPA was associated with higher odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (odds ratio, OR 1.14; 95 % confidence interval, CI, 1.03–1.27) and a 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA was associated with lower odds of good (vs. poor) sleep quality (OR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.88–0.99). A 1 h/week increase in child/adult care MVPA (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00–1.16) was associated with higher odds of long sleep duration and 1 h/week increases in indoor household (OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.01–1.18) and overall MVPA (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01–1.07) were associated with higher odds of short (vs. normal) sleep duration. Comparing 3-months postpartum to 12-months postpartum, increased work MVPA was associated with good sleep quality (OR 2.40, 95 % CI 1.12–5.15) and increased indoor household MVPA was associated with short sleep duration (OR 1.85, 95 % CI 1.05–3.27) as measured at 12-months postpartum. Selected domains of MVPA and their longitudinal increases were associated with sleep quality and duration at 12-months postpartum. Additional research is needed to elucidate whether physical activity can improve postpartum sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research
AB  - Background: Excessive sleep fragmentation (SF) is common in pregnant women. Adult-onset metabolic disorders may begin during early development and exhibit substantial sex dimorphism. We hypothesized that metabolic dysfunction induced by gestational SF in male mice would not be apparent in female littermates. Methods: Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly in male and female offspring after late gestational SF or control sleep (SC). At 20 weeks, plasma leptin, adiponectin, lipid profiles, and insulin and glucose tolerance tests were assessed. Leptin and adiponectin, M1, and M2 macrophage messenger RNA expression and polarity were examined. Adiponectin gene promoter methylation levels in several tissues were assessed. Results: Food intake, body weight, visceral fat mass, and insulin resistance were higher, and adiponectin levels lower in male but not female offspring exposed to gestational SF. However, dyslipidemia was apparent in both male and female offspring exposed to SF, albeit of lesser magnitude. In visceral fat, leptin messenger RNA expression was selectively increased and adiponectin expression was decreased in male offspring exposed to gestational SF, but adiponectin was increased in exposed female offspring. Differences in adipokine expression also emerged in liver, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. Increased M1 macrophage markers were present in male offspring exposed to SF (SFOM) while increased M2 markers emerged in SF in female offspring (SFOF). Similarly, significant differences emerged in the methylation patterns of adiponectin promoter in SFOM and SFOF. Conclusion: Gestational sleep fragmentation increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in male but not in female offspring, most likely via epigenetic changes. Thus, sleep perturbations impose long-term detrimental effects to the fetus manifesting as sex dimorphic metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

AU  - Beijers, Roseriet

AU  - de Weerth, Carolina
T2  - European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
AB  - Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that maternal psychosocial stress and anxiety during pregnancy adversely affect child outcomes. However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental functioning, including the 11β-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines, compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the fetus.

T2  - British Journal of Health Psychology
AB  - Objectives. Post‐partum weight retention (PWR) has been identified as a critical pathway for long‐term overweight and obesity. In recent years, psychological factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and maintaining PWR. Design. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between post‐partum psychological distress and PWR at 9 months, after controlling for maternal weight factors, sleep quality, sociocontextual influences, and maternal behaviours. Method. Pregnant women (N = 126) completed a series of questionnaires at multiple time points from early pregnancy until 9 months post‐partum. Results. Hierarchical regression indicated that gestational weight gain, shorter duration (6 months or less) of breastfeeding, and post‐partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months are associated with higher PWR at 9 months; stress, depression, and anxiety had minimal influence. Conclusion. Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should specifically target the prevention of body dissatisfaction and excessive weight gain during pregnancy. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Post‐partum weight retention (PWR) is a critical pathway for long‐term overweight and obesity. Causes of PWR are complex and multifactorial. There is increasing evidence that psychological factors play a key role in predicting high PWR. What does this study add? Post‐partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months is associated with PWR at 9 months post‐birth. Post‐partum depression, stress and anxiety have less influence on PWR at 9 months. Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should target body dissatisfaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between postpartum depression (PPD), infantile colic (IC) and different psychosocial variables, psychiatric symptoms, attachment style and perceived social support in expecting parents. Method: Two hundred forty five expecting mothers and 150 expecting fathers were first interviewed between the 22-34 weeks of pregnancy. Sociodemografic data form, Adult Attachment Style Scale (AASS), State Anxiety Inventory (SAI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were filled out by each expecting parent. Second interview was conducted between the postpartum 4-24 weeks. Data form consisting health, nutrition, sleep and crying problems of the infant and EPDS and SAI were filled out by mothers and SAI by fathers. Results: One in every four mothers had PPD symptoms above the threshold on EPDS. Maternal and paternal insecure attachment style, maternal psychiatric symptoms and postpartum anxiety level were found to be the predictors of PPD. One in every five infants had IC and maternal education level, hostility score and PPD symptoms along with paternal insecure attachment style and psychiatric symptoms were the main predictors of IC. Conclusion: Results about PPD and IC regarding maternal variables are consistent with the literature. In addition, paternal insecure attachment style is found to be an important risk factor for both PPD and IC. Fathers should also be included in further studies exploring PPD or IC.

The male proband was born at term after an unremarkable pregnancy to consanguineous parents of Bangladeshi origin. Shortly after birth, he was hypotonic and stridorous and required intubation. The female proband was born at 36 weeks gestation with hypotonia and respiratory distress. Mechanical ventilation was needed for 8 months followed by continuous positive airway pressure via tracheostomy until 18 months of age. Patient 1 represents the first reported case of CMS and VCP due to synaptic basal lamina defects (COLQ). Collectively, the above cases add novel mutation data to rare causes of CMS and emphasize that VCP and neonatal stridor should raise the suspicion of congenital myasthenic syndrome.

T2  - Biological Psychology
AB  - We investigated main and interactive effects of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity and gestational weight gain on circadian cortisol from the second to third trimester. A diverse sample of 215 pregnant women was enrolled. Maternal height and most recent pre-pregnancy weight were collected at study initiation (22% obese). Weight and circadian salivary cortisol samples were measured during second (24 ± 4) and third (35 ± 1 weeks) trimesters. During the third trimester, women who were obese prior to conception showed elevated evening cortisol versus normal weight women. This pattern was moderated by weight gain in excess of Institute of Medicine guidelines, such that women who were obese prior to conception and gained greater than 7.94kg by the 35 ± 1 week visit displayed greatest elevations in evening cortisol. Given links between excessive prenatal glucocorticoid exposure and both poor maternal and offspring health outcomes, elevated maternal cortisol may be one mechanism underlying links between maternal obesity and adverse perinatal outcomes.

T2  - Maternal and Child Health Journal
AB  - Mother-infant bed-sharing has been associated with a higher risk of sleep-related infant deaths, which affects African Americans at a disproportionately higher rate. Although “separate but proximate sleep surfaces” for infants has been recommended since 2005, bed-sharing remains a common practice, especially among African Americans. This study examined factors associated with bed-sharing among African American and White mothers. Separate logistic regression models were constructed for African American and White respondents to the 2007–2010 Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System. The sample consisted of 806 African Americans and 1,680 Whites (N = 2,486). A significantly larger proportion of African Americans (70.6 %) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.4 %). For both races, partner-related stress was significantly associated with bed-sharing; no significant differences were found between the two racial groups. For African Americans, partner stress (OR 1.8: 1.2–2.6) and maternal education of 13–15 years (OR 2.0: 1.2–3.4) or ≥16 years (OR 2.7: 1.1–6.3) was associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. For Whites, partner stress (OR 1.3: 1–1.8), breastfeeding (OR 2.5: 1.9–3.1), income of $35,000–$49,999 (OR 1.6: 1.2–2.3), being unmarried (OR 1.5: 1.1–2.2), needing money for food (OR 1.6: 1.1–2.3), and non-supine sleep (OR 1.8: 1.2–2.6) were associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. Differences were found in bed-sharing factors between racial groups which suggests a need for culturally-relevant, tailored safe infant sleep interventions. Providers should ask families about their infant’s sleeping environment and address safety issues within that environment. More research is needed on the context and reasons for bed-sharing.

AB  - Few studies have investigated maternal fatigue, particularly fatigue throughout the duration of pregnancy and the postpartum period. The purpose of this study was to explore changes related to maternal fatigue from pregnancy to postpartum and the factors influencing fatigue. This prospective longitudinal study surveyed 197 pregnant women beyond 24 gestational weeks monthly until one month postpartum. The Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale and one question about fatigue were used. Women at late pregnancy experienced a significant increase in level of fatigue, which remained high after childbirth. Those who were not happy about the pregnancy or were multiparas experienced a higher level of prenatal fatigue than their counterparts. At postpartum, mothers who were unemployed, had no one to help with childcare, or felt that the baby's night‐time sleep pattern was a serious problem had a higher level of fatigue. Interventions can be planned and implemented at early pregnancy to reduce the prevalence of fatigue. Encouraging pregnant women to share experiences and thoughts about pregnancy and being a mother is suggested. Further studies that evaluate culturally sensitive instruments for fatigue are needed.

AB  - Lumbopelvic pain is common in pregnancy but the sensitization factors underlying the condition are largely unknown. This study characterized the somatosensory profile of pregnant and nonpregnant women and the relationship between pain, hypersensitivity, and commonly used manual clinical tests. Thirty-nine pregnant and 22 nonpregnant women were included. Although lumbopelvic pain was not an inclusion criterion, the pregnant women were divided into low- and high-pain groups following data collection. The sensitivity to light brush, pin-prick, and pressure pain was assessed bilaterally at 3 sites in the lumbopelvic region, at the shoulder, and in the lower leg. Responses to the active straight leg raise test and pain provocation tests of the sacroiliac joint were recorded. Participants completed questionnaires addressing emotional and physical well-being and rated disability using the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire. Compared with controls, the high-pain group rated the active straight leg raise test as more difficult (P P P P < .05). Perspective: This article presents the somatosensory profile of a healthy pregnant cohort. The results indicate that pain sensitivity increases during pregnancy possibly owing to the physical changes the body undergoes during pregnancy but also owing to changes in emotional health. This should be accounted for in clinical management of pregnant women with lumbopelvic pain. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The timing and pattern of mammalian behavioral activities are regulated by an evolutionary optimized interplay of the genetically based biological (circadian) clock located in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nuclei and direct responses to environmental factors that superimpose and thus mask the clock-mediated effects, the most important of which is the photically induced phase-setting (synchronization) of the circadian rhythmicity to the 24-hour solar day. In wild and captive animals living under the natural conditions prevailing in their habitat, to date, only a few attempts have been made to analyze the role of these two regulatory mechanisms in the species’ adaptation to the time structure prevailing in their habitat. We studied the impact of housing conditions and season on the daily timing and pattern of activity in Mexican spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). To this end, we carried out long-term activity recordings with Actiwatch® AW4 accelerometer/data-logger devices in 11 adult Ateles living under identical natural lighting and climatic conditions in either a large wire netting cage or a 0.25 ha forest enclosure in the primatological field station of Veracruz State University near Catemaco, Mexico. In a gravid female in the forest enclosure, we obtained first-hand information on the effect of late pregnancy and parturition on the monkey’s activity rhythm. The Ateles behaved strictly diurnal and undertook about 90% of daily total activity during this activity time. Due to a higher second activity peak in late afternoon, the bimodal activity pattern was more pronounced in monkeys living in the forest enclosure. Although the spider monkeys kept there had an earlier activity onset and morning activity peak than their conspecifics in the cage, no consistent differences were found in the parameters characterizing the phase-setting of the circadian system to the environmental 24-h periodicity, either by comparison or correlation with the external time markers of sunrise (SR) and sunset (SS). The most obvious effect of late pregnancy, parturition and lactation was a distinct reduction of the activity level during the week of parturition and the next. Seasonal variations in the form of significant differences between the long-day summer half year and the short-day winter half year were established in the phase-angle differences of the morning activity peak to SR, in the evening activity peak and activity offset to SS, as well as in the activity time and the peak-to-peak interval, but not in the phase position of activity onset to SR or in the height of the morning and evening activity peak. These findings in combination with a high variability of the phase angle differences indicate that in A. geoffroyi, a relatively weak circadian component and strong masking direct effects of environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the daily activity rhythm.

AB  - Background: Previous research has established a number of risk factors that are associated with the onset of PTSD following childbirth. However, little is known about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms. Methods: This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum. Results: We found several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point—PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum—only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum. Limitations: Limitations of the study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia from PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Women's Health
AB  - Background: The objective of our study was to determine demographic characteristics, health and sexual behaviors, and psychological health associated with pregnancy ambivalence. We used a cross-sectional design for our study. Methods: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted among nonpregnant women 16-40 years old from southeast Texas from July 2010 to August 2011. The survey included questions pertaining to demographics, pregnancy intentions, health behaviors, sexual behaviors, violence exposure, pregnancy coercion, and psychological behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine differences between ambivalent and nonambivalent females. Results: Of the 1,388 women included in this analysis, 529 (38%) were ambivalent toward pregnancy. Ambivalent women were younger (p = 0.03), had fewer children living at home (p p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that ambivalent women were more likely to smoke (p p = 0.02), have had more sexual partners in the past month (p p = 0.01), not used contraception at last sex (p = 0.01), be a victim of violence (p = 0.01), and have experienced pregnancy coercion (p p = 0.01) and perceived stress (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Women ambivalent toward pregnancy are not only less likely to use contraception but also more likely to have unhealthy behaviors and psychological risk factors. As this combination of characteristics may put a future pregnancy and child at risk, awareness about the possible consequences of pregnancy ambivalence needs to increase among the public and medical community. Providers need to focus efforts on screening for this patient population and preventive education through contraceptive counseling. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Australian Psychologist
AB  - Sleep complaints are common in women, and women are more likely to suffer from insomnia than men. Multiple factors across a woman's lifespan, including hormonal changes, age‐related physiological changes, psychosocial factors, the presence of sleep disorders, and physical and mental health conditions, can contribute to complaints of poor sleep in women. This article reviews the literature on the characteristics of, and contributing factors to, subjectively and objectively measured sleep during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and post‐partum period, as well as the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Evidence from both subjective and objective measurements supports the presence of chronic sleep fragmentation associated with pregnancy, acute sleep deprivation during labour and the immediate post‐partum periods, as well as disrupted sleep during the first few months after childbirth. While there is evidence for menstrual cycle and menopause related sleep disturbance based on women's self report, findings from objectively measured sleep have been mixed. Observational and intervention studies on the relationship between sleep and women's psychological well‐being suggest that underlying causes of sleep disturbance across a woman's lifespan are often multi‐factorial. Comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions are needed in managing sleep problems in women. Cognitive behavioural interventions have been shown to reduce sleep complaints during the perinatal and menopausal periods, and improvements in sleep are likely to lead to improvements in women's overall well‐being.

TI  - Infant sleep issues & parent education programming in Pikeville, Kentucky: A program design.
AU  - Huffman, Catherine Danielle
AB  - The parent education program proposed in this dissertation aimed to provide parents in rural Kentucky with an empirically-supported and culturally-sensitive overview of infant sleep architecture, infant sleep norms, sleep disorders, sleep hygiene, and the impact of untreated sleep disorders. The program was designed for use with expectant parents as well as parents of infants between the ages of zero and six months who are interested in learning current best practices for establishing good sleep habits in their infant children. The program was designed for the prevention of sleep problems as well as to aid in the early identification and timely treatment of existing infant sleep disorders. The planned setting for the use of this manual as a group psychoeducation program will be a pregnancy care center in a rural area of Kentucky. Participants in this program should be parents of children within the zero to six-month age range or expectant parents. Participants are expected to vary in age, racial/ethnic background, and socioeconomic status and may choose to bring along family members. Content was designed to promote best practices while respecting cultural differences. This program was designed to provide sleep-related psychoeducation, self-care information, and resource suggestions for parents before their children develop problems with sleep. The goal was to prevent sleep disordered behaviors from developing or exacerbating in infants and young children, by providing parents with the necessary knowledge to identify and seek treatment for concerning symptoms as early as possible. Manual components represent a comprehensive and practical overview of research findings related to sleep issues. This program was designed to be the first to utilize empirically-supported recommendations focused on empowering Appalachian parents to teach their infants good sleep habits, advising them on ways to provide a healthy and safe sleep environment, and encouraging them to attend to their own self-care (particularly in relation to getting adequate sleep) as means of promoting their infant's general health and wellbeing. The development of a parent manual is a product of this program design, and has been included as a formal appendix. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The spontaneous brain activity exhibits long-range spatial correlations detected using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in newborns when (1) long neuronal pathways are still developing, and (2) the electrical brain activity consists of developmentally unique, intermittent events believed to guide activity-dependent brain wiring. We studied this spontaneous electrical brain activity using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) of premature and fullterm babies during sleep to assess the development of spatial integration during last months of gestation. Correlations of frequency-specific amplitudes were found to follow a robust bimodality: During low amplitudes (low mode), brain activity exhibited very weak spatial correlations. In contrast, the developmentally essential high-amplitude events (high mode) showed strong spatial correlations. There were no clear spatial patterns in the early preterm, but clear frontal and parieto-occipital modules at term age. A significant fronto-occipital gradient was also seen in the development of the graph measure clustering coefficient. Strikingly, no bimodality was found in the fMRI recordings of the fullterm babies, suggesting that early EEG activity and fMRI signal reflect different mechanisms of spatial coordination. The results are compatible with the idea that early developing human brain exhibits intermittent long-range spatial connections that likely provide the endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks.

AB  - There is considerable evidence that a mild, non-injurious insult can protect (precondition) against a subsequent injurious insult. Typically, protection is seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO₂ <17 mm Hg) would reduce neural injury in chronically instrumented lategestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion (normoxia: n = 9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n = 9) or normoxia plus sham ischaemia (sham controls: n = 9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO₂ values (16.1 ± 0.6 vs. 26.0 ± 1.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033 ± 412 vs. 5,261 ± 238 g) compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia. These data suggest that chronic hypoxia is not associated with a significant preconditioning effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Schizophrenia Research
AB  - Objectives: This study investigated whether psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are prevalent amongst women in pregnancy and/or in the early postnatal phase, and whether the predictors identified in the literature for non-puerperal psychosis apply in a general sample of perinatal women. Method: 101 women in their third trimester of pregnancy completed questionnaire measures of mood, subjective well-being, sleep, expectations about labour, and PLEs. 66 of these participants also completed questionnaires shortly after giving birth. The main outcome measures were scores on the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) and the Launay–Slade Hallucination Scale—Revised (LSHS-R). Results: During pregnancy, 80% of the samples endorsed at least one item on the PDI, and 76% endorsed at least one item on the LSHS-R. Endorsement rates were lower postnatally, with rates of 59% and 52% for the PDI and LSHS-R, respectively. Mean scores on the PDI were 3.07 during pregnancy and 1.61 postnatally. Mean scores on the LSHS-R were 8.38 during pregnancy and 5.24 postnatally. Hierarchical multiPLEs regression analyses revealed that ratings of depressive symptomatology significantly predicted PDI total score during pregnancy and LSHS-R total score postnatally, whilst postnatally, scores obtained on the PDI and LSHS-R postnatally were significantly predicted by scores on these measures during pregnancy. Fear in childbirth, but not in pregnancy, showed associations with PLEs but these associations were not maintained once multivariate analyses were conducted. Conclusions: The results of this study support the continuum model of psychosis, by illustrating that PLEs occur frequently in perinatal individuals without a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: Postpartum mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis) are serious conditions that affect approximately 10–15% of women after childbirth, and up to 40% of women at risk for these disorders. Research reveals an association between poor sleep quality/quantity and symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosis. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence for the relationship between sleep and postpartum mental disorders. Methods: Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews—Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost CINAHL through June 30, 2014. Manual searching was performed on reference lists of included articles. Published primary research in any language was included. Results: There were 3187 unique titles/abstracts and 44 full-text articles reviewed. Thirty-one studies were included. Evidence was found for the impact of self-reported poor sleep during pregnancy and the postpartum on the development of postpartum depression, with not enough evidence for either postpartum anxiety or psychosis. The evidence for objectively assessed sleep and the development of postpartum disorders was mixed. Among the 31 studies included, 1 was strong, 13 were moderate and 17 were weak. Limitations: Research design, method of assessment, timing of assessment, recruitment strategies, representative adequacy of the samples and inclusion/exclusion criteria all varied widely. Many studies did not use tools validated for the perinatal population and had small sample sizes without power analysis. Conclusions: Sleep interventions represent a potential low-cost, non-pharmacological prevention and treatment strategy for postpartum mental illness. Further high-quality research is needed on this topic area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Presents a case report of a unique phenotype with in utero onset of movement disorder, with evolving epilepsy, epileptic encephalopathy and developmental delay. The proband was the first child of healthy nonconsanguineous, Caucasian parents born at 40 + 3 weeks gestation by ventouse delivery. Shortly after birth he was noted to have jittery movements and a pathologically exaggerated startle response to tactile and acoustic stimuli, prompting a suspicion of hyperekplexia. At 15 h of age he had an asymmetrical clonic seizure, diagnosed clinically, lasting for around 2 min, and requiring admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. He went on to develop frequent stereotyped tonic/tonic-clonic seizures progressing to epileptic status. Seizures continued despite treatment. The seizure pattern changed from around 3 months, featuring predominantly tonic seizures later on accompanied by apneas requiring multiple pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions. He continued to have an exaggerated startle, paroxysmal posturing and jittery movements subsiding in sleep that on clinical and encephalographic grounds were not epileptic in nature. MRI of the brain at 7 days of age was normal. Repeat neuroimaging including MR spectroscopy at 4 months showed mild cerebellar volume loss with age-appropriate myelination.

AB  - The aims of this longitudinal study were to examine (a) development of infant sleep and maternal sleep from 3 to 6 months postpartum; (b) concomitant and prospective links between maternal sleep and infant sleep; and (c) triadic links between paternal involvement in infant caregiving and maternal and infant sleep. The study included 57 families that were recruited during pregnancy. Maternal and infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries for 5 nights. Both fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. The results demonstrated moderate improvement in infant and maternal sleep percent between 3 and 6 months. Maternal sleep percent at 3 months significantly predicted infant sleep percent at 6 months. Greater paternal involvement in infant daytime and nighttime caregiving at 3 months significantly predicted more consolidated maternal and infant sleep at 6 months. These findings suggest that maternal sleep is an important predictor of infant sleep and that increased involvement of fathers in infant caregiving responsibilities may contribute to improvements in both maternal and infant sleep during the first 6 months postpartum.

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rodent pups are analogous to cries in human babies. There is reduction in USVs in pups after experimental deprivation of rapid eye movement sleep of dams during pregnancy. However, the effects of total sleep deprivation on the USVs of newborns and their emotional development are not documented. Male pups born to the rats that underwent total sleep deprivation for 5h during the third trimester made higher vocalizations, when tested on early postnatal days (pnds) in an isolation-paradigm. Their anxiety-related behaviors during pnds 25–28, were tested using elevated plus maze (EPM). In comparison to the control pups, weanlings of sleep-deprived dams made increased entries into the open arms and higher mobility in the EPM. Enhanced distress calls during early pnds and reduction in risk assessment in weanlings indicate a link between the two behaviors. The USVs during ontogeny may provide early signals about altered emotional development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Matheson, S. L.

T2  - Psychological Medicine
AB  - Background: True findings about schizophrenia remain elusive; many findings are not replicated and conflicting results are common. Well-conducted systematic reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size. In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia. Method: Reviews were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs that may be prone to bias. Results: High- and moderate-quality evidence shows that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections, childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), particularly in certain ethnic groups. Developmental motor delays and lower intelligence quotient in childhood and adolescence are apparent. Conclusions: We conclude that while our knowledge of schizophrenia is very substantial, our understanding of it remains limited. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Identification of key preoptic area nuclei mediating sex differences and estrogenic modulation of sleep in a rodent model.
AU  - Cusmano, Danielle M.
AB  - Women are twice as likely as men to experience sleep disruptions and insomnia throughout their lifespan. The reason for this sex difference in sleep is unknown. In females, findings from clinical and basic research studies strongly implicate a role for gonadal steroids in sleep modulation. Sleep disruptions and complaints in women typically coincide with marked changes in the gonadal steroidal profile during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. Likewise, fluctuations in the ovarian hormonal milieu across the estrous cycle in female rodents correlate with changes in sleep and wakefulness, such that when estradiol levels are elevated sleep is suppressed. In male rodents, sleep remains relatively unchanged following changes in testosterone levels. Here, we sought to address the mechanism by which gonadal steroids selectively suppress sleep in females. Using a rat model, we found that sex differences in sleep resulted from activational effects of estradiol on sexually differentiated brain circuitry. Sexual differentiation of the brain organized the sleep circuitry, specifically the ventrolateral peroptic area (VLPO) and the median preoptic nucleus (MnPN). We found that estrogen receptor alpha expression in the MnPN was higher in females compared to males, making this nucleus an ideal target for estradiol's actions on sleep. In females, antagonism of estrogen receptors within the MnPN attenuated the estradiol-mediated suppression of sleep. Furthermore, direct infusion of estradiol into the MnPN induced wakefulness and suppressed sleep. The orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus are regulated by MnPN activity and orexin is a key neuropeptide involved in arousal and suppression of sleep. We hypothesized that estradiol action in the MnPN would release the inhibitory tone on orexin but antagonism of orexin receptors did not completely block estradiol's suppressive effects on sleep. We also found a sex difference in the sleep-promoting effect of the dual orexin receptor antagonists, such that females experienced prolonged wake suppression compared to males. Together, these data begin to address major gaps in our knowledge regarding sex differences and hormonal modulation of sleep. Advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying hormonal modulation of sleep is imperative for better treatment of sleep disruption in women.

AB  - Sleep deprivation in women resulting from their modern lifestyle, especially during pregnancy, is a serious concern as it can affect the health of the newborn. Anxiety disorders and cognitive deficits in the offspring are also on the rise. However, experimental studies on the effects of sleep loss during pregnancy, on emotional development and cognitive function of the newborn, are scanty in literature. In the current study, female rats were sleep-deprived for 5h by gentle handling, during the 6 days of the third trimester (days 14–19 of pregnancy). The effects of this sleep deprivation on anxiety-related behaviors of pups during their peri-adolescence age were studied using elevated plus maze (EPM). In addition to body weights of dams and offspring, the maternal behavior was also monitored. The weanlings of sleep-deprived dams showed heightened risk-taking behavior as they made increased explorations into the open arms of EPM. They also showed higher mobility in comparison to the control group. Though the body weights of sleep-deprived dams were comparable to those of the control group, their newborns had lower birth weight. Nevertheless, these pups gained weight and reached the control group values during the initial post-natal week. But after weaning, their rate of growth was lower than that of the control group. This is the first report providing evidences for the role of sleep during late pregnancy in shaping the neuropsychological development in offspring.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common complication of childbearing with a 13% prevalence rate. Sleep disturbances are also common, particularly during early postpartum. In theory, l-tryptophan could improve sleep and reduce depressed mood in early postpartum; however, the first step in clinical development of tryptophan for use in postpartum is to measure the effect of oral l-tryptophan on its concentrations in breast milk, which is presently unknown. The aims were to investigate the effect of oral l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin, a protein with high tryptophan concentration, on total and free tryptophan levels in breast milk and plasma, and to compare free tryptophan levels in breast milk with those in common infant formulas. Thirty healthy breastfeeding women were randomly allocated to receive 2g or 4g of l-tryptophan, or, 20g or 40g of alpha-lactalbumin or no supplement. Free tryptophan levels were also measured in 12 different infant formulas. Total tryptophan in breast milk was unaffected by oral administration of l-tryptophan or alpha-lactalbumin (repeated measures of ANOVA (rANOVA), group effect: p = 0.93). Both l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin were associated with greater free tryptophan levels in breast milk (rANOVA, group effect: p l-tryptophan does not affect its total concentration in breast milk. These results support further investigation of dietary l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin as part of a dietary supplementation approach to address sleep disturbances in postpartum and reduce risk of PPD.

AB  - This study investigated the mediating roles of sleep and depression on the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake among low-income overweight and obese pregnant women by trimesters. Participants (N = 213) completed a self-administered survey including stress (exogenous variable), depression, sleep (mediators), fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake (endogenous variables). Path analysis was performed to compare mediation effects among pregnant women in each trimester. Consistently across three trimesters, stress was related to depression but not sleep duration, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency or fat intake. Sleep duration was not associated with depression. Depending on trimester, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, and sleep latency were related to depression; night time sleep disturbance and depression affected fat intake; stress influenced fruit and vegetable intake. Sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency and depression did not mediate the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake in the second and third trimesters. However, depression mediated the relationship between stress and fat intake in the first trimester. Stress management interventions may help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women decrease depressive symptoms and therefore contribute to overall nutritional health.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify factors that influenced stress, healthy eating and physical activity among low-income overweight or obese pregnant women. We conducted seven focus groups with 96 low-income overweight and obese pregnant women. Common themes were identified from audio tapes and transcripts. Women said that poor communication affected their relationships with spouses or significant others. They were frustrated or upset with significant others for three key reasons: failure to understand or listen to the pregnant women’s pregnancy concerns, refusal to be helpful when asked and being overly concerned with the woman’s safety. Most women said that they were emotional and took naps throughout the day after becoming pregnant. Many withdrew from their social interactions. They also faced numerous challenges that made healthy eating more difficult, e.g., craving for unhealthy foods and eating foods for comfort. To eat healthier, some reminded themselves to avoid overeating or stop eating in the car. Women were not physically active because of tiredness, lack of motivation, inadequate social support, or bad weather. Some stayed physically active to prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain and have an easier labor. Women equivocally said weighing themselves to manage weight would add to their stress and make them feel more depressed. When designing interventions to help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women avoid excessive pregnancy weight gain, it is important to include information and practical advice on stress management, emphasizing effective communication skills with significant others and helping them plan effective ways to manage negative feelings.

AB  - Background: New parents have to adjust to less sleep, less free time, and more responsibility as a result of having a child. The purpose of this study was to examine how having a child impacts the physical activity (PA) beliefs and behaviors of new parents over a 2- to 3-year time period. Methods: Participants included 49 men and women (31 % men, 96% white) who did not have a child at baseline (26.3 ± 1.1 years old) but did have a child at the time of follow-up (28.9 ± 1.7 years old). The child's mean age at follow-up was 12 ± 7 months old. PA was measured via questionnaire at baseline and again at follow-up. Interviews regarding PA occurred at follow-up. Results: PA significantly decreased in parents across the time period (P < .001), and parents attributed this decrease to having a child and being pregnant. Parents mentioned they lack time, energy, and motivation for PA as a result of caring for a new child. Parents who maintained their activity level stated they prioritized PA and chose activities they enjoyed. Conclusions: These results show that although activity levels decrease in individuals who have a child, PA in new parents may be a function of priority, intensity, and enjoyment.

AB  - Fetal behavioral states are defined by fetal movement and heart rate variability (HRV). At 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) the distinction of four fetal behavioral states represented by combinations of quiet or active sleep or awakeness is possible. Prior to 32weeks, only periods of fetal activity and quiesence can be distinguished. The increasing synchronization of fetal movement and HRV reflects the development of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) detects fetal heart activity at high temporal resolution, enabling the calculation of HRV parameters. This study combined the criteria of fetal movement with the HRV analysis to complete the criteria for fetal state detection. HRV parameters were calculated including the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal R–R interval (SDNN), the mean square of successive differences of the R–R intervals (RMSSD, SDNN/RMSSD ratio, and permutation entropy (PE) to gain information about the developing influence of the ANS within each fetal state. In this study, 55 magnetocardiograms from healthy fetuses of 24–41 weeks’ GA were recorded for up to 45 min using a fetal biomagnetometer. Fetal states were classified based on HRV and movement detection. HRV parameters were calculated for each state. Before GA 32 weeks, 58.4% quiescence and 41.6% activity cycles were observed. Later, 24% quiet sleep state (1F), 65.4% active sleep state (2F), and 10.6% active awake state (4F) were observed. SDNN increased over gestation. Changes of HRV parameters between the fetal behavioral states, especially between 1F and 4F, were statistically significant. Increasing fetal activity was confirmed by a decrease in PE complexity measures. The fHRV parameters support the differentiation between states and indicate the development of autonomous nervous control of heart rate function.

AB  - Study Objectives: Our investigation aims to assess the impact of symptoms of maternal sleep disordered breathing, specifically sleep apnea risk and daytime sleepiness, on fetal leukocyte telomere length. Participants and Setting: Pregnant women were recruited upon hospital delivery admission. Interventions: Sleep exposure outcomes were measured using the Berlin Questionnaire to quantify sleep apnea and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to measure daytime sleepiness. Participants were classified as “High Risk” or “Low Risk” for sleep apnea based on responses to the Berlin, while “Normal” or “Abnormal” daytime sleepiness was determined based on responses to the Epworth. Design: Neonatal umbilical cord blood samples (N = 67) were collected and genomic DNA was isolated from cord blood l eukocytes using Quantitative PCR. A ratio of relative telomere length was derived by telomere repeat copy number and single copy gene copy number (T/S ratio) and used to compare telomere lengths. Bootstrap and ANOVA statistical procedures were employed. Measurements and Results: On the Berlin, 68.7% of participants were classified as Low Risk while 31.3% were classified as High Risk for sleep apnea. According to the Epworth scale, 80.6% were determined to have Normal daytime sleepiness, and 19.4% were found to have Abnormal daytime sleepiness. The T/S ratio among pregnant women at High Risk for sleep apnea was significantly shorter than for those at Low Risk (P value < 0.05), and the T/S ratio among habitual snorers was significantly shorter than among non-habitual snorers (P value < 0.05). Although those with Normal Sleepiness had a longer T/S ratio than those with Abnormal Sleepiness, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating shortened telomere length among fetuses exposed to maternal symptoms of sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy, and suggest sleep disordered breathing as a possible mechanism of accelerated chromosomal aging.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of physical activity before and during pregnancy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Data from the cluster-randomised gestational diabetes mellitus primary prevention trial conducted in maternity clinics were utilised in a secondary analysis. The cases considered were pregnant women who reported engaging in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity per week (active women) (N = 80), and the controls were women below these recommendations (less active) (N = 258). All participants had at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Their HRQoL was evaluated via the validated generic instrument 15D, with HRQoL at the end of pregnancy examined in relation to changes in physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression models addressed age, parity, education, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. At the end of pregnancy, the expected HRQoL was higher (tobit regression coefficient 0.022, 95 % CI 0.003–0.042) among active women than less active women. Active women also had greater mobility (OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.04–3.78), ability to handle their usual activities (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.29–3.81), and vitality (OR 2.08, 95 % CI 1.22–3.54) than did less active women. Active women reported higher-quality sleep (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.03–4.30) throughout pregnancy as compared to less active women. Meeting of the physical activity guidelines before pregnancy was associated with better overall HRQoL and components thereof related to physical activity.

AB  - Disturbances of fetal autonomic brain development can be evaluated from fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) reflecting the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Although HRP analysis from cardiotocographic (CTG) recordings is established for fetal surveillance, temporal resolution is low. Fetal magnetocardiography (MCG), however, provides stable continuous recordings at a higher temporal resolution combined with a more precise heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. A direct comparison of CTG and MCG based HRV analysis is pending. The aims of the present study are: (i) to compare the fetal maturation age predicting value of the MCG based fetal Autonomic Brain Age Score (fABAS) approach with that of CTG based Dawes-Redman methodology; and (ii) to elaborate fABAS methodology by segmentation according to fetal behavioral states and HRP. We investigated MCG recordings from 418 normal fetuses, aged between 21 and 40 weeks of gestation. In linear regression models we obtained an age predicting value of CTG compatible short term variability (STV) of R² = 0.200 (coefficient of determination) in contrast to MCG/fABAS related multivariate models with R² = 0.648 in 30 min recordings, R² = 0.610 in active sleep segments of 10 min, and R² = 0.626 in quiet sleep segments of 10 min. Additionally segmented analysis under particular exclusion of accelerations (AC) and decelerations (DC) in quiet sleep resulted in a novel multivariate model with R² = 0.706. According to our results, fMCG based fABAS may provide a promising tool for the estimation of fetal autonomic brain age. Beside other traditional and novel HRV indices as possible indicators of developmental disturbances, the establishment of a fABAS score normogram may represent a specific reference. The present results are intended to contribute to further exploration and validation using independent data sets and multicenter research structures.

AB  - Objective: This study sought to characterize sleep patterns and sleep problems in a large sample of women across all months of pregnancy. Methods: A total of 2427 women completed an Internet-based survey that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, vitality scale of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Berlin questionnaire, International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) question set, and a short version of the Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI). Results: Across all months of pregnancy, women experienced poor sleep quality (76%), insufficient nighttime sleep (38%), and significant daytime sleepiness (49%). All women reported frequent nighttime awakenings (100%), and most women took daytime naps (78%). Symptoms of insomnia (57%), sleep-disordered breathing (19%), and restless legs syndrome (24%) were commonly endorsed, with no difference across the month of pregnancy for insomnia, sleep-disorder breathing, daytime sleepiness, or fatigue. In addition, high rates of pregnancy-related symptoms were found to disturb sleep, especially frequent urination (83%) and difficulty finding a comfortable sleep position (79%). Conclusions: Women experience significant sleep disruption, inadequate sleep, and high rates of symptoms of sleep disorder throughout pregnancy. These results suggest that all women should be screened and treated for sleep disturbances throughout pregnancy, especially given the impact of inadequate sleep and sleep disorders on fetal, pregnancy, and postpartum outcomes.

AB  - We analyzed the association of sleep quality and glucose metabolism in women after gestational diabetes (pGDM) and in women after normoglycemic pregnancy (controls). Data during pregnancy and a visit within the first 15 months after delivery were collected from 61 pGDM and 30 controls in a prospective cohort study. This included a medical history, physical examination, questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and 5-point oral glucose tolerance test with insulin measurements to determine indices of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. We used Spearman correlation coefficients and multivariate regression models for analysis.9.3 ± 3.2 months after delivery, pGDM had significantly higher fasting and 2 h glucose levels and lower insulin sensitivity than controls. There was no significant difference in age, BMI and sleep quality as assessed with the PSQI between the two groups. The PSQI score correlated with the ogtt-2 h plasma glucose in pGDM (δ = 0.41; p = 0.0012), but not in controls. This association was confirmed with a multivariate linear regression model with adjustment for age, BMI and months post-delivery. Perceived stress was an independent risk factor (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02–1.23) for impaired sleep. Our findings suggest that post-delivery sleep quality significantly influences glucose tolerance in women after GDM and that impaired sleep is associated with increased stress perception. Measures to improve of sleep quality and reduce perceived stress should therefore be tested as additional strategies to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes after GDM.

AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) interventions designed to prevent prenatal complications have focused on increasing moderate PA yielding conflicting results. Minimal attention has focused on the evaluation of sleep, sedentary behavior (SB), light activity or total daily PA during pregnancy. The purpose of this prospective, longitudinal study was to 1) objectively quantify and compare habitual PA and SB during the 2nd and 3rd trimester; and 2) evaluate differences in activity patterns for women meeting prenatal PA guidelines versus those that did not. Methods: Forty-six participants wore 2 PA monitors (SenseWear® Mini and activPAL™) during week 18 and week 35 of pregnancy. We compared differences in sleep duration, postural allocation, daily steps, and PA between the 2nd and 3rd trimester and for women who met and did not meet PA guidelines. Results: During the 2nd trimester, 30% of the women’s day (24-hours) was total sleep; 52% SB; 13% light; 3% moderate; and 0% vigorous PA. Light (P = 0.05), vigorous (P = 0.02), and moderate-vigorous PA (MET-minutes; P = 0.02), decreased with a trend in increased SB (P = 0.07). Activity of other intensities and sleep duration did not significantly change. Only 39% and 37% of participants slept between 7–9 hours/night at week 18 and 35, respectively. Forty-six percent (n = 21) and 28% (n = 13) of participants met prenatal PA guidelines during the 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively. At week 18, no differences in total sleep, SB, or light PA existed for women who met PA guidelines versus those who did not; total PA was significantly greater for women who met guidelines. At week 35, women that met PA guidelines had significantly less SB (P < 0.005) than women who did not. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that pregnant women spend the majority of their day in SB. Significant reductions in total activity across pregnancy may be attributed, in part to shifts in light PA and increased SB. Based on the lifestyle of our sample, regardless of meeting PA guidelines in mid-pregnancy, no significant difference exists in time spent in SB, however meeting PA recommendations in late pregnancy may reduce SB. Future interventions should target reducing SB by increasing light and moderate PA beyond volitional exercise. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Helping kids in crisis: Managing psychiatric emergencies in children and adolescents.
AB  - Each year, more than six million children experience physical or sexual abuse or neglect, and close to two thousand children die from this abuse (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2010). One in four children will experience a major trauma before they turn 16—either child abuse or physical or sexual assault; domestic violence; witnessed violence in his or her community; severe bullying; a terrifying accident or sudden loss; a natural disaster; or an act of terrorism. The effects of such traumatic experiences on a child can be profound. Many children who have experienced trauma will go on to suffer from depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and problems with attention and behavior. They can be at increased risk for risk-taking behaviors, drug and alcohol use, teen pregnancy, dropping out of school, and criminal behaviors. With the right support and treatment, however, traumatized children and adolescents can find a way to understand what has happened to them and put it behind them, to lead healthy and happy lives. Teachers, school mental health providers, and pediatricians can play a critical role in helping to ensure safety for these children and get them the help they need.

AB  - Women have a significantly higher risk for developing mood disorders with a lifetime prevalence that is approximately twice that of men. Sex difference in the rates of depression begins to appear in adolescence. Although reasons for this gender difference are not fully understood, the changing level in reproductive hormones throughout a woman's life may be playing a direct or indirect effect on her mood. Studies on bipolar disorder suggest that women are more likely than men to be rapid cyclers, which is attributed to the increased occurrence of hypothyroidism and menstrual cycle irregularities in women. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are considered to be vulnerable times in a woman's life with significant increase and drop in reproductive hormones and increased risk of psychiatric symptoms. Oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and menopause dampen the cyclicily of ovarian function and can cause mood symptoms. Reproductive hormones modulate neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, and circadian rhythms, all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorder. Changes or variability in reproductive hormones rather than absolute level increases the risk for symptoms in vulnerable individuals. Depression occurring in association with the reproductive cycle may sensitize a woman lo future depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Identifying perinatal depression and anxiety: Evidence-based practice in screening, psychosocial assessment, and management.
AB  - The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is the most widely used method to screen for perinatal depression. A number of other instruments have also been used; these include generic and perinatal-specific self-report questionnaires. Alternative methods include the use of clinician-rated scales and case-finding questions. Choosing the best screening instrument depends on the context in which it is being used. It is important to consider who is going to be administering the instrument and interpreting the results and what action is planned in the event of a positive screen. Self-report scales which include somatic items such as disturbance in sleep and appetite are likely to lead to high false-positive rates in pregnancy and postnatally, so those instruments which exclude somatic questions are preferable at this time. As screening for depression during pregnancy is becoming more commonplace in routine practice, the length of the screen in terms of time taken to use and number of items is important. The first assessment with midwives can be lengthy, and so the shortest depression screens are more likely to be favored in practice. This chapter describes the EPDS and a number of alternative self-report questionnaires and clinician-rated measures that have been used in the perinatal period and then discusses the use of a brief case-finding instrument to identify perinatal depression.

AU  - Kriebs, Jan M.
T2  - The Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing
AB  - The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among women of childbearing age, not only in the United States but also across the globe, contribute to increased risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Overweight and obesity are quantified by body mass index (BMI) for clinical purposes. In 2010, 31.9% of US women aged 20 to 39 years met the definition of obesity, a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater. Across the life span, obesity is associated with increased risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and other diseases. During pregnancy, increasing levels of prepregnancy BMI are associated with increases in both maternal and fetal/neonatal risks. This article reviews current knowledge about obesity in pregnancy and health risks related to increased maternal BMI, addresses weight stigma as a barrier to care and interventions that have evidence of benefit, and discusses the development of policies and guidelines to improve care.

T2  - Neurology
AB  - This article provides an overview of restless legs syndrome (RLS) or Willis-Ekbom disease (WKD). The cause of RLS/WED is unknown. RLS/WED may be either primary or secondary. In primary RLS/WED, symptoms are not associated with other medical conditions. Genetic factors are likely since family history is seen in half of patients. In secondary RLS/WED, the condition is related to other diseases. It may be associated with kidney failure, pregnancy, or peripheral neuropathy. RLS/WED has also been linked to low brain and body iron levels. RLS/WED symptoms include an uncomfortable urge to move the legs in the evening or when at rest during the daytime. Studies have shown that regular moderate exercise may reduce RLS/WED symptoms. Taking warm (or cool) baths or showers, massage, moderate regular exercise, reduced caffeine, and mentally engaging activities can help relieve mild or intermittent RLS/ WED symptoms. However, when symptoms are more severe and regularly disturb sleep or daytime activities, particularly more than 2–3 days per week, RLS/WED treatment may be prescribed. “Augmentation” is an overall worsening of RLS/ WED, with symptoms becoming more intense, occurring earlier in the day, and spreading up to the arms and upper body.

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Objective: Maternal supine posture in late pregnancy and labor is known to compromise maternal hemodynamics and subsequently affect the fetus. Recently, maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home sleep studies. Results: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age 28.3 ± 6.9 weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0–82.9%). Conclusion: Our data suggest that if supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education regarding sleep position. Practice implications: Most pregnant women spend time asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: The majority of women develop sleep impairments during pregnancy, but alterations in dream experiences remain poorly understood. This study aimed to assess prospectively and comparatively the recall of dreaming and of disturbed dreaming in late pregnancy. Methods: Fifty-seven nulliparous, third-trimester pregnant women (mean age ± SD, 28.7 ± 4.06 years) and 59 non-pregnant controls (mean age ± SD, 26.8 ± 4.21 years) completed demographics and psychological questionnaires. A 14-day prospective home log assessed sleep and dream characteristics and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire measured retrospective dream and disturbed dream recall. Results: Even though pregnant and non-pregnant women showed similar prospective dream recall (P = 0.47), pregnant women reported prospectively more bad dreams (P = 0.004). More pregnant women (21%) than non-pregnant women (7%) reported a nightmare incidence exceeding moderately severe pathology (> 1/week) (P = 0.03). Pregnant women also reported overall lower sleep quality (P = 0.007) and more night awakenings (P = 0.003). Higher prospective recall of bad dreams (r = −0.40, P = 0.002) and nightmares (r = −0.32, P = 0.001) both correlated with lower sleep quality in pregnant women. Conclusions: Late pregnancy is a period of markedly increased dysphoric dream imagery that may be a major contributor to impaired sleep at this time. Further polysomnographic assessments of pregnant women are needed to clarify relationships between sleep and disturbed dream production in this population.

TI  - Sex differences in responses to chronic prenatal nicotine exposure in rats.
AU  - Hoegberg, Bethany Grace
AB  - Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease in developed countries. Despite the known risk, currently 19% of the adult population in the United States smoke cigarettes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). Early exposure to nicotine during development is associated with an increased risk of nicotine addiction in adults. Early exposure includes both initiation of smoking during adolescence and prenatal nicotine exposure. Adolescence is the most common period for the initiation of recreational drug use, and 88% of current adult smokers used their first cigarette before the age of 18 (Public Health Service 1994). Evidence also indicates differences between males and females in addiction rates and smoking behavior. Tobacco is also the most commonly abused substance during pregnancy: tobacco use occurs in an estimated 14% of pregnancies in the United States. Infants exposed to tobacco smoke in utero are more likely to be addicted to nicotine. In addition, females exposed to tobacco smoke through the mother appear to progress from initiation of tobacco smoking to addiction more quickly than non-exposed females. All of the pharmacological effects of nicotine are mediated by neuronal nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors (nAChRs), which are widespread throughout the autonomic and central nervous system. In the CNS, nAChRs are primarily presynaptic, and are involved in modulating the release of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine . The involvement of these receptors in the release of neurotransmitters suggests that nicotine use may have widespread effects on important neural pathways in the CNS. In order to help elucidate the underlying causes of sex differences in response to nicotine, we investigated nicotinic receptor regulation and genome expression differences in male and female rats following adolescent and prenatal nicotine exposure. To do this we exposed rats to nicotine under various treatment paradigms using subcutaneously implanted miniosmotic pumps containing either nicotine or saline. Using [3H]epibatidine to label assembled receptors and subunit specific antibodies to characterize receptors, we found sex differences in α4β2* receptor regulation in the cerebral cortex at both early (PN28) and late (PN42) adolescence. These results imply sex differences in sensitivity to nicotine exposure in early and late adolescence. In addition, we found sex differences in α4β2α5 receptor regulation in the cerebral cortex following chronic prenatal nicotine exposure in rats at PN14. After using a fostering paradigm to isolate nicotine exposure to either  in utero only or postnatal only exposure, we determined the sensitivity seen at PN14 in males required a combination of both in utero and postnatal exposure to manifest. Finally, in order to help clarify the underlying basis of behavioral differences in adolescents exposed to nicotine prenatally, we identified persistent alterations in genome expression in dopaminergic cell bodies using microarray analysis of the VTA of adolescent male and female rats following chronic prenatal nicotine exposure. With this method we identified dramatic differences in gene expression between males and females. These changes suggest that disruptions in circadian rhythm regulation may contribute to an increased risk of nicotine addiction in adolescent male rats, but not female rats, exposed to nicotine prenatally. Alterations in these associated genes were confirmed using qRT-PCR. These data suggest both differences in receptor regulation and genomic expression between males and females at ages of increased vulnerability to nicotine.

AB  - Purposes: To analyze which Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Postpartum Depression Screening Scores (PDSS) total and dimensional scores, as well as symptomatic answers proportions significantly differ between women in the perinatal period (pregnant/postpartum) without major depression, with major depression and women outside the perinatal period. Methods: 572 pregnant women in the third trimester completed Beck Depression Inventory-II and Postpartum Depression Screening Scale and were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. 417 of these were also assessed (with the same instruments) at three months postpartum. Ninety non-pregnant women or that did not have a child in the last year (mean age = 29.42 ± 7.159 years) also filled in the questionnaires. Results: Non-depressed pregnant women showed lower scores than depressed pregnant women and higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the BDI-II total score and in its Somatic-Anxiety dimension. Non-depressed postpartum women showed significantly higher scores than women outside the perinatal period only at Sleep/Eating Disturbances. Compared to women outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without depression presented higher scores only in the somatic items. Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and sleep changes. Limitations: Women outside the perinatal period were not diagnosed for the presence of a depressive disorder, but their BDI-II mean score was similar to the figures reported worldwide regarding women in childbearing age. Conclusion: In the perinatal period, most particularly at pregnancy, women experience significant somatic changes even if not clinically depressed. Cognitive-affective symptoms are more useful when assessing the presence of perinatal depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to measure the brain activity of preterm infants treated with caffeine citrate and doxapram for preterm apnoea, using amplitude‐integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), to identify any adverse effects on cerebral function. Methods: We analysed the aEEG tracings of 13 preterm infants < 30 weeks of gestation before, during and after doxapram treatment, with regard to background activity (percentages of continuous and discontinuous patterns), occurrence of sleep‐wake cycling and appearance of electrographic seizure activity. They were also compared with 61 controls without doxapram treatment. Results: During doxapram treatment, aEEG tracings showed an increase in continuous background activity (19 ± 30% before treatment, 38 ± 35% during treatment) and a decrease in discontinuous patterns. In addition, they showed more frequent electrographic seizure activity (0% before treatment, 15 ± 37% during treatment) and less frequent sleep‐wake cycling (92 ± 27% before treatment, 85 ± 37% during treatment) could be observed. These results were confirmed when compared to the control group. Conclusion: Doxapram treatment influences aEEG in preterm infants, showing higher percentages of continuous activity as well as more electrographic seizure activity and less sleep‐wake cycling. It should, therefore, be used with caution in very preterm infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Case: Thomas is a 5-year 6-month-old boy whose parents requested an urgent care appointment because he has recently been suspended from kindergarten stating “and his doctor must see him before he can come back.” His suspension from kindergarten was due to kicking and biting his classmates, but he has also become increasingly aggressive at home. His teacher reported that he has always had a high activity level and difficulty shifting attention between tasks, as well as noncompliance with rules and directions. He is noted to have learning challenges and is showing difficulties in the concept of numbers and letter sounds. The practice has followed Thomas since his healthy birth. He has a history of delayed language development, and he received early intervention services from 2 years of age. He spoke his first word at 2 years 6 months. He started a half-day preschool program at 3 years of age. He had difficulty acclimating to preschool, interacting with peers, and was described as “hyperactive” by his teachers. His program was modified to decrease his time having to sit in a circle time, and he often required the support of the paraprofessional in the classroom. His parents have always described him as a “difficult child.” He gets frustrated easily and can tantrum for up to 2 hours multiple times in a week when his immediate needs or requests are not met. He has difficulty falling asleep, has frequent night awakenings, and often has trouble getting back to sleep. His self-help skills are poor, and he has difficulty with activities such as brushing his teeth and dressing. His parents report that he does not seem to remember rules from day to day. He was evaluated at 5 years of age and diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but his response to stimulants has been limited. Thomas is an only child. His parents are college educated and professionally employed. They deny drug use, domestic violence, and guns in the home. They reported that prior to the pregnancy, they enjoyed “partying” with friends on the weekends, but Thomas’s mother reported that she stopped drinking as soon as she realized she was pregnant. All are wondering whether this child might have a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, although he seems to have no clear facial dysmorphology. It is unsure what the next step might be and if there is value added in pursuing this diagnosis. What do you do next? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Sleep deprivation and disease: Effects on the body, brain and behavior.
AB  - Pregnancy is anecdotally equated with sleep disturbance, most commonly resulting in sleep deprivation, with the possible exception of the first trimester when hypersomnia is frequently reported. The relationship between gestational stage and maternal sleep is likely bidirectional. For example, the dynamic hormonal and physiological changes of pregnancy are known to impact a large variety of sleep parameters, including homeostatic sleep drive, sleep latency, sleep maintenance, duration of sleep, sleep fragmentation, perceived sleep quality, and objectively measured sleep stage cycling. Conversely, sleep disturbance of any kind, including decreased total sleep amount or increased fragmentation, with or without respiratory disturbance, negatively impacts pregnancy outcomes, including gestational hypertensive disease, labor type and duration, prematurity, and birth weight. Thus, while the relationship is undoubtedly complicated, pregnancy provides a natural "experiment" informing the role of reproductive hormones on sleep characteristics, while the interplay of sleep disturbance and pregnancy outcomes alerts to the physiological significance of sleep and its electrophysiological and subjective characteristics. In this chapter, we will review the various aspects of sleep disturbance that may lead to sleep deprivation during pregnancy and the existing evidence that sleep deprivation and disturbance affect pregnancy outcomes.

T2  - Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics
AB  - Objective: Evidence for the adverse effects of prepregnancy obesity on offspring’s neurodevelopmental outcomes has begun to emerge. The authors examined the association between prepregnancy obesity and children’s behavioral problems and if the association would differ by race. Methods: This observational study used a total of 3395 white (n = 2127) and African-American (n = 1268) children aged 96 to 119 months from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Behavior Problem Index (BPI) total and subscale scores were used to measure children’s behavioral problems. The association between maternal prepregnancy obesity and the BPI scores for each racial group was examined using multivariate linear and logistic regressions, controlling for prenatal, child, maternal, and family background factors. Results: Maternal prepregnancy obesity was independently associated with an increase in the BPI total scores among the white sample only. Among the African-Americans, prepregnancy obesity was not associated with the BPI scores. Subsample analyses using externalizing and internalizing subscales also revealed similar trends. Among the white sample, children born to obese women were more socially disadvantaged than those born to nonobese women, whereas no such trend was observed in children of African-American obese and nonobese women. Conclusion: The impact of maternal prepregnancy obesity on children’s behavioral problems differed by racial groups. Obesity-related metabolic dysregulations during the intrauterine period may not contribute to later children’s behavioral problems. Social and psychological factors seem to play key roles in the association between prepregnancy obesity and childhood behavioral problems among whites.

T2  - The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry
AB  - Objective: The authors reviewed the published literature on the acute and long-term neurobehavioral effects on infants and children of either in utero exposure to maternal depression or in utero exposure to antidepressants. Data Sources: The PubMed electronic database was searched to locate 292 English-language studies from the first available year to October 2013 using the keywords pregnancy, antidepressants, depression, perinatal, and neurobehavioral. Study Selection: The authors reviewed only prospective studies that assessed the impact of maternal depression during pregnancy or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on (1) clearly defined short-term behavioral outcomes in infants (perinatal outcome) or (2) longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children (neurodevelopmental outcome). Data Extraction: Studies were included if they were prospective and assessed the impact of maternal depression or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on clearly measurable, objective short-term and longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children. Results: Untreated depression during pregnancy is associated with short-term neonatal effects, including increased distress after delivery, less than optimal orientation and motor activity, and disrupted sleep. Longer-term effects on neurobehavioral outcome have also been reported, including disruptive social behavior, depression, and changes in the period of sensitivity for language discrimination. Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse short-term perinatal symptomatology, including effects on autonomic and motor activity, habituation, and sleep. Longer-term studies of neurobehavioral outcomes of in utero antidepressant exposure suggest potential effects on gross motor function and language development but not cognition. Conclusions: In utero exposure to either maternal depression or antidepressants carries risks to the developing fetus. Treatment decisions regarding whether and how to treat depression during pregnancy must be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the impact of these decisions on both mother and infant.

AB  - Objective: To assess how change in sleep duration is related to subsequent obesity. Methods: In this 10-year follow-up, 4903 non-pregnant participants answered a questionnaire on sleeping habits, obesity, and lifestyle factors (questions identical to baseline questionnaire). Habitual normal sleepers were defined as sleeping 6–9 h/night at both baseline and follow-up, whereas women sleeping PP = 0.01) and central obesity (short: 60.5%, P = 0.01; long: 82.4%, P = 0.01) compared with habitual normal sleepers (general obesity: 8.9%; central obesity: 35.9%) at follow-up. Younger women who were short sleepers at baseline but normal sleepers at the follow-up had a higher prevalence of both general (19.3%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (45.4%, P = 0.07) compared with habitual normal sleepers at follow-up. In adjusted analyses, both habitual short [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 6.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.71–17.0] and long (aOR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.09–19.8) sleep durations were risk factors for general obesity in younger women. In younger women habitual long sleep duration was a risk factor also for central obesity (aOR, 6.05; 95% CI, 1.19–30.7) whereas habitual short sleep duration was not (aOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.87–4.81). Similar results were seen also for weight gain and increased waist circumference as dependent variables. In addition, decreased sleep duration from normal to short duration was a risk factor for both weight gain (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.14–3.02) and increased waist circumference (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.20–2.81). There were no associations between changes in sleep duration and any of the measures of obesity at the follow-up in women aged > 40 years at baseline. Conclusion: In younger women, both habitual short and long sleep duration was a risk factor for obesity, whereas no such relationship was seen in older women.

TI  - A multi-method investigation of infant behavioral states and weight status.
AU  - Frasca, Stephanie Anzman
AB  - Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions; one way to address this problem before obesogenic behaviors and obese phenotypes emerge is to intervene in infancy. The goal of this dissertation was to examine infant behavioral states associated with subsequent obesity risk. Multiple methods were used to study these behaviors in three empirical studies, all in the context of a pilot childhood obesity intervention, with a final sample of 110 well-educated, predominantly White, primiparous mother-infant dyads intending to breastfeed at infant birth. The goal of the first empirical study (Chapter 2) was to describe changes over time in and relationships among infant behavioral states and to test a model where effects of a "Soothe/Sleep" intervention on weight are explained by increases in total daily sleep duration and decreases in feeding time. Overall, total sleep, nighttime awake/calm time, total and nighttime fussing/crying, and total and nighttime feeding time decreased, and nighttime sleep and total awake/calm time increased over the first four months of infancy. Cross-sectional analysis of relationships between behavioral states at each time point revealed that sleeping and feeding were negatively related at 3 weeks, and these inverse relations strengthened over time for the nighttime period but not over 24-hour periods. The hypothesis that increases in total daily sleep and decreases in feeding time contributed to Soothe/Sleep intervention effects on weight status was supported in breastfeeding dyads but not in formula-feeding dyads. The second study (Chapter 3) examined infants' behavioral transitions using Markov models, demonstrating fewer transitions out of sleep at 16 weeks compared to 3 weeks, as well as substantial individual differences in the likelihood of transitioning out of a fussing/crying state at both time points. Transitions out of fussing/crying were malleable and predictive of weight outcomes: the likelihood of transitioning from fussing/crying to feeding was positively associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and with subsequent infant weight status. Additionally, the pilot intervention focused on infant soothing and sleeping increased the likelihood of transitioning from fussing/crying to awake/calm at 16 weeks. There was evidence that transitions out of fussing had different implications depending on the average duration of a fussing episode preceding a transition to feeding. In the third study (Chapter 5), infant temperament was explored as an outcome, a predictor, and a moderator, and results highlighted the importance of a comprehensive investigation of the role of temperament in behavioral intervention studies. The Soothe/Sleep intervention increased mothers' reports of infant negativity; infants in the intervention group also had higher observed infant self-regulation at 1 year. Infants with greater observed negativity at 1 year whose mothers were low on initial parenting self-efficacy demonstrated the greatest weight gain from 1 to 3 years, suggesting that promoting early maternal self-efficacy could be protective against increased obesity risk in highly negative infants. Infant regulation was inversely associated with weight status but was not related to weight gain over time. Initial infant negativity moderated the effects of the Soothe/Sleep intervention on some, but not all, outcomes. Negative infants who participated in the Soothe/Sleep intervention showed the least weight gain from birth to age 3, and their mothers showed improved parenting satisfaction. These studies confirm that early infancy is a promising time to intervene on a behavioral level to promote healthy behaviors and decreased obesity risk, and results elucidated some of the mechanisms through which a pilot intervention focused on infant soothing and sleeping had its effects, including increased sleep duration, decreased feeding time, and increased transitions from a fuss… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - ‘Knowledge is power’: Risk and the moral responsibilities of the expectant mother at the turn of the twentieth century.
AU  - Hallgrimsdottir, Helga Kristin

T2  - Health, Risk & Society
AB  - The notion that ‘older’ mothers experience elevated risks during pregnancy and childbirth has proliferated since the mid-twentieth century. In this article, we take the contemporary concern with age as a starting point from which to historicise and contextualise the concept of maternity risk. To this end, we examine maternal hygiene manuals (self-help guidebooks on motherhood and pregnancy) published between 1880 and 1920 in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis of these manuals indicated that pregnancy during this period was presented as a potentially dangerous affair that required constant surveillance by the self (and others) to ensure favourable pregnancy outcomes. A dominant theme that emerged from the manuals was that the expectant mother was morally responsible for mitigating a range of risk factors, including adequate exercise, sleep, fresh air, as well as for choosing an appropriate father and ensuring his health. At the same time, the manuals indicated that the failure to seek out expert advice and take up responsible practices was linked to adverse consequences for the expectant mother’s health, and her newborn’s health and moral character later in life. We conclude this article by discussing how findings from our historical data can provide an important context for understanding risk discourses around pregnancy as historically specific and culturally contingent, especially with respect to risks associated with maternal advanced age.

AB  - The effects of rapid eye movement sleep restriction (REMSR) in rats during late pregnancy were studied on the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) made by the pups. USVs are distress calls inaudible to human ears. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was restricted in one group of pregnant rats for 22 hours, starting from gestational day 14 to 20, using standard single platform method. The USVs of male pups were recorded after a brief isolation from their mother for two minutes on alternate post-natal days, from day one till weaning. The USVs were recorded using microphones and were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using SASPro software. Control pups produced maximum vocalization on post-natal days 9 to 11. In comparison, the pups born to REMSR mothers showed not only a reduction in vocalization but also a delay in peak call making days. The experimental group showed variations in the types and characteristics of call types, and alteration in temporal profile. The blunting of distress call making response in these pups indicates that maternal sleep plays a role in regulating the neural development involved in vocalizations and possibly in shaping the emotional behaviour in neonates. It is suggested that the reduced ultrasonic vocalizations can be utilized as a reliable early marker for affective state in rat pups. Such impaired vocalization responses could provide an important lead in understanding mother-child bonding for an optimal cognitive development during post-partum life. This is the first report showing a potential link between maternal REM sleep deprivation and the vocalization in neonates and infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Our primary purpose was to assess the impact of objectively measured nighttime sleep duration on gestational glucose tolerance. We additionally examined associations of objectively measured daytime sleep duration and nap frequency on maternal glycemic control. Methods: Sixty-three urban, low-income, pregnant women wore wrist actigraphs for an average of 6 full days in mid-pregnancy prior to screening for hyperglycemia using the 1-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with 1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia, defined as 1-h OGTT values ⩾130mg/dL. Results: Mean nighttime sleep duration was 6.9 ± 0.9h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r = −0.28, P = .03). Shorter nighttime sleep was associated with hyperglycemia, even after controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.1–0.8]). There were no associations of daytime sleep duration and nap frequency with 1-h OGTT values or hyperglycemia. Conclusions: Using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we found that women with shorter nighttime sleep durations had an increased risk for gestational hyperglycemia. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our negative daytime sleep findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Fatigue is among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Estimating fatigue severity with a psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for understanding women’s fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: The study was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within three months postpartum. Results: The C-LFS-SF showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ≥ .97) and stability over the 7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient > .87). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 88–94% of the total variance was explained by the one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct validity. Conclusions: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk pregnancies or with medical conditions.

T2  - Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology
AB  - Objective: This study examined prospectively whether maternal orientation (Facilitator/Regulator) in pregnancy predicted maternal orientation and mothering practices at six months postpartum. Background: A woman’s preferred approach to infant care, present prior to the birth, has been proposed to explain individual differences in mothering behaviour. Method: At 30 weeks gestation, 192 women completed two questionnaire measures assessing maternal orientation. At six months postpartum, maternal orientation and maternal caretaking behaviours were assessed by interview and questionnaire. Results: Bivariate analyses indicated small but significant correlations among measures of antenatal and postnatal maternal orientation. In addition, as predicted, lower Regulator scores in pregnancy were associated with greater likelihood of breastfeeding exclusively, less scheduling of infant feeds and sleeps, and less likelihood of leaving baby to cry to sleep. Associations were found between mother–infant night-time proximity and postnatal (but not antenatal) maternal orientation. Conclusions: Findings offer modest support for the stability and construct validity of maternal orientation assessed in pregnancy and reveal antenatal attitudinal factors that influence maternal caregiving trajectories.

TI  - The effect of an educational intervention in women with gestational diabetes: A pilot study.
AU  - Amason, Janeen S.
AB  - Women with gestational diabetes (GD) are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (DM) after delivery compared to those without GD. Numerous studies in the general population have identified that adoption of healthy lifestyles can prevent DM; however limited research has focused on women with GD. The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of an educational intervention of SUGAR (S&barbelow;tart U&barbelow;nderstanding G&barbelow;estational Diabetes a&barbelow;nd R&barbelow;isk of Type 2 Diabetes), on women's perceived risk of developing DM, knowledge of DM, self-efficacy to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors after childbirth among women with GD. A total of 23 women (mean age of 29.7±3.9), 18 in SUGAR group and 5 in control group (CG) completed self-reported standardized questionnaires (Risk Perception Survey for Developing Diabetes adapted for women with GD; Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices; Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile II; General Sleep Disturbance Scale; and Demographic Questionnaire) at baseline (third trimester) and post-test (postpartum 6- 8 weeks). Intervention was given post the baseline data collection with a booster session at 2-4 weeks postpartum. The women in CG received attention control treatment. Study participants were obese (BMI M-33.1, SD-7.7) and a majority had a family history of DM. Findings showed that self-efficacy was the single significant predictor and accounted for 22% of the variance of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Participants had a clinical significant sleep disturbance during both pregnancy and postpartum. At baseline, poor sleepers reported a lower self-efficacy. The intervention significantly increased DM knowledge for women in the SUGAR group; however, not for perceived risk, self-efficacy nor healthy lifestyle behaviors. There was no difference between groups for postpartum glucose screening rates with only 39% receiving recommended testing. Future research needs to focus on prevention programs and center on self-efficacy, postpartum glucose screening, improve sleep, and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. To ensure a better preventive care for GD women, education provided for both patients and health care provider is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Bipolar Disorders
AB  - Background: In contrast to postpartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder, little is known about the risk of recurrence in men with bipolar disorder who have just become fathers. Case report: We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder who had a manic episode immediately after becoming a father. His spouse had a normal pregnancy, and delivery started during daytime and lasted until the early morning hours. The patient subsequently developed a manic episode, which had a major impact on the family. Conclusions: There is a well‐known relationship between sleep loss and the occurrence of a manic episode. The study of psychopathology in the postpartum period in relation to sleep disturbance refers mainly to women. Disturbance of sleep patterns in the perinatal and postpartum period may also negatively impact the course of bipolar disorder in the father. In cases of pregnancy of a male bipolar disorder patient's spouse, preventive strategies for the postpartum period should be planned in advance.

T2  - PLoS ONE
AB  - Background: Insomnia and depression are strongly interrelated. This study aimed to describe changes in sleep across childbirth, and to evaluate whether insomnia in pregnancy is a predictor of postpartum depression. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Women received questionnaires in weeks 17 and 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. This paper presents data from 2,088 of 4,662 women with complete data for insomnia and depression in week 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. Sleep times, wake-up times and average sleep durations were self-reported. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Results: After delivery, sleep duration was reduced by 49 minutes (to 6.5 hours), and mean sleep efficiency was reduced from 84% to 75%. However, self-reported insomnia scores (BIS) improved from 17.2 to 15.4, and the reported prevalence of insomnia decreased from 61.6% to 53.8%. High EPDS scores and anxiety in pregnancy, fear of delivery, previous depression, primiparity, and higher educational level were risk factors for both postpartum insomnia and depression. Insomnia did not predict postpartum depression in women with no prior history of depression, whereas women who recovered from depression had residual insomnia. Limitations: Depression and insomnia were not verified by clinical interviews. Women with depressive symptoms were less likely to remain in the study. Conclusions: Although women slept fewer hours at night after delivery compared to during late pregnancy, and reported more nights with nighttime awakenings, their self-reported insomnia scores improved, and the prevalence of insomnia according to the DSM-IV criteria decreased. Insomnia in pregnancy may be a marker for postpartum recurrence of depression among women with previous depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To identify quantitative MEG indices of spontaneous brain activity for fetal neurological maturation in normal pregnancies and examine the effect of fetal state on these indices. Methods: Spontaneous MEG brain activity was examined in 22 low-risk fetal recordings with gestational age (GA) ranging from 30 to 37 weeks. As major quantitative characteristics of spontaneous activity, burst duration (BD) and interburst interval (IBI) were studied in correlation with GA and fetal state. Results: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age (−0.21 s/week, P = 0.0031). This trend was only maintained in the quiet-sleep state. With respect to BD, no significant trends were detected with GA and state. Conclusion: IBI can be quantified as a fetal brain maturational parameter. The decrease in IBI over gestation was similar to the trend reported in the preterm neonatal EEG studies. Quiet sleep could be the optimal state to study such MEG maturational indices. Significance: With further investigation, indices extracted from spontaneous fetal brain activity may serve as an early warning for fetal neurological distress.

T2  - Hormones and Behavior
AB  - The impact of pregnancy and lactation on ultradian rhythms (URs) and circadian rhythms (CRs) of locomotor activity was assessed in circadian rhythmic and arrhythmic Siberian hamsters maintained in a long-day photoperiod (16 h light/day). Progressive decrements in CR robustness and amplitude over the course of gestation were accompanied by enhanced URs. Dark-phase UR period and amplitude increased during early gestation and complexity and robustness increased during late gestation. The persistence of pregnancy-associated enhancements of URs in circadian arrhythmic (ARR) hamsters suggests that reproductive modulation of the UR waveform is not dependent on coherent circadian organization. The increased incidence of dark-phase URs appeared more rapidly in ARR dams than entrained (ENTR) dams. Throughout gestation, the percentage of dams with dark-phase URs was significantly greater in the ARR group. Gestational increases in UR complexity and robustness emerged earlier and were greater in ARR than ENTR dams. The attenuation of CRs during lactation is correlated with increased expression of URs. Relaxation of circadian control of the dam's behavior may increase fitness by permitting more efficient interactions with circadian arrhythmic pups.

AB  - Objective: Although many studies have shown the evolution of sleep parameters across the lifespan, not many have included a representative sample of the general population. The objective of this study was to describe age-related changes in sleep structure, sleep respiratory parameters and periodic limb movements of the adult population of São Paulo. Methods: We selected a representative sample of the city of São Paulo, Brazil that included both genders and an age range of 20–80years. Pregnant and lactating women, people with physical or mental impairments that prevent self-care and people who work every night were not included. This sample included 1024 individuals who were submitted to polysomnography and structured interviews. We subdivided our sample into five-year age groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare age groups. Pearson product–moment was used to evaluate correlation between age and sleep parameters. Results: Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep showed a significant age-related decrease (P P < 0.05). Furthermore, apnea–hypopnea index increased and oxygen saturation decreased with age. The reduction in the percentage of REM sleep significantly correlated with age in women, whereas the reduction in the percentage of slow wave sleep correlated with age in men. The periodic limb movement (PLM) index increased with age in men and women. Conclusions: Sleep structure and duration underwent significant alterations throughout the aging process in the general population. There was an important correlation between age, sleep respiratory parameters and PLM index. In addition, men and women showed similar trends but with different effect sizes.

TI  - MDMA is certainly damaging after 25 years of empirical research: A reply and refutation of Doblin et al. (2014).
AU  - Parrott, Andrew C.
T2  - Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical and Experimental
AB  - Reply by the current author to the comments made by Rick Doblin (see record 2014-08230-002) on the original article (see record 2013-26822-003). Human Psychopharmacology recently published my review into the increase in empirical knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA over the past 25 years (Parrott, 2013a). Deficits have been demonstrated in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, complex visual processing, sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, pain, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status. Neuroimaging studies have shown serotonergic deficits, which are associated with lifetime Ecstasy/MDMA usage, and degree of neurocognitive impairment. Basic psychological skills remain intact. Ecstasy/MDMA use by pregnant mothers leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Hence, the damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA were far more widespread than was realized a few years ago. In their critique of my review, Doblin et al. (2014) argued that my review contained misstatements, omitted contrary findings, and recited dated misconceptions. In this reply, I have answered all the points they raised. I have been able to refute each of their criticisms by citing the relevant empirical data, since many of their points were based on inaccurate summaries of the actual research findings. Doblin and colleagues are proponents of the use of MDMA for drug‐assisted psychotherapy, and their strongest criticisms were focused on my concerns about this proposal. However, again all the issues I raised were based on sound empirical evidence or theoretical understanding. Indeed I would recommend potentially far safer co‐drugs such as D‐cycloserine or oxytocin. In summary, MDMA can induce a wide range of neuropsychobiological changes, many of which are damaging to humans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, & Neonatal Nursing: Clinical Scholarship for the Care of Women, Childbearing Families, & Newborns
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep quality, continuity, and quantity in a large cohort of pregnant women. Design: Prospective, longitudinal study. Participants: One hundred seventy (170) pregnant women at 10–20 weeks gestation. Methods: Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10–12, 14–16, and 18–20 weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time, averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain. Results: On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality (M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income p p < 0.05) following covariate adjustment. Conclusions: Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider.

In the original article, there were two errors in the affiliations. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-33304-004). In a retrospective cohort study undertaken in 12 European countries, 249 female narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (n = 216) and without cataplexy (n = 33) completed a self‐administrated questionnaire regarding pregnancy and childbirth. The cohort was divided further into patients whose symptoms of narcolepsy started before or during pregnancy (308 pregnancies) and those in whom the first symptoms of narcolepsy appeared after delivery (106 pregnancies). Patients with narcolepsy during pregnancy were older during their first pregnancy (P (P P P < 0.05). The mean birth weight and gestational age of neonates were within the normal range and did not differ across groups. Neonatal care was affected adversely by symptoms of narcolepsy in 60.1% of those with narcolepsy during pregnancy. This study reports more obstetric complications in patients with narcolepsy���cataplexy during pregnancy; however, these were not severe. This group also had a higher BMI and higher incidence of impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Caesarian section was conducted more frequently in narcolepsy–cataplexy patients, despite cataplexy being a rare event during delivery. Furthermore, symptoms of narcolepsy may render care of the infant more difficult. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the association between measures of objective sleep (OS) and subjective sleep (SS) to postpartum mood in healthy women from the third trimester of pregnancy to 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Twenty-nine pregnant women completed self-report measures of mood and SS, and wore actigraphs for 7 continuous days during the third trimester (Time 1), within 15 days (Time 2), and 10 to 12 weeks postpartum (Time 3). The subjective perception of marked daytime dysfunction was associated with low mood during Time 1 and Time 3. Poor nighttime SS was related to low mood only at Time 2, whereas poor nighttime OS influenced stress during the same assessment time. These data indicate a stronger association between postpartum mood and the subjective perception of sleep than with OS quality and duration in healthy, non-depressed women, and highlight the awareness of poor daytime functioning as a significant contributor to new mothers’ emotional wellbeing.

AB  - Objective: To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting and subjects: A total of 1765 women were invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11–16 weeks of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use. Main outcome measures: Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors, smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic medicine. Results: Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%). Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p < 0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with multiparity. Conclusions: Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting.

AB  - Background: Though migraine and tension type headache are both commonly diagnosed in childhood, little is known about their determinants when diagnosed prior to puberty onset. Our aim was to determine psychosocial- and health-related risk factors of migraine and tension-type headache in 11 year old children. Methods: 871 New Zealand European children were enrolled in a longitudinal study at birth and data were collected at birth, 1, 3.5, 7, and 11 years of age. Primary headache was determined at age 11 years based on the International Headache Society. Perinatal factors assessed were small for gestational age status, sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal perceived stress, and maternal school leaving age. Childhood factors assessed were sleep duration, percent body fat, television watching, parent and self-reported total problem behaviour, being bullied, and depression. Results: Prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was 10.5% and 18.6%, respectively. Both migraine and TTH were significantly associated with self-reported problem behaviour in univariable logistic regression analyses. Additionally, migraine was associated with reduced sleep duration, and both sleep and behaviour problems remained significant after multivariable analyses. TTH was also significantly associated with antenatal maternal smoking, higher body fat, and being bullied. For TTH, problem behaviour measured at ages 3.5 and 11 years both remained significant after multivariable analysis. Being born small for gestational age was not associated with either headache group. Conclusions: Although they share some commonality, migraine and tension-type headache are separate entities in childhood with different developmental characteristics. The association between primary headache and problem behaviour requires further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Haller, Dagmar M
T2  - Family Practice
AB  - Background and objective: Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are common in primary care and may cause severe pain and sleep disturbance. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of magnesium in treating NLC and the side-effect profile of magnesium compared to placebo. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform registries until August 2012. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing magnesium therapy for NLC in adults with any other comparator were eligible. Two investigators independently selected, extracted data from and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies. To compensate for the heterogeneity in outcome measures, simulations were used to summarize the data. Results: Seven RCTs were included in the review (n = 361), all comparing magnesium to placebo. Three of these trials included only pregnant women. The difference in the median number of leg cramps per week between the placebo and the intervention groups was 0.345 (quantile 2.5%: −0.133, quantile 97.5%: 0.875). This difference was 0.807 (quantile 2.5%: 0.015, quantile 97.5%: 1.207) in the three studies involving only pregnant women and 0.362 (quantile 2.5%: −0.386, quantile 97.5%: 1.148) in the others. Overall gastrointestinal side effects were slightly more common with magnesium therapy than with placebo. The strength of this evidence was weak, mainly due to small study sizes and short follow-up. Conclusions: Magnesium therapy does not appear to be effective in the treatment of NLC in the general population, but may have a small effect in pregnant women. Further research using better designed RCTs is necessary. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Alteration in the HPA axis is a robust biomarker of anxiety and depression in adults, but questions remain about this association in pregnancy. We examined the longitudinal links between diurnal cortisol and mood symptoms from self-report questionnaire and diagnostic interview in an ethnically diverse, psychosocially at-risk sample of 101 women at mid-pregnancy and early third trimester. There were modest but significant associations between depression and elevated cortisol, indexed by a decreased morning level and diminished diurnal decline; the effects were strongest for diagnostic data from clinical interview. These effects were independent of socio-demographic factors and sleep disturbance. Associations with anxiety and trauma were generally non-significant. These findings extend prior work by showing that significant mood symptoms in pregnancy are associated with altered diurnal cortisol in pregnancy, which may have implications for maternal and child health.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and its associated factors among pregnant women in Japan. Of the 940 randomly selected survey locations identified by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 344 obstetric institutions participated in the survey. The study was conducted on women with confirmed pregnancies who had had a second or subsequent consultation at one of these institutions. The survey items included age, highest educational achievement, trimester of pregnancy, number of pregnancies, employment status, smoking, alcohol consumption, restless sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, sleep duration, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and restless leg syndrome. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was used to assess the level of excessive daytime sleepiness. We calculated the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and then examined its associated factors using χ2 test and multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness among pregnant women was 6.2%. The results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly higher among younger women and those in an earlier trimester of pregnancy. The odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was also significantly higher for women in their first pregnancy, full‐time workers, and current alcohol consumers. Women indicating the presence of sleep‐related issues, including restless sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome, reported significantly higher levels of excessive daytime sleepiness.

AB  - Aim: To explore the role of maternal personality (hardiness), sleep‐related cognitions and bedtime involvement in child sleep behaviour during the second post‐natal year in a sample of spontaneous and assisted conception first‐time mothers. Method: Mothers (n = 134 (spontaneous (n = 81); assisted (n = 53) conception)) reported on a resilience measure (hardiness) during pregnancy and child sleep at 7 and 19 months post‐partum. At 19 months post‐partum, mothers also reported on their cognitions and involvement around their child's bedtime, and half the sample used Actigraph monitors (Acitiwatch‐16, Mini Mitter Co. Inc, Bend, OR, USA) to validate maternal report of child sleep. Results: No significant differences were found between spontaneous and assisted conception mothers on any of the study variables; therefore, assisted and spontaneous samples were combined. Structural equation modelling confirmed that lower pre‐birth maternal hardiness was associated with more problematic sleep‐related cognitions (β = 0.23, P P P < 0.001) during toddlerhood, even after considering concurrent maternal mood and child temperament. Conclusions: Pre‐birth maternal hardiness rather than mode of conception contributes to parenting cognitions and behaviour around child sleep and, ultimately, toddlers' sleep outcomes. Findings suggest that targeting negative maternal perceptions of control and efficacy through clinical interventions could benefit toddlers' sleep.

AB  - Circadian variation in biological rhythms has been identified as affecting both labour pain and the pharmacological properties of analgesics. In the context of pain, there is also a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of adult attachment. The purpose of this study was to examine whether labour pain, analgesic consumption and pharmacological effect are significantly affected by the time of day and to analyse whether this circadian variation is influenced by women’s attachment style. This prospective observational study included a sample of 81 pregnant women receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Attachment was assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale – Revised. The perceived intensity of labour pain in the early stage of labour (3 cm of cervical dilatation and before the administration of PCEA) was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain was also indirectly assessed by measuring the consumption of anaesthetics. The latency period and the duration of effect were recorded for a chronopharmacology characterisation. Pain, as assessed with the VAS, was significantly higher in the night-time group than in the daytime group. An insecure attachment style was significantly associated with greater labour pain at 3 cm of cervical dilatation (p p p < 0.05). The time of day was significantly associated with the pharmacological effect: the latency period was longer at night, and the duration of the pharmacological effect was longer during the daytime. The interaction between time of day and attachment style was not significant for any of the study variables. Our results provide evidence of the importance of circadian variation in studying labour pain and the pharmacological effect of labour analgesia involving epidural blockage with a PCEA regimen. Moreover, although there was no evidence that attachment style influenced the circadian variation, these data emphasise that insecure attachment patterns are a risk factor for greater labour pain and analgesic consumption, which should be considered in pain management approaches.

AB  - Objective: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in preterm infants (26–34weeks gestation). Methods: Two groups were tested in a single, level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; standard care or standard care plus FNI) using a randomized controlled trial design. The intervention consists of sessions designed to achieve mutual calm and promote communication of affect between infants and their mothers throughout the NICU stay. EEG recordings were obtained from 134 infants during sleep at ∼35 and ∼40weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Regional brain activity (power) was computed for 10 frequency bands between 1 and 48Hz in each of 125 electrodes. Results: Near to term age, compared to standard care infants, FNI infants showed robust increases in EEG power in the frontal polar region at frequencies 10 to 48Hz (20% to 36% with p-values1500g). Conclusion: FNI leads to increased frontal brain activity during sleep, which other investigators find predictive of better neurobehavioral outcomes. Significance: FNI may be a practicable means of improving outcomes in preterm infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the perinatal period using appraisal theory of emotions. Design: Repeated measures. Setting: Antenatal clinics of a health center associated with the Northern Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: 122 pregnant women in their third trimester of gestation. Methods: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and an appraisal questionnaire during the third trimester of gestation, within 7 to 10 days after childbirth, and at 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Correlational and regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and appraisals. Results: Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhood-related issues as well as with negative expectations about the future. Conclusions: Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are similar to those related to maternal distress identified by previous research. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between self-reports of sleep and maternal mood. Practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Pregnant women, both before and after childbirth, frequently experience memory deficits and disrupted sleep. In the present study we assessed the relationship between false memory generation and fragmented sleep during pregnancy and motherhood. We tested 178 pregnant women and 58 female non-pregnant childless controls, during pregnancy (15–35th week of gestation) and again after childbirth (8–13th month). False memories were defined as memories of gist words that were semantically related to studied word lists but were not presented during learning of these lists in the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy in the home environment for seven consecutive nights. Compared to the controls, the group of pregnant women produced more false memories and displayed more fragmented sleep both during pregnancy and after childbirth. However, false memory generation was not correlated to measures of sleep fragmentation. These results show that pregnant women suffer from sleep fragmentation and a higher susceptibility to false memories, but leave open the question as to whether both phenomena are related.

AB  - Study Objectives: A recent trend in increasing rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality despite quality improvements has been noted. The goal of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality. Design: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. Setting: A nationally representative sample of maternal hospital discharges from 1998-2009. Patients or Participants: The analytic sample included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000; however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2–2.9), eclampsia (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3–8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5–10.9), and pulmonary embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3–8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4–11.5). The adverse effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity. Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may improve pregnancy outcomes in this group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Presents a case report of a 5-year-old girl affected by macrocrania due to benign external hydrocephalus with nocturnal lagophthalmos and SEM during NREM sleep. The patient, a girl of Ethiopian origin and Amhara ethnicity, was born at term after regular pregnancy. She had a negative familial medical history. At the age of 3 months she presented macrocrania, without neurological signs, and findings of enlarged subarachnoid spaces at cerebral ultrasound, confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging at 3 years. The macrocrania and her nocturnal lagophthalmos appeared to be inherited after viewing the photos and clinical history of her mother. She had no history of seizures. This report highlights the association of physiological nocturnal lagophthalmos in a familial hereditary case of Amhara ethnicity with another phenomenon, that of SEM during NREM sleep, otherwise not observable with the eyes closed.

AU  - Gentile, Salvatore
T2  - Psychopharmacology and pregnancy: Treatment efficacy, risks, and guidelines.
AB  - Antenatal anxiety may adversely impact on several aspects of fetal maturation, pregnancy, the puerperium, and child development, thus demonstrating an intrinsic teratogenic structural, gestational, and neurobehavioral liability. Moreover, insomnia during the first trimester of pregnancy is quite common and is usually a result of associated hormonal changes. Insomnia is also common during the third trimester of pregnancy. There are a number of reasons for this, but by far the most common is the discomfort as the mother gets bigger and her baby begins to place more pressure on her internal organs, making it more difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. However, when possible, benzodiazepines should be avoided in both the first trimester and third trimester of pregnancy because of possible structural teratogenicity (especially, anal atresia and other gastrointestinal tract anomalies, and oral cleft), ascertained gestational teratogenity (spontaneous abortion) when taken in overdose, and ascertained perinatal teratogenicity (neonatal withdrawal syndromes). As regards hypnotic agents, preliminary data, although apparently encouraging, are too limited to confirm or exclude a potential structural teratogenic liability. Above all, concordant safety signals seem to discourage the use of hypnotic agents during pregnancy because of an increase in the risk of gestational teratogenicity (preterm birth, low birth weight, and babies small for gestational age). Given these considerations, interventions alternative to pharmacological treatments should be considered first-line options for managing anxiety and sleep disorders in pregnancy.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - Research indicates that poor sleep quality is linked to and may precede depressive symptomatology in pregnancy, complicating screening for either condition. Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores of probable depression (X² 13.39; p X² 9.20 p X² 20.78; p < 0.001). This study confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI).

T2  - Translating psychological research into practice.
AB  - Postpartum depression is major or minor depression that is manifest in the first year after child birth. It is characterized by typical symptoms of major depression including depressive mood, loss of interest, sleep and appetite disturbances, difficulties in concentration and decision making, psychomotor agitation or retardation, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation. These symptoms may arise any time in the postpartum period or even carry over from pregnancy; however, the first 3 months after delivery appears to be the period of highest risk and greatest salience to mothers and health care professionals. Postpartum depression should be distinguished from the postpartum blues, which refers to a common mild clinical state that is manifest in the first week to 10 days postpartum. The blues are typically transitory but do serve as a known risk factor for postpartum depression. On the opposite end of the severity spectrum is postpartum psychosis, which is a severe disorder characterized by hallucinations and delusions and usually reflects bipolar disorder. Postpartum psychosis is often manifest early in the postpartum period, usually within the first 2 weeks and typically has an acute onset. Treatment usually involves hospitalization. Postpartum psychosis is not considered to be on a continuum with postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is often comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety disorders. Postpartum depression is particularly consequential because it occurs at a time of the increased demands on a woman associated with infant care. Postpartum women are particularly likely to experience sleep interruptions, withdrawal from the work force, and isolation from friends. For women who are depressed, these stressors can exacerbate negative mood and lead to further impairment in functioning. Of particular concern is the fact that postpartum depression is associated with suboptimal mother-infant interaction as well as negative consequences for the infant in the realms of social, emotional, and cognitive development.

T2  - Sleep Medicine
AB  - Background: Cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors are linked to increased morbidity. Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors. Methods: Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI)), were collected thrice from pregnant women (N = 161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10–12 weeks), T2 (14–16 weeks) and T3 (18–20 weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were dichotomised using established clinical cut-offs. Results: BMI and BP significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL ≥ 20 min had greater BMI than women without persistent SOL ≥ 20 min prior to covariate adjustment at T1 and T2, but at T3 the BMI values converged. Similar results were observed for persistent WASO ≥ 30 min. Persistently long WASO, as measured by actigraphy, was associated with elevated SBP, after controlling for covariates. Conclusions: Consistent with anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report substantial difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep during early pregnancy and this may augment the risk of higher BP and BMI. Understanding these relationships is important as CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for appropriate intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Summary Hypocretin/orexin peptides are known for their role in the control of the wake–sleep cycle and narcolepsy–cataplexy pathophysiology. Recent studies suggested that hypocretin peptides also have a role in pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a retrospective analysis on pregnancy complications in two different mouse models of hypocretin deficiency. We recorded 85 pregnancies of mice lacking either hypocretin peptides (knockout) or hypocretin‐releasing neurons (transgenic) and their wild‐type controls. Pregnancy was associated with unexplained dam death before delivery in 3/15 pregnancies in knockout mice, and in 3/23 pregnancies in transgenic mice. No casualties occurred in wild‐type pregnant dams (P < 0.007 versus hypocretin‐deficient mice as a whole). Hypocretin deficiency did not impact either on litter size or the number of weaned pups per litter. These data provide preliminary evidence of a critical role of hypocretin deficiency in pregnancy.

TI  - Maternal psychological state and infant’s temperament at three months.
AU  - Vedova, A. M. Della
T2  - Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology
AB  - Objective: The study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child’s temperament at 3 months postpartum. Background: The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may increase the risk of the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence. Methods: A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament. Results: Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To determine whether maternal mental health mediates the relationship between eczema or asthma symptoms and mental well-being in children. Study design: Analysis of 7250 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Child mental well-being at 8 years was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Binary outcomes were high ‘internalizing’ (anxious/depressive) and ‘externalizing’ (oppositional/hyperactive) problems (high was > 90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were ‘none’; ‘early onset transient’ (infancy/preschool only); ‘persistent’ (infancy/preschool and at school age); and ‘late onset’ (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old. Results: Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74, 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep, attenuated these associations. Persistent rash (externalizing: 1.74, 1.40-2.15; internalizing: 1.42, 1.16-1.74) and late onset rash (externalizing: 1.62, 1.17-2.25; internalizing: 1.46, 1.07-1.99) symptoms were associated with poorer mental well-being compared with no rash at any age. Maternal anxiety and depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly for externalizing symptoms. Sleep disruption did not mediate the association. Conclusions: Maternal anxiety and depression may mediate the association between child rash and wheeze and child mental well-being.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the transition to parenthood and mental health in first‐time parents in detail and explore any differences in this transition in the context of parental gender and postpartum mental health. Semistructured clinical interviews (Birmingham Interview for Maternal Mental Health) were carried out with 46 women and 40 men, 5 months after birth. Parents were assessed on pre‐ and postpartum anxiety, depression, and postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a range of adjustment and relationship variables. One fourth of the men and women reported anxiety in pregnancy, reducing to 21% of women and 8% of men after birth. Pregnancy and postpartum depression rates were roughly equal, with 11% of women and 8% of men reporting depression. Postpartum PTSD was experienced by 5% of parents. Postpartum mental health problems were significantly associated with postpartum sleep deprivation (odds ratio [OR] = 7.5), complications in labor (OR = 5.1), lack of postpartum partner support (OR = 8.0), feelings of parental unworthiness (OR = 8.3), and anger toward the infant (OR = 4.4). Few gender differences were found for these variables. This study thus highlights the importance of focusing interventions on strengthening the couple's relationship and avoiding postnatal sleep deprivation, and to address parents’ feelings of parental unworthiness and feelings of anger toward their baby.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety are important mood changes in childbearing women. However, changes in depression and anxiety over time in women who undergo an elective cesarean section (CS) have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to characterize the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and patterns of co-occurrence, and examined the associated predictors of depression and anxiety courses. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of childbearing women (N = 139) who underwent a CS was conducted. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were respectively assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Anxiety Inventory, in the third trimester and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Group-based modeling identified three distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms: group 1 (low, 30.9%), group 2 (mild, 41.7%), and group 3 (high, 27.3%). Four group trajectories of anxiety symptoms were identified: group 1 (low, 19.4%), group 2 (mild, 44.6%), group 3 (high, 28.8%), and group 4 (very high, 7.2%). Mild symptoms of both depression and anxiety were the most common joint trajectory. Depression trajectories were significantly related to anxiety trajectories (p < 0.001). Predictors of the joint trajectory included the pre-pregnant body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1∼6.3) and a poor sleep score (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4∼7.3) in the third trimester. Conclusions: Distinctive trajectories and co-occurrence patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to continuous assessment of psychological well-being among women who undergo an elective CS.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effect of maternal presence on the physiological and behavioral status of the preterm infant when exposed to recorded music versus ambient sound. Design: Repeated‐measures randomized controlled trial. Setting: Special care nursery (SCN) in a tertiary perinatal center. Participants: Clinically stable preterm infants (22) born at > 28 weeks gestation and enrolled at > 32 weeks gestation and their mothers. Methods: Infants were exposed to lullaby music (6 minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6 minutes recorded lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12 minutes (baseline and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent overall. Results: There was no discernible infant response to music and therefore no significant impact of maternal presence on infant's response to music over time. However during the mothers’ presence (first 12 minutes), the infants exhibited significantly higher oxygen saturation than during their absence p = .024) and less time spent in quiet sleep after their departure, though this was not significant. Conclusion: Infants may have been unable to detect the music against the ambient soundscape. Regardless of exposure to music, the infants’ physiological and behavioral regulation were affected by the presence and departure of the mothers.

AB  - This review includes six recent and influential papers that have appeared in the three leading psychiatry journals from the Arab region. The first paper examined the role of personality profile in the motivation to quit smoking and concluded that there is a positive correlation between Novelty seeking (NS), Persistence (P), Cooperativeness (C) and motivation to quit smoking. The second study discussed the prevalence of abuse history in patients with schizophrenia whether physical or sexual, and its impact on their condition and function. The third paper reported that patients with substance abuse problem show more risky sexual behaviors than normal controls. The fourth study high-lighted the similarities regarding complaints about sleep and polysomnographic changes in depression patients and somatoform disorder patients. The fifth paper, investigated the prenatal and perinatal risk factors in autistic disorders. The sixth and final article concluded that poor levels of maternal fetal attachment during the course of pregnancy should be managed in order to optimize fetal and maternal health. Overall, the papers describe a wide spectrum of research initiatives in the Arab world that are likely to have implications for global mental health.

AU  - Kawada, Tomoyuki
T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Comments on an article by M. V. Smith et al. (see record 2013-00500-005). Smith et al. described the neurobehavioral effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors during the last trimester of pregnancy on neonates. As part of their study, Actiwatch® and the Actiware-Sleep software were used to make activity assessments. These data were used to judge sleep, wake, and the number of wakes during the monitoring period within one hour. As a preliminary setting of actigraphy, Actiwatch® requires the cut-off value of sensitivity for sleep/wake judgment. As expected, the low and high sensitivity settings yield different results on sleep/ wake judgment. Low sensitivity setting requires a greater number of movements for wake judgment than medium sensitivity setting, and high sensitivity setting requires a smaller number of movements for wake judgment than medium sensitivity setting. Unfortunately, there is no description on the cut-off point in the papers presented by Smith et al. and they selected the medium level of cut-off value as an initial setting. There is no definite evidence to determine the best sensitivity threshold of actigraphy for infants. As the number of cases is extremely limited in their study, the author recommend themto conduct further study with the consideration of cut-off value of sensitivity for actigraphy.

AB  - Provides a brief overview of a study which examined the effectiveness of music therapy for preterm neonates. For a while the literature on music therapy for preterm infants was more feel-good than science with relatively few studies of poor quality. The study was a multicentre randomized trial in which 272 infants of 32 weeks gestation served as their own controls examined changes in heart rate, sucking behavior and sleep when infants were played parent preferred song of kin culturally significant lullabies, breathing sounds, heartbeat rhythms or left in peace. Infants’ heart rates were significantly lower over time with all three interventions compared with controls. All interventions but particularly ocean disc showed an increase in positive sleep patterns. Sucking behavior improved with gato box. Oxygen saturation improved with lullaby, but more with Twinkle than with song of kin. Parental stress decreased when any music was played. This study gives some evidence that music helps preterm infants and their parents and is unique in the type of music studied. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The baby as subject: Clinical studies in infant-parent therapy.
AB  - The current chapter presents the differences in characteristics of two infants named Bella and Minnie. These two infants are very different but they were both caught up in marital conflict. As Daws pointed out, "When parents have an estranged relationship, the baby's experience will not only be pf a mother being in difficulties with being emotionally available to him, but he will also sense that his parents are not performing this for each other." Bella had good, self-regulation and was a settled toddler who slept well at night. After a violent exchange between her parents there was a change in Bella's sleeping pattern and her behavior. She was probably angry with her parents and frightened to go to sleep at night. Her mother brought her to see me in the hope of gaining some understanding of Bella's distress. In contrast, Minnie's distress began from birth, or possibly even earlier, in the pregnancy. Minnie was a "much wanted" baby whose mother had gone to great lengths to conceive her despite waiting until she was in her forties to plan a baby, which was a clue to her ambivalence about a having a child. Through capturing my gaze and looking from me to her mother, Minnie seemed to be entreating me to help her and her mother, and to link us. Gradually Muinie warmed up and as her mother was able to see her experience, and Minnie's depression, although it took many months, lifted.

AB  - Objective: Sleep deficiency is an emerging concept denoting a deficit in the quantity or quality of sleep. This may be particularly salient for pregnant women since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation (10–20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms and stress. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 160) with no self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10–12, 14–16, and 18–20 weeks’ gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results: Approximately 28%–38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient (p p = 0.02). Discussion: Sleep deficiency is a useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Sleep credit and debit: Grey matter and emotional intelligence in the balance?
AU  - Dijk, Derk‐Jan
T2  - Journal of Sleep Research
AB  - This editorial discusses the involvement of grey matter and emotional intelligence in regulating sleep balance. The authors of one of the article reports that sleep credit correlated positively with grey matter volume in medial prefrontal cortex which, in turn, correlated positively with measures of emotional intelligence and mental health. Another article reports the prevalence of insomnia as assessed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, DSM-IV, DSM-V or quantitative criteria for insomnia of 23.8, 18.5 and 13.6%, respectively. In many of the articles, estimates of sleep duration, sleep deficits and credits were based on self-report. How well self-reported sleep duration correlates with sleep duration as measured by the sleep scientist, using actigraphy or polysomnography, has been investigated previously in healthy volunteers and insomnia patients. With regard to narcolepsy in Europe and pregnancy, there are two articles featured in this issue of Journal of Sleep Research. The first article provides a comprehensive assessment of clinical, sleep and genetic characteristics of 1099 patients in the retrospective database of the European Narcolepsy Network Maurovich and the second article reports on some aspects of narcolepsy in relation to pregnancy.

In the original article, there were two errors in the affiliations. The corrections are present in the erratum.] In a retrospective cohort study undertaken in 12 European countries, 249 female narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (n = 216) and without cataplexy (n = 33) completed a self‐administrated questionnaire regarding pregnancy and childbirth. The cohort was divided further into patients whose symptoms of narcolepsy started before or during pregnancy (308 pregnancies) and those in whom the first symptoms of narcolepsy appeared after delivery (106 pregnancies). Patients with narcolepsy during pregnancy were older during their first pregnancy (P (P P P < 0.05). The mean birth weight and gestational age of neonates were within the normal range and did not differ across groups. Neonatal care was affected adversely by symptoms of narcolepsy in 60.1% of those with narcolepsy during pregnancy. This study reports more obstetric complications in patients with narcolepsy–cataplexy during pregnancy; however, these were not severe. This group also had a higher BMI and higher incidence of impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Caesarian section was conducted more frequently in narcolepsy–cataplexy patients, despite cataplexy being a rare event during delivery. Furthermore, symptoms of narcolepsy may render care of the infant more difficult. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess frequency, characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and its impact on sleep. Methods: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen. Results: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week; 45% had an IRLSS > 20 and 100% had a PSQI > 5. Hemoglobin levels < 11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS. Conclusion: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Some studies report neurobehavioral symptoms in neonates exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in utero. However, maternal psychiatric illness during the last trimester of pregnancy, as a confounding factor, has not always been assessed. Aims: In this prospective study we compared neurobehavioral complications among neonates who were born to euthymic women who either took or did not take an SRI during the last trimester of pregnancy. Study design: Exposed and unexposed infants were assessed for: 1) temperament as measured by the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS); 2) activity via Actiwatch electronic monitoring; 3) sleep state using trained observer ratings; and 4) perinatal complications through medical record review. T-tests, Fisher's exact tests, and analyses of covariance were used to assess the relationship between clinical and neurobehavioral factors and exposure status. Subjects: 67 infants (61 controls and 6 exposed to SRIs). Outcome measures: Neonatal Assessment Behavioral Scale, APGAR scores, infant sleep state (% sleep, % wakeful), startles and tremulousness, gestational age, birth weight, and head circumference. Results: Infants exposed to SRIs in the third trimester had poorer motor development, lower 5-minute APGAR scores, and shorter mean gestational age as compared to unexposed infants. Conclusion: Results of this study show differences in autonomic and gross motor activity between neonates who were or were not exposed to SRIs in utero after controlling for active maternal psychiatric illness. Future longitudinal work should compare longer term outcomes of exposed and unexposed infants of depressed mothers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rational: Depression is prevalent among women of childbearing age and is frequently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). As some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Flx), can cross the placenta, it is possible that the neurodevelopment of the fetus may be affected, leading to altered behavior in adulthood. Objectives: In this study, we examined the effects of perinatal Flx exposure on the subsequent expression of circadian rhythms in adult mice. Methods: Dams were treated with 25 mg/kg/day Flx in their drinking water from embryonic day 15 to postnatal day 12. Circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed in the offspring starting at 6 weeks of age. Results: We found that perinatal Flx exposure led to larger light-induced phase advances (1.19±0.51 vs. 0.55±0.25 h), smaller phase advances to the serotonin agonist 8-OH-DPAT during the mid-subjective day (0.44 ± 0.15 vs. 0.70 ± 0.17 h), and a shorter free-running period in constant darkness (23.47 ± 0.13 vs. 23.64 ± 0.13 h). Conclusions: These results suggest that perinatal exposure to SSRIs may have consequences for the functioning of the circadian system later in life.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological movement disorder that is often seen in multiple sclerosis patients. However, the association between RLS and multiple sclerosis (MS) is still unclear and RLS is not considered as one of the MS symptoms. This study was conducted to assess the frequency of RLS and its associated factors in patients with MS. This was a cross-sectional study conducted during January and April 2010. A total of 205 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (164 females, 41 males, mean age 32.8 ± 8.9 years) were enrolled in the study and underwent a medical history interview and a neurological examination. The diagnosis of RLS was based on International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Criteria. 57 patients (27.8 %) met the RLS diagnostic criteria. In 90.1 % of the patients, the onset of RLS was simultaneous with or followed by MS onset. There was no significant difference between patients with and without RLS in respect of age, gender, disease duration, and MS pattern. There was an increased incidence of leg jerks before sleep in patients with RLS (P = 0.04). In patients suffering from RLS, there is greater complaint of insomnia (P = 0.03). Body mass index, history of anemia, excessive day-time somnolence, consuming caffeine containing beverages, pregnancy numbers, smoking, and alcohol consumption were not associated with the presence of RLS. This study revealed high prevalence of RLS in MS patients. Screening of RLS in these patients should be always considered in order to improve management of MS.

AB  - Objective: Using two cohorts born 29 years apart in Dunedin, New Zealand we aim to examine changes in risk factors and their associations with body mass index (BMI) at ages 3 and 7 years, and estimate their contribution to the secular changes in BMI at age 7 years. Methods: Birth weight and anthropometric measures at ages 3, 5 and 7 years were obtained for 974 participants in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (DMHDS), born in 1972–1973, and 241 in the Family Lifestyle, Activity, Movement and Eating Study (FLAME), born in 2001–2002. Information about maternal age, education and smoking in pregnancy, as well as breastfeeding, children's television time and time in bed, was obtained by questionnaire. Results: The increase in BMI over the 29-year period was 0.84 (95% CI 0.61, 1.06) kg m−2 at age 7. A 1-unit difference in the mother's BMI was associated with a 0.06 (0.03, 0.08) kg m−2 difference in offspring in both studies; the 3.4 (2.8, 4.0) kg m−2 increase in the mothers’ BMIs accounts for a change of 0.19 kg m−2 in the children's BMI. The much smaller generational increase in fathers’ BMI (0.7 kg m−2) correspondingly had a more limited effect on change in child BMI over time (0.06 kg m−2). Although smoking in pregnancy decreased by 15% (8, 21) its association with BMI increased from 0.20 (−0.01, 0.42) in the DMHDS cohort to 1.24 (0.76, 1.71) kg m−2 in the FLAME cohort, contributing 0.18 kg m−2 to the increase in children's BMI. Conclusions: Societal factors such as higher maternal BMI and smoking in pregnancy contribute most to the secular increase in BMI, with changes in behavioural factors, including sleep and television viewing, having little effect in this setting.

T2  - Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care
AB  - Background: Advances in genetic technologies have resulted in the diagnosis during pregnancy of increasing numbers of fetal abnormalities. A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals’ interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover. Conclusions: This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Sleep and Biological Rhythms
AB  - This letter presents a study that aims to explore the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) for pregnant women in Asian countries compared to European and North American countries. The study conducted face to face interviews with a total of 200 pregnant women hospitalized prior to delivery using a set of standardized questions for RLS diagnosis, folic acid tablet and iron rich sustenance intake levels as well as sleep problems. Among the 200 Chinese participants, 17% of the pregnant women had RLS. The current results provides important evidence supporting the notion that the prevalence of RLS is indeed considerably lower for pregnant women in Asian countries compared to those of European and North American countries. In addition, it was found that a significantly lower mean hemoglobin level and greater percentage of iron-rich sustenance intake for women with RLS is supposedly linked with a greater percentage of anemia in pregnant women with RLS. This may lead to a phenomenon that sees a higher percentage of iron intake in pregnant women with RLS than in pregnant women without RLS. However, the limitation of this work was that the investigation was carried out in a single institute and was not over long period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We tested if the risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with PTSD symptoms was dependent on comorbid sleep disturbance. Our cross-sectional sample included 2465 participants with complete data from the 21 year follow-up of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a birth cohort study of young Australians. Using structural equation modelling with indirect pathways we found that 12 month PTSD symptoms did not directly predict suicidal ideation at 21 when adjusting for major depression symptoms, polyvictimization and gender. However, PTSD symptoms had an indirect effect on suicidal ideation via past-month sleep disturbance. Our results suggest that increased suicidal ideation in those with PTSD may result from the fact that PTSD sufferers often exhibit other comorbid psychiatric conditions which are themselves known to predict suicidal behaviours. Sleep disturbance may be targeted in those who experience PTSD to help prevent suicidal ideation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

A study of postpartum depression in a fast developing country: prevalence and related factors. Int J Psychiat Med 2012;43:325–337.] Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. Results: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p = 0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. Conclusion: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.

T2  - Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are currently diagnosed in the presence of impairments in social interaction and communication, and a restricted range of activities and interests. However, there is considerable variability in the behaviors of different individuals with an ASD diagnosis. The heterogeneity spans the entire range of IQ and language abilities, as well as other behavioral, communicative, and social functions. While any psychiatric condition is likely to incorporate a degree of heterogeneity, the variability in the nature and severity of behaviors observed in ASD is thought to exceed that of other disorders. The current paper aims to provide a model for future research into ASD subgroups. In doing so, we examined whether two proposed risk factors—low birth weight (LBW), and in utero exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—are associated with greater behavioral homogeneity. Using data from the Western Australian Autism Biological Registry, this study found that LBW and maternal SSRI use during pregnancy were associated with greater sleep disturbances and a greater number of gastrointestinal complaints in children with ASD, respectively. The findings from this “proof of principle” paper provide support for this “bottom-up” approach as a feasible method for creating homogenous groups.

AB  - Background: Poor sleep, common during pregnancy, is associated with negative health risks. The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant insomnia among pregnant Latinas. Methods: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISl) and questions about demographics and sleep. Results: Clinically significant insomnia (ISl ≥ 10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS ≥ 9 and 9% with EPDS < 9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26% versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%) was experienced by women with EPDS ≥ 9 who completed measures in English. The lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by women with EPDS < 9 who completed measures in Spanish. Conclusions: In this sample of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas. Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation, as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors (e.g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be important to directly test this explanation in future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Effects of coadministration of D-napvsipq {NAP} and D-sallrsipa {SAL} on spatial learning after developmental alcohol exposure.
AU  - Wagner, Jennifer L.
AB  - Despite warnings about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy, little progress has been made in reducing alcohol drinking among women of childbearing age. Even after the recognition of pregnancy, 15% of women continue to drink, 3% of which admit to binge drinking. Because we cannot stop women from drinking during pregnancy, and many children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are adopted, there is a significant need to develop postnatal interventions that can improve the long-term outcome of children adversely affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This thesis aims to evaluate one promising new treatment in the rehabilitation or rescue of specific learning deficits long after the damage has occurred. The treatment evaluated herein (40µg D-NAP + 40µg D-SAL) has long been used in the prevention of the detrimental effects of long-term and binge-like alcohol exposures in rodent models of fetal alcohol syndrome and FASD. Until recently this peptide treatment had only been shown to be effective in preventing some of the consequences of alcohol exposure when administered concurrently with the prenatal alcohol exposure. A recent report by Incerti and colleagues (2010c), however, reported that these peptides could completely reverse a profound spatial learning deficit induced by one episode of a heavy binge-like alcohol exposure (5.9g.kg in a single intraperitoneal injection) on gestational day 8 (G8) in C57BL/6 mice. In that report, the peptide treatment was administered starting in late adolescence, beginning three days prior to and throughout water maze training, and the profound deficits in their alcohol-placebo group were completely eliminated in the alcohol-peptide group. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for FASD. An effective treatment for the cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions suffered by the 1% of people born today could potentially improve the lives of millions of children and adults. The first aim of this thesis was to determine whether the peptide treatment could reverse the significant spatial learning deficits we have demonstrated in adult C57BL/6 mice given high-dose binge-like alcohol exposure (2.5 g/kg in each of two intraperitoneal injections separated by two hours) on postnatal day (P)7. When administered three days prior to and throughout water maze testing (P67-76), the peptide treatment had no effect on spatial learning. The second aim sought to determine whether the same peptide treatment could reverse water maze spatial learning deficits in G8 binge-like exposure models, as reported by Incerti et al. (2010c). For this analysis, the first study used a different binge-like alcohol exposure model that is more commonly used than that employed by the Incerti et al. (2010c) study, namely administration of 2.8g/kg in each of two intraperitoneal injections separated by four hours (Sulik et al., 1981). This model has been shown to produce high peak blood alcohol concentrations and neuroanatomical aberrations in the hippocampal formation and septal regions (Parnell et al., 2009), which have been implicated in learning and memory. Surprisingly, this G8 binge-like alcohol exposure failed to produce a spatial learning deficit, undermining the usefulness of this model in evaluating the peptide effects. In direct contrast to the outcomes of Incerti et al. (2010c), the G8 Webster alcohol exposure was also unable to produce any deficits in acquisition of spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Surprisingly, neither of the heavy binge-like alcohol exposures on G8 were able to produce spatial learning deficits in the Morris water maze. The binge-like alcohol exposure on P7 did yield the expected spatial learning deficit, but the peptide treatment was unsuccessful in recovering water maze learning. These findings fail to support oral administration of 40µg D-NAP and 40 µg D-SAL as a potential therapy for postnatal alcohol-induced spatial learning deficits in adult mice.

T2  - Epilepsy & Behavior
AB  - Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of children under the age of 15, making it a very common neurological disorder in the pediatric population (Russ et al., 2012 [1]). In addition, ~0.4–0.8% of all pregnant women have some form of epilepsy (Hauser et al., 1996a,b; Borthen et al., 2009; Krishnamurthy, 2012 [2–5]). Despite the potential deleterious effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the developing brain, their use is still required for seizure control in pregnant women (Krishnamurthy, 2012 [5]), and they represent the standard approach for treating children with epilepsy (Chu-Shore and Thiele, 2010; Quach et al., 2010; Verrotti et al., 2011 [6–8]). Even when AEDs are effective, there are potential side effects, including cognitive and affective changes or altered sleep and appetite. The consequences of AED exposure in development have been studied extensively (Canger et al., 1999; Modi et al., 2011a,b; Oguni, 2011 [9–12]). Despite intensive study, there is still debate about the long-term consequences of early life AED exposure. Here, we consider the evidence to date that AED exposure, either prenatally or in early postnatal life, has significant adverse effects on the developing brain and incorporate studies of laboratory animals as well as those of patients. We also note the areas of research where greater clarity seems critical in order to make significant advances. A greater understanding of the impact of AEDs on somatic, cognitive and behavioral development has substantial value because it has the potential to inform clinical practice and guide studies aimed at understanding the genetic and molecular bases of comorbid pathologies associated with common treatment regimens. Understanding these effects has the potential to lead to AEDs with fewer side effects. Such advances would expand treatment options, diminish the risk associated with AED exposure in susceptible populations, and improve the quality of life and health outcomes of children with epilepsy and children born to women who took AEDs during pregnancy.

AB  - Agomelatine is a novel antidepressant acting as an MT₁/MT₂ melatonin receptor agonist/5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. Because of its peculiar pharmacological profile, this drug caters the potential to correct the abnormalities of circadian rhythms associated with mood disorders, including abnormalities of the sleep/wake cycle. Here, we examined the effect of chronic agomelatine treatment on sleep architecture and circadian rhythms of motor activity using the rat model of prenatal restraint stress (PRS) as a putative 'aetiological' model of depression. PRS was delivered to the mothers during the last 10 d of pregnancy. The adult progeny ('PRS rats') showed a reduced duration of slow wave sleep, an increased duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increased number of REM sleep events and an increase in motor activity before the beginning of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. In addition, adult PRS rats showed an increased expression of the transcript of the primary response gene, c-Fos, in the hippocampus just prior to the beginning of the dark phase. All these changes were reversed by a chronic oral treatment with agomelatine (2000 ppm in the diet). The effect of agomelatine on sleep was largely attenuated by treatment with the MT₁/MT₂ melatonin receptor antagonist, S22153, which caused PRS-like sleep disturbances on its own. These data provide the first evidence that agomelatine corrects sleep architecture and restores circadian homeostasis in a preclinical model of depression and supports the value of agomelatine as a novel antidepressant that resynchronizes circadian rhythms under pathological conditions.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - Women are at increased risk of developing mood disorders during the postpartum period, and poor postpartum sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of depression. This longitudinal study investigated the relationship between sleep variables and postpartum depression symptoms using wrist actigraphy and self-report surveys. Twenty-five healthy primiparous women were recruited from their outpatient obstetricians’ offices from July 2009 through March 2010. Subjects wore wrist actigraphs for 1 week during the third trimester of pregnancy and again during the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th weeks postpartum while completing sleep logs and sleep surveys. Subjective assessments of mood were collected at the end of each actigraph week. Subjective sleep assessments were strongly predictive of depression severity scores as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) across all weeks (p < 0.001). Actigraphic measures of sleep maintenance, such as sleep fragmentation, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset, were also significantly correlated with EPDS scores postpartum. However, there was no relationship between nocturnal sleep duration and EPDS scores. This study provides additional evidence that poor sleep maintenance as measured by wrist actigraphy, rather than lesser amounts of sleep, is associated with EPDS scores during the postpartum period and that subjective assessments of sleep may be more accurate predictors of postpartum depression symptoms than wrist actigraphy. It also supports the hypothesis that disrupted sleep may contribute to the development and extent of postpartum depression symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: Perinatal changes in maternal sleep patterns may modify circadian phase. Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Twelve women (age ± SD = 26.9 ± 5 years) who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase. Results: Nine women had DLMO phase shifts ≥30 min. On average ± SD, new mothers phase delayed 42 ± 80min (range = 163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6. Limitations: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require replication. Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders.

T2  - Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment
AB  - Mood disorders are a major public health problem and are associated with considerable burden of disease, suicides, physical comorbidities, high economic costs, and poor quality of life. Approximately 30%–40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidence-based data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John’s wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective.

AB  - We prospectively examined the associations of nighttime and daytime sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy with labor duration and risk of cesarean deliveries in a convenience sample of 120 nulliparous women who completed sleep‐related questionnaires and wore wrist actigraphs for up to 7 days. Nap duration and 24‐hour sleep duration were inversely associated with labor duration in women with vaginal delivery. Neither actigraphy‐derived nor self‐reported sleep variables were associated with type of delivery (e.g., vaginal, cesarean). Results showed a beneficial effect of sleep on labor duration and suggest that studies of sleep duration effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes require a consideration of the amount of both daytime and nighttime sleep.

T2  - Psychosomatic Medicine
AB  - Objective: Disturbed sleep and depression are potential risk factors for pregnancy complications. Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health. Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse outcomes. Methods: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n = 168) at 20 and 30 weeks’ gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth weight, and peripartum events. Results: Among depressed women, short sleep duration (p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor necrosis factor > (A = 0.105, p = .024). Aspects of poor sleep were associated with having a lower weight baby (p values p = .032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (β = 105.2, p = .085), interferon-F and lower birth weight (β = -19.92, p p < .083) were observed. Conclusions: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Epilepsy & Behavior
AB  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy and a fairly lifelong disorder that may significantly lower a patient's expectations and potential for a full life. Luckily, it is also a highly treatable disorder, and up to 85% of patients with JME will enjoy satisfactory seizure control. Among anticonvulsants, valproate still stands out as the most efficacious drug, but may be poorly tolerated by some, and is considered unsafe for the fetuses of pregnant women. Alternatives have emerged in recent years, especially levetiracetam, but also topiramate, zonisamide or lamotrigine. In some cases, combination therapy may be useful or even required. One should not forget the potential aggravation induced not only by some commonly used anticonvulsants, especially carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, but also, in some patients, by lamotrigine. In special settings, older drugs like benzodiazepines and barbiturates may be useful. But the management of JME should also include intervention in lifestyle, with strict avoidance of sleep deprivation and the management of copathologies, including the cognitive and psychiatric problems that are often encountered. With adequate management, there will only remain a small proportion of patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and all of its related problems. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a condition in which the clinician has a fair chance of significantly helping the patient with medication and counseling.

T2  - MCN: The American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing
AB  - Purpose: This study examined the patterns and psychosocial predictors of sleep quality in Taiwanese pregnant women. Study Design and Methods: A cross-sectional, correlational study design was used. A convenience sample of 400 pregnant women from two urban hospitals in Taiwan participated in this study. Data were collected using six self-report measures: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Attitude to Body Image Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List. Results: Our findings revealed that the prevalence of pregnancy-associated sleep disturbance (PSQI score > 5) was 65.5%, The mean score of the global PSQI was 7.25 ± 3.43, indicating that participant pregnant women in general reported mild sleep disturbance. Trend analyses of PSQI score indicated linear trend, with a gradual decline in the sleep quality as the pregnancy progressed. Sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality scores differed significantly by trimesters. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the best subsets to predict sleep quality were prenatal depression, prepregnancy sleep quality, current body image, and week of gestation for Taiwanese pregnant women. Clinical Implications: These findings offer evidence that healthcare professionals should provide sleep counseling to pregnant women, and incorporate depression and body image into a supportive model of sleep-related prenatal care.

AB  - Socioeconomic status (SES) impacts on both structural and functional brain development in childhood, but how early its effects can be demonstrated is unknown. In this study we measured resting baseline EEG activity in the gamma frequency range in awake 6–9‐month‐olds from areas of East London with high socioeconomic deprivation. Between‐subject comparisons of infants from low‐ and high‐income families revealed significantly lower frontal gamma power in infants from low‐income homes. Similar power differences were found when comparing infants according to maternal occupation, with lower occupational status groups yielding lower power. Infant sleep, maternal education, length of gestation, and birth weight, as well as smoke exposure and bilingualism, did not explain these differences. Our results show that the effects of socioeconomic disparities on brain activity can already be detected in early infancy, potentially pointing to very early risk for language and attention difficulties. This is the first study to reveal region‐selective differences in functional brain development associated with early infancy in low‐income families.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common childbirth complication, which can have negative effects on both the newly delivered woman and her family. This condition is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated, while a biological diagnostic test is not yet available. Furthermore, postpartum thyroid dysfunction is common among new mothers, and some evidence point to an association between PPD and thyroid function disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between serum levels of thyroid hormones at the time of delivery, and the later development of depressive symptoms, using data from a population based cohort of Swedish women. Blood samples were collected during delivery from 347 participating women, delivering at Uppsala University Hospital. The participating women filled in at least one of three structured questionnaires, containing the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), at five days, six weeks and six months postpartum. A cut-off of 12 or more was applied on the EPDS, to identify cases of self-reported PPD and controls. Using a binary logistic regression model (adjusting for previous psychiatric contact, smoking during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and sleep), having a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level over the clinical cut-off level of 4.0 mU/L was associated with increased risk for depressive symptoms at six months postpartum (OR 11.30, 95% CI 1.93-66.11). A ROC analysis revealed that the predictive variable (PV) had significant predictive ability for PPD at 6 months postpartum, given that the AUC was 0.764, and at a PV cut-off value of 6.33, the sensitivity and specificity were 76.2% and 69.4%, respectively. If these findings are replicated in future studies, they can have important clinical implications, since TSH determination is an inexpensive routine blood test, and its inclusion in a biological screening test for PPD involving other parameters would be tempting.

TI  - Inflammatory cytokines and neurological and neurocognitive alterations in the course of schizophrenia.
AU  - Fineberg, Anna M.
AU  - Ellman, Lauren M.
T2  - Biological Psychiatry
AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that immune alterations, especially those related to inflammation, are associated with increased risk of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related brain alterations. Much of this work has focused on the prenatal period, because infections during pregnancy have been repeatedly (albeit inconsistently) linked to risk of schizophrenia. Given that most infections do not cross the placenta, cytokines associated with inflammation (proinflammatory cytokines) have been targeted as potential mediators of the damaging effects of infection on the fetal brain in prenatal studies. Moreover, additional evidence from both human and animal studies suggests links between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, immune-related genes, and schizophrenia as well as brain alterations associated with the disorder. Additional support for the role of altered immune factors in the etiology of schizophrenia comes from neuroimaging studies, which have linked proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms with some of the structural and functional abnormalities repeatedly found in schizophrenia. These findings are reviewed and discussed with a life course perspective, examining the contribution of inflammation from the fetal period to disorder presentation. Unexplored areas and future directions, such as the interplay between inflammation, genes, and individual-level environmental factors (e.g., stress, sleep, and nutrition), are also discussed.

AB  - Little is known about modifiable lifestyle factors beyond quitting smoking that could prevent preterm delivery (PTD,8 h vs. 7–8 h). When sleep and exercise variables were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85–0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 24 kg/m² (OR = 0.85; 95 % CI = 0.79–0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both preconceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the United States.

AB  - Background: Napping is highly prevalent in pregnant women, but the relation between nighttime sleep and daytime naps in pregnant women is poorly understood. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the temporal association of nighttime sleep quality and quantity with subsequent daytime naps and the temporal association of daytime naps with sleep quality and quantity the following night in women during the third trimester of pregnancy in Taiwan. Methods: Sleep was assessed in 80 Taiwanese nulliparous women aged 31.70 years (SD = 4.58 years) using actigraphy and diaries for 7 consecutive days. Subjective sleep quality was examined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multiple linear regressions with generalized estimating equations were used to examine the temporal associations of nighttime sleep and daytime naps. Results: All women napped sometime during the study week, and mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score was 6.6, indicating poor sleep quality. Fewer weekly work hours and shorter sleep duration the preceding night were associated with longer nap duration the next day. More work hours, longer nap duration, and more intense fatigue were associated with shorter sleep duration the following night. Discussion: Naps during pregnancy might indicate insufficient nighttime sleep, and longer daytime naps could compromise subsequent nighttime sleep. Further research is needed to determine if short sleep duration and longer daytime naps are associated with negative pregnancy outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated episodic and procedural memory retention in early and late pregnancy and whether memory retention was related to sleep disruption. Twenty-six women in the third trimester of pregnancy, 20 women in the first trimester of pregnancy, and 24 non-pregnant controls were administered a battery of verbal and visual episodic memory tasks and two procedural memory tasks before undergoing an overnight sleep study. Memory retention was assessed the following morning. Results indicated that as compared with controls, both pregnant groups had reduced retention in verbal episodic memory but were unimpaired on visual and procedural memory tasks. The pregnant women also demonstrated significant disruption of sleep patterns. Reduced verbal memory retention during pregnancy was not attributable to any measure of sleep; however, small correlations between some indices of sleep and memory do not allow full dismissal of the sleep-dependent memory consolidation hypothesis.

Mothers preferred results about sleep, fears, and anxieties during later pregnancy to benefit from reassurance that their experiences were shared. Women mostly intended to share results with their social networks. Organizational contacts increased dissemination of the women’s preferred information to nonstudy participants.

AB  - We have investigated if biological rhythms, which affect many physiological and pathological events, influence the time of birth. Two hundred and sixty-three cases who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of active labor and who delivered vaginally were enrolled in the study. Information about the age, gravidity, parity, gestational age on admission, and time of onset of labor and birth was registered. A Morningness– Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) was administered for determining the patients’ chronotypes and dividing them into a morning- or evening-type group. While 20 (35%) of the morning-types delivered between 18:00 and 24:00 h, only 11 (19%) of them delivered between 06:00 and 12:00 h. From the evening types, 6 (33%) delivered between 18:00 and 24:00 h and 3 (17%) between 06:00 and 12:00 h. We conclude that there was no statistically significant difference between the chronotypes in terms of delivery time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study compared self-reported sleep latency (SL) and total sleep time (TST) to objective measures on polysomnography (PSG) during pregnancy. Thirty-three women in the third trimester (T3) of pregnancy, 16 women in the first trimester (T1) of pregnancy, and 15 non-pregnant women underwent overnight PSG, and shortly after awakening reported their perceived SL and TST. Results showed that, on average, the T3 group slightly overestimated their TSTs, whereas the T1 and non-pregnant groups underestimated TSTs when compared with objective measurement. All groups overestimated SL, and perceived SL was closest to the first epoch of 10 min of uninterrupted sleep or the first epoch of slow-wave sleep, rather than the first epoch of sleep (the current definition used for diagnostic sleep studies). The wide variation in discrepancies between estimation and PSG measurement for both TST and SL shows that self-reports made by both pregnant and non-pregnant women tend to be unreliable, which has important implications both clinically and for the many studies based on self-reported sleep patterns in pregnancy.

AU  - Parrott, Andrew C.
T2  - Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews
AB  - Serotonergic neurotoxicity following MDMA is well-established in laboratory animals, and neuroimaging studies have found lower serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users. Serotonin is a modulator for many different psychobiological functions, and this review will summarize the evidence for equivalent functional deficits in recreational users. Declarative memory, prospective memory, and higher cognitive skills are often impaired. Neurocognitive deficits are associated with reduced SERT in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. EEG and ERP studies have shown localised reductions in brain activity during neurocognitive performance. Deficits in sleep, mood, vision, pain, psychomotor skill, tremor, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status, have also been demonstrated. The children of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy have developmental problems. These psychobiological deficits are wide-ranging, and occur in functions known to be modulated by serotonin. They are often related to lifetime dosage, with light users showing slight changes, and heavy users displaying more pronounced problems. In summary, abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users can show deficits in a wide range of biobehavioral functions with a serotonergic component. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the impact of moderate noise on the sleep of very early preterm infants (VPI). Methods: Observational study of 26 VPI of 26–31 weeks’ gestation, with prospective measurements of sound pressure level and concomitant video records. Sound peaks were identified and classified according to their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above background noise. Prechtl’s arousal states during sound peaks were assessed by two observers blinded to the purpose of the study. Changes in sleep/arousal states following sound peaks were compared with spontaneous changes during randomly selected periods without sound peaks. Results: We identified 598 isolated sound peaks (5 ≤ SNR < 10 decibel slow response A (dBA), n = 518; 10 ≤ SNR < 15 dBA, n = 80) during sleep. Awakenings were observed during 33.8% (95% CI, 24–43.7%) of exposures to sound peaks of 5–10 dBA SNR and 39.7% (95% CI, 26–53.3%) of exposures to sound peaks of SNR 10–15 dBA, but only 11.7% (95% CI, 6.2–17.1%) of control periods. The proportions of awakenings following sound peaks were higher than the proportions of arousals during control periods (p < 0.005). Conclusions: Moderate acoustic changes can disrupt the sleep of VPI, and efficient sound abatement measures are needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Sleep duration and disorders in pregnancy: Implications for glucose metabolism and pregnancy outcomes.
AU  - O'Keeffe, M.
AU  - St-Onge, M.-P.
T2  - International Journal of Obesity
AB  - Humans have an innate requirement for sleep that is intrinsically governed by circadian and endocrine systems. More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Gestational hypertension (GH) is a newly recognized risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events later in life. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Recent research has suggested that women with GH may have an increased rate of SDB during pregnancy, but it is not known if this higher rate of SDB persists into the postpartum state. Objective: To assess whether women with GH continue to have an increased rate of SDB compared to healthy pregnant women, after the physiologic changes of pregnancy resolve. Methods: We previously studied women with GH and uncomplicated pregnancies with sleep questionnaires and level 1 polysomnography. Participants were invited to participate in repeat testing 1-2 years postpartum. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) differences were assessed. Results: Eighteen subjects (11 GH and 7 healthy) had complete follow-up data available for comparison with antepartum data. This group was representative of the initial antepartum cohort. Women with GH experienced a decrease in mean RDI from antepartum to postpartum (12.0 ± 12.3 vs 2.9 ± 2.9; P = 0.02). Healthy women did not experience the same change (2.8 ± 5.3 vs 2.1 ± 3.2; P = 0.81). Postpartum comparisons showed the mean RDI of women with GH had decreased to be similar to that of healthy women (P = 0.75). Conclusions: SDB in women with gestational hypertension improved in the postpartum state to levels indistinguishable from our healthy subjects. This suggests that the physiologic effects of pregnancy may have had a pathologic role in the development of antepartum SDB in women with GH.

AB  - Somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite changes, and sleep disruption) are common to both pregnancy and depression. The goal of the present study was to examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820 women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy. When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is reported commonly during pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but the majority of these data are based upon self-report measures not validated for pregnancy. This study examined the predictive value of screening questionnaires for SDB administered at two time-points in pregnancy, and attempted to develop an ‘optimized predictive model’ for detecting SDB in pregnancy. A total of 380 women were recruited from an antenatal clinic in the second trimester of pregnancy. All participants completed the Berlin Questionnaire and the Multivariable Apnea Risk Index (MAP Index) at recruitment, with a subset of 43 women repeating the questionnaires at the time of polysomnography at 37 weeks’ gestation. Fifteen of 43 (35%) women were confirmed to have a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > 5 h−1. Prediction of an RDI > 5 h−1 was most accurate during the second trimester for both the Berlin Questionnaire (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.50, positive predictive value 0.50 and negative predictive value 0.93), and the MAP Index [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.768]. A stepwise selection model identified snoring volume, a body mass index (BMI) ≥32 kg m−2 and tiredness upon awakening as the strongest independent predictors of SDB during pregnancy; this model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.952. We conclude that existing clinical prediction models for SDB perform inadequately as a screening tool in pregnancy. The development of a highly predictive model from our data shows promise for a quick and easy screening tool to be validated for future use in pregnancy.

TI  - Human psychobiology of MDMA or ‘ecstasy’: An overview of 25 years of empirical research.
AU  - Parrott, Andrew C.
T2  - Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical and Experimental
AB  - Aims: This paper aimed to review how scientific knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA has developed over time. Methods: In this paper, the empirical findings from earlier and later studies will be reviewed. Results: When MDMA was a ‘novel psychoactive substance’, it was not seen as a drug of abuse, as it displayed loss of efficacy. However, recreational users display a unique pattern of increasing doses, deteriorating cost–benefit ratios, and voluntary cessation. MDMA increases body temperature and thermal stress, with cortisol levels increased by 800% in dance clubbers. It can be extremely euphoric, although negative moods are also intensified. MDMA causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been investigated for cancer therapy because of its anti-lymphoma properties. Recreational users show deficits in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, problem solving, and social intelligence. Basic cognitive skills remain intact. Neuroimaging studies show reduced serotonin transporter levels across the cerebral cortex, which are associated with neurocognitive impairments. Deficits also occur in sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, complex vision, pain, neurohormones, and psychiatric status. Ecstasy/MDMA use during pregnancy leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Conclusions: The damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA are far more widespread than was realized a few years ago, with new neuropsychobiological deficits still emerging.

AB  - There is evidence for the reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillation and reproduction, and disruption of circadian rhythms has been associated with impaired menstrual functions and reduced fertility in women. However, only little information is available on the relationship between reproduction and chronotype. The aim of the present study is to better assess this relationship. The participants (aged 25 to 74 yrs) were selected randomly from the Finnish Population Information System. The data from 2672 female participants of the National FINRISK Survey 2007 were analyzed to test the associations between chronotype (morning, intermediate, or evening) and reproductive features. Of the participants, 139 (5.6%) were evening, 1217 (48.7%) intermediate, and 1145 (45.8%) morning chronotypes. Among the participants aged 25 to 54 yrs, the duration of menstrual cycle was longer among evening chronotypes (28.8 4.4 d) than among morning (27.7 ± 2.6 d; p  0.01) and intermediate (27.8 ± 3.3 d; p = 0.05) chronotypes. Significant correlations were found between the higher morningness-eveningness scores (the more of morning chronotype) and the shorter durations of menstrual bleeding, both in the whole sample (p  0.001) and after limiting the analyses to women younger than 55 yrs (p  0.05). In multivariable analyses on the whole sample, as compared with morning chronotypes, intermediate chronotypes had a significantly longer duration of menstrual bleeding (B = 0.160, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.044 to 0.276; p p  0.01). Our findings suggest that chronotype is related to the reproductive function in women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a substantial risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman’s ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4–15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score ≤ 9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years ± 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean prepregnancy BMI 30 kg/m² ± 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored ≤ 9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).

TI  - Management of psychiatric illness in pregnancy in the emergency department.
AU  - Anderson, Eric L.
T2  - Behavioral emergencies for the emergency physician.
AB  - For many psychiatric illnesses, the onset of symptoms begins during the late teens to the early thirties. This is especially concerning in women as it coincides with the childbearing years. Pregnancy was once thought to be protective from psychiatric illness. However, as the recent explosion of literature addressing the safety of psychotropic agents in pregnancy illustrates, the puerperal period is not exempt from mental illness. The presence of mental illness in pregnancy is associated with poor compliance with prenatal care; increased tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substance use; inadequate maternal nutrition; poor mother-infant bonding; and disruption of the home environment. While the diagnostic criteria are the same as in nonpregnant patients, many symptoms common in mental illness, such as fatigue, low energy, and disrupted sleep, are also normal for pregnancy. Medication treatment is a controversial issue: in the case of the pregnant patient, there are at least two (or more!) patients, mother and unborn child, and many of the treatments available to address mental illness can potentially harm the fetus. This chapter will present the major mental health topics of concern in pregnant patients and offer guidelines in the management of these patients in the emergency setting.

AB  - Study Objective: This cohort study examined the impact of maternal snoring on key delivery outcomes such as mode of delivery, infant birth centile, and small-for-gestational age. Design: Cohort study. Setting: A large tertiary medical center. Patients or Participants: Pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010. Measurements and Results: Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-for-gestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mental health is an important medical issue in perinatal care, and there is increasing evidence that insomnia during pregnancy is associated with postpartum depression (PPD). Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of insomnia treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy on PPD symptoms. Fifty-four pregnant women with insomnia were randomly assigned to trazodone, diphenhydramine, or placebo treatment. Sleep quality was measured by actigraphy at baseline, and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, depression was assessed 2 and 6 weeks after delivery. Trazodone and diphenhydramine improved sleep profile compared to placebo after 6 weeks of treatment. Further, depressive symptoms were reduced 2 and 6 weeks after delivery in trazodone and diphenhydramine groups compared to placebo. No differences in depressive symptoms were observed between the trazodone and diphenhydramine groups. These findings indicate that insomnia treatment with trazodone or diphenhydramine during the third trimester of pregnancy may prevent PPD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sleep disorders, prevalent in industrialized countries, are associated with adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose, depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well‐being. This focused review of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep disorders of interest: breathing‐related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies.

These studies have led to important new insights about the relation between functional brain development and behavior. However, special consideration is warranted when working with adolescents. In this review, we review variables, including pubertal stage, sleep patterns and pregnancy, which are particularly relevant for developmental cognitive neuroscience studies involving adolescents. Consideration of the unique challenges associated with adolescence will help the growing field of developmental neuroimaging standardize procedures and will eventually facilitate interpretation across studies.

AB  - This chapter discusses Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome and its management in premenopausal women. Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent sleep-induced collapsibility of the pharyngeal airway. Normal adult women (ages 20-45 years) are a cohort of women in whom menstrual cycles, the use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and lactation are associated with a varied hormonal environment. These differences in the hormonal status may in turn potentially change the likelihood for the development of OSAHS in premenopausal women. The clinical spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing includes apnea, hypopneas, and upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by L. M. Glynn (see record 2012-27387-005). Glynn presented a controlled, large-sample longitudinal study to assess verbal memory performances in primiparous (PRIM) and multiparous (MULT) women in different stages of pregnancy. The behavior examined was a paired-association learning task, which consists of recalling word-pair lists presented verbally. Glynn's results showed that PRIMs outperformed MULTs across gestation and that a cumulative effect of multiple pregnancies was associated with poor performance in the last weeks of pregnancy. Further examinations of diverse forms of maternal memory or of adult reproduction-related developmental offspring-relevant tasks are required to comprehensively address the wholesale renovation of the female brain into the maternal brain. The current authors conclude that Glynn’s article is a very good start, and it raises many questions worth following up in humans, other mammals, and additional postreproduction models.

AB  - Presents a case report of a 34-year-old married, requested urgent evaluation in the 10th week of a wanted pregnancy. From the fourth week of gestation, she had suffered from intractable vomiting and severe anxiety with bouts of tearfulness she found frightening. The patient was anhedonic and unable to focus on work. She also reported awakening earlier than normal and diurnal mood variation, with mornings being her worst time. She had no history of hallucinations or delusions or periods of discreet mood elevation. She denied current substance use. this patient’s anhedonia, diurnal variation, sleep disorder, and agitation suggested either a severe but unspecified anxiety disorder, or depression with melancholic features. Research suggests that genetically based individual sensitivity to normal hormonal variation contributes to psychiatric disorders that arise during pregnancy.

AB  - Across the life cycle of women, the quality and quantity of sleep can be markedly impacted by both internal (e.g., hormonal changes and vasomotor symptoms) and external (financial, marital, and child care responsibilities) factors. This chapter will outline some of the major phases of the adult life cycle in women that have been associated with sleep problems. The main messages from this chapter include that sleep disturbance and sleep disorders are common in women and increase across the lifespan for a variety of reasons; once identified, the sleep problem is generally best addressed by the standard therapeutic approach, although special cases arise in pregnant and lactating women due to concern for the fetus and child; and little systematic, large-scale research has been performed in virtually every area reviewed. This chapter is organized into sections that address sleep problems associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, and the perimenopause.

AB  - Sleep disorders affect people at all stages of life. For women, sleep complaints may vary by hormonal status as well as life stage. Certain broad perceptions about sleep and sleep disorders are supported by population surveys. In earlier research, most study populations that included women did not differentiate findings by gender. Even in studies of women with sleep disorders, the potential effects of hormonal condition or reproductive status were not identified. These topics have been more frequently addressed in recent years. Women develop more sleep problems during pregnancy and with menopause. Postmenopausal and elderly woman have more insomnia complaints while sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) increases in the peri- and postmenopausal population. This chapter provides an introduction to recent findings on sleep and women from menarche to menopause. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This chapter reviews restless leg syndrome and its management, particularly as found in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS), commonly affects women and can significantly affect sleep and quality of life. The etiology of the disorder is multifactorial, but in women it may be influenced by higher rates of anemia and sex hormone levels. Treatment includes correction of iron deficiency, if present, and both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. Current first-line agents include the non-ergotamine dopamine agonists, ropinerole and pramipexole. The use of these agents in women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should be carefully considered due to potential risks to the fetus.

AB  - Gestational restless legs syndrome (gRLS) is a common and often unrecognized symptom constellation that produces discomfort, sleep fragmentation, and daytime somnolence. The etiology of gRLS remains undetermined. When discovered, other conditions that can produce gRLS should be investigated, including diabetes, iron deficiency, hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, and neuropathy. A number of pharmacologic therapies are available, though their use in pregnancy poses many obstacles. Iron and folate supplementation should be implemented. A review of concurrent medications and limiting agents that may exaggerate RLS can often produce improvement. Non-pharmacological strategies are the mainstay of treatment. Although most women will have resolution of RLS symptoms in the weeks immediately prior to or following birth, there is an increased risk of symptom recurrence with future pregnancies or later in life.

AB  - Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by nocturnal symptoms of difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep, and by daytime symptoms that impair occupational, social, or other areas of functioning. Insomnia disorder can exist alone or in conjunction with comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions. The incidence of insomnia is higher in women and can increase during certain junctures of a woman’s life (e.g., pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause). This article will focus on an overview of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, evidence of effectiveness for this treatment when insomnia disorder is experienced alone or in parallel with a comorbidity, and a review with promising data on the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia when present during postpartum and menopause.

AB  - Sleep dysfunction is one of the primary symptoms reported by patients with psychiatric disorders, specifically those suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders. Conversely, primary insomnia and other sleep dysfunctions produce symptoms of mood disturbance that are similar to those reported by patients with psychiatric disorders. Because of this overlap in the symptoms and treatments for insomnias and psychiatric disorders, it is important for clinicians to be able to accurately identify the root cause of sleep dysfunction in individual patients in order to optimize treatment. Part of the Oxford Psychiatry Library series, Sleep Disorders, Second Edition provides clinicians with an overview of the current understanding of sleep physiology, the pathophysiology of sleep disturbance, and the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. This second edition includes new sections covering sleep problems in children and the elderly, sleep in pregnancy and menopause, and new algorithms from the British Association of Psychopharmacology's (BAP's) new Consensus Guidelines on the management of sleep disorders.

AB  - Purpose: To describe trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents and to identify early indicators of these trajectories using data from routine well-child assessments at ages 0–4 years. Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11–17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0–4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories. Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43). Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments.

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Background: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n−3) is highly important during pregnancy for optimal development and functioning of fetal neural tissue. Infant ability to organize sleep and wake states following parturition is highly associated with later developmental outcomes. The impact of maternal DHA intake on sleep organization has not been previously investigated. Aims: To examine the effect of a DHA-containing functional food consumed during pregnancy on early neurobehavioral development as assessed by infant sleep patterning in the first 48 postnatal hours. Study design: A longitudinal, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design was used. Subjects: Women (18–35 y) with no pregnancy complications consumed a cereal-based functional food (92 kcal) containing 300 mg DHA an average of 5 d/week or placebo bars (n = 27 DHA, n = 21 Placebo). The intervention began at 24 weeks gestation and continued until delivery (38–40 weeks). Outcome measures: Infant sleep/wake states were measured on postnatal days 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) using a pressure sensitive mattress recording respiration and body movements. Results: Using ANCOVA and controlling for ethnic variation, there were significant group differences in arousals in quiet sleep on D1 (P = 0.006) and D2 (P = 0.011) with fewer arousals in the DHA intervention group compared to the placebo group. Similarly, arousals in active sleep on D1 were significantly lower in the DHA-intervention group (P = 0.012) compared to the placebo group. Conclusions: We conclude that increased prenatal supply of dietary DHA has a beneficial impact on infant sleep organization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Clinical Nursing
AB  - Aims and objectives: To explore the impact of delivery mode on women’s postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background: Childbirth significantly affects puerpera’s physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design: Cross-sectional study design. Methods: Women residing in rural areas and in their 0–12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women’s socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results: The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions: Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice: Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To describe the physical and social environment of sleep self-management in postpartum socioeconomically disadvantaged women. Design: Descriptive, exploratory design. Setting: Participants were recruited in the hospital after giving birth. Data were collected in participant homes after discharge. Participants: Postpartum women on Medicaid with normal healthy infants. Methods: Participants completed a survey about features within their physical and social sleep environment at 2 weeks postpartum. Participants then completed 3 days and nights of sleep diaries at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum to document perceived awakenings, select sleep hygiene practices, bed sharing, and reasons for sleep disruption. Results: The sleep environments of participants were dynamic from night to night. Bed sharing was common with nearly one half of participants sharing with a partner, approximately 25% with the infant, and 20% with older children. Fifty-two percent of participants slept with the television on part (31%) or all (69%) of the night. Eighty-five percent of participants drank caffeine and 24% smoked. Conclusions: These results inform theory-driven postpartum sleep interventions. Modifications to the physical and social sleep environment that attend specifically to how sleep hygiene and environmental factors are manifested in the postpartum period have the potential to improve sleep for socioeconomically disadvantaged women. Future research is needed to articulate which changes can be effectively self-managed by mothers through nursing interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Circadian rhythm disorders represent an important component underlying the pathology of depression. One of the subtypes of depression, in which these disorders may play a crucial role, is the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The bright light therapy (BLT) has been reported as a novel, promising treatment method for SAD since 1984, and most of the data revealing its efficacy has been referred to adult patients, without comorbid disorders. However, in the recent years, more and more reports have been presented, which confirm the usefulness of BLT in some specific subpopulations of patients, including children, adolescents and pregnant women. The present review summarizes the applications of BLT in antepartum depression, childhood and adolescence depression as well as in patients suffering from eating disorders. Although the body of evidence is still too small to recommend the use of BLT as the first line of treatment for the depression or eating disorders in these patient subpopulations; it appears that BLT may be a useful alternative or adjunctive therapy for these diseases. However, the specific clinical applications of BLT in these areas need further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A population-based questionnaire study of 2,816 women was conducted in week 32 of pregnancy to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for insomnia and depressive symptoms. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) measured insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) measured depressive symptoms. The prevalence of insomnia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) was 61.9%, and mean BIS score 17.5 (SD = 10.5), significantly higher than among the general population. The prevalence of depressive symptoms (EPDS ≥ 10) was 14.6%. Depressive symptoms were strongly associated with insomnia during late pregnancy, especially with sleep durations10 hours, sleep efficiency <75%, daytime impairment, and long sleep onset latency. Pelvic girdle pain and lower back pain was associated with insomnia, but not with depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Hancox, Robert J.
AU  - Landhuis, C. Erik
T2  - Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health
AB  - Background: Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that inadequate sleep can cause both obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Short sleep duration in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Methods: An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA1c levels were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were excluded from the analyses. Results: Childhood sleep duration did not predict adult HbA1c. However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with higher levels of HbA1c (p = 0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes (p = 0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA1c was independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. Conclusions: Short sleep duration is associated with higher levels of HbA1c and an increased risk of prediabetes in young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.

AB  - This study assessed the links between maternal sleep and mothers’ perceptions of their attachment relationship with their infant among women at risk for postpartum depression by virtue of having been depressed during pregnancy. Sixty-two mothers completed sleep diaries and questionnaires at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Regression analyses, controlling for depression severity and infant temperament, revealed significant prospective correlation between maternal shorter total sleep time at 3 months and lower scores on a mother–infant attachment questionnaire at 6 months. At 6 months, the longer time mothers were awake tending to their infants the lower were their attachment scores. The findings suggest that improving sleep of mothers who suffered from prenatal depression may have a positive effect on mothers’ self-reported relationship with their infants.

AB  - Objective: To assess characteristics of short sleepers and long sleepers and to assess association between sleep duration and central obesity in a population-based sample of women. Method: Non-pregnant women ⩾ 20 years that were randomly selected from the population-registry of Uppsala, Sweden, answered a questionnaire (n = 6461) including questions on sleeping habits and somatic disorders. Results: There was a U-shaped association between sleep duration and waist circumference. Short sleeping women (< 5h) had a waist circumference of 89.2 ± 14.9 cm (mean ± SD) decreasing to 82.9 ± 11.9 cm for women sleeping 7–< 8h and increasing to 89.0 ± 16.7cm for women sleeping ⩾ 10h. Both short sleepers and long sleepers were more often physically inactive, smokers, ill or taking medication, and psychologically distressed than normal sleepers (6– < 9h). In women < 50 years both short and long sleep duration were risk factors for central obesity. Short sleep duration remained a risk factor for central obesity, whereas the association with long sleep duration did not reach statistical significance after adjustments. Conclusions: Short sleepers and long sleepers showed differences in characteristics compared to normal sleepers. Furthermore, we showed an independent association between short sleep duration and central obesity, which was strongest in younger women. It is important to identify short sleepers, especially in younger women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Factors associated with bed-sharing within racial groups in a sample of mothers and young infants in Wisconsin.
AU  - Salm Ward, Trina C.
AB  - Since 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended a separate but proximate sleep surface for infants (AAP, 2005). However, racial differences in the prevalence of bed-sharing and infant mortality (especially as a result of SIDS or unsafe sleep) continue. Limited research has examined predictors of bed-sharing by racial group, especially the AAP's 2005 policy statement against it. The purpose of this study was to explore maternal-infant bed-sharing and infant sleep position for African-Americans and Whites in a sample of 2,530 respondents (822 African-American and 1,708 Whites) to the Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (PRAMS), a stratified sample of linked survey and birth certificate data between 2007 and 2010. Significantly more African-Americans (70.5%) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.5%), z = 56.67, SEM = 0.005, p < .001 (one-tailed). Factors associated with bed-sharing varied by race. In the final models, for African-Americans, a higher likelihood of bed-sharing was associated with ≥ 16 years of education (Odds Ratio[OR]: 2.540, 95% CI: 1.098-5.875), 13-15 years of education (OR: 1.924, 95% CI: 1.129-3.278), partner-related stress (OR: 1.859, 95% CI: 1.272-2.715), currently breastfeeding (OR: 1.598, 95% CI: 1.012-2.522), non-supine infant sleep (OR: 1.573, 95% CI: 1.077-2.297), and maternal age (OR: 0.963, 95% CI: 0.931-0.995). When Medicaid as method of payment was included, it reduced the likelihood of bed-sharing (OR: 0.550, 95% CI: 0.372-0.814). For Whites, bed-sharing was associated with currently breastfeeding (OR: 2.444, 95% CI: 1.939-3.081), income of $10,000-$14,999 (OR: 1.833, 95% CI: 1.004-3.344), income of $35,000-$49,999 (OR: 1.704, 95% CI: 1.234-2.351), being unmarried (OR: 1.667, 95% CI: 1.184-2.346), non-supine infant sleep (OR: 1.407, 95% CI: 1.069-1.852), and partner-related stress (OR: 1.381, 95% CI: 1.058-1.802). Needing money for food was also associated with bed-sharing (OR: 1.575, 95% CI: 1.158-2.143). Overall, subtle differences in the factors at play for African-American and White families who bed-share were demonstrated. Practice implications include culturally-relevant discussions and interventions. In-depth investigation of the family level context of bed-sharing, the ecology of infant sleep, and information received by families is suggested. These results help inform development of a targeted, culturally sensitive approach to educating families on sleep-related infant safety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Characterization of normal development and injury in the premature baboon brain.
AU  - Griffith, Jennifer Lynn
AB  - Nearly 13% of infants born in the United States each year are preterm—that is, born before 37 weeks gestation. Although improvements in clinical care have contributed to survival rates that now exceed 85%, premature infants are at high risk for motor, sensory, cognitive and behavioral disabilities. In order to develop therapeutic interventions to prevent these adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, we must first understand the nature of cerebral injury associated with premature birth and the mechanisms by which it leads to altered brain development. A baboon (Papio papio) model of preterm birth was used to evaluate cerebral development from 90 days of gestation (dg) to term (∼ 185 dg). Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was obtained on fixed brains. In addition, histopathology was obtained. Analysis of this model led to the following conclusions. (1) MRI/DTI findings during brain maturation closely paralleled those from live premature infants, indicating that the preterm baboon is a good model of human development. (2) Both qualitative MRI scoring and quantitative analysis of DTI parameters correlated with pathologic abnormalities in cerebral white matter. In particular, reduced oligodendrocyte number was associated with increased radial diffusivity and decreased diffusion anisotropy, while astrocytosis corresponded to increased apparent diffusion coefficient. (3) The birth weight of control animals correlated strongly with cerebral development as measured with MRI/DTI, with lower weight corresponding to less mature brain. Since birth weight may be an indicator of the quality of the intrauterine environment, it may better predict cerebral growth and maturation than gestational age. (4) Clinical therapies differentially affect cerebral development and provide opportunities for neuroprotection. Positive pressure and high frequency ventilation were associated with more cerebral injury (as measured using both histology and MRI/DTI) than nasal continuous positive airway pressure. (5) High-dose erythropoietin, a novel neuroprotective agent, had no adverse effects on cerebral development and may increase the potential for cerebral repair by inducing proliferation of cells in the subventricular zone.

T2  - Sleep and Biological Rhythms
AB  - The current literature suggests that nighttime sleep is compromised during late pregnancy and early postpartum periods, but little is known about the 24-hour sleep pattern during this time. This study aims to first, explore the day-to-day changes in the quantity and quality of objectively measured sleep during the week immediately before and after the day of delivery, and second, to provide descriptive data on timing of naps during late pregnancy and the first week postpartum. Twenty-four healthy women completed one week of actigraphy assessment during the third trimester, and six days before and after delivery. Demographic and obstetric information was collected via questionnaires. Nighttime sleep was significantly disrupted and shortened immediately after giving birth, while napping behavior significantly increased. Total sleep time across 24 hours, however, remained stable due to increased napping behaviors. Across the first postpartum week, nighttime sleep improved linearly, with its quantity, but not quality, comparable to that of the third trimester on the sixth postpartum day. Napping behavior decreased linearly during the first postpartum week, although participants continued to take more naps on the sixth postpartum day than during the third trimester. During antenatal periods, naps were most likely to occur during early afternoon, while during the first postpartum week, naps were evenly distributed across late morning to early evening. These findings suggest that sleep is redistributed across 24-hour periods during immediate postpartum, and this redistribution raises questions on the restorative value of sleep women obtain after giving birth.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of educational and psychological factors on academic achievements of the secondary school students in Esfahan. The design of this study was descriptive and correlational. The samples of this study were secondary school students in five education districts of Esfahan including 360 students selected by multistage random sampling. Baumrinds parenting style questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and a demographic questionnaire were used for collecting data. Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis and test were used for data analysis. Findings showed that physical symptoms (p < 0/01), anxiety sleep disturbance (p < 0/01), impairment in social interaction (p < 0/01), major depression (p < 0/01), mental health (p < 0/01), and academic achievement had significant relationship. The permissive approach to child rearing and academic achievement of students have no significant relationship (p < 0/05). The authoritarian and authoritative parenting styles were significantly related to students achievements (p < 0/01). Mental health components and methods of child rearing and education of fathers and mothers were not significantly different (p < 0/05). The difference was significant among the different groups in terms of mental health components and methods of child bearing (p < 0/05). Mental health components and methods of child bearing between girls and boys were significant only in the authoritarian parenting style. Regression analysis showed that the methods of parenting and mental health variables predict academic achievements of secondary school students (R = 0/603 and P = 0/001).

AB  - Study Objectives: We compared sleep problems during pregnancy and sleep dissatisfaction 18 months after pregnancy in pregnant women with binge eating disorder (BED) symptoms and pregnant women without an eating disorder. Design: Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Patients or Participants: Data were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent). Measurements and Results: Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth. All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester, women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01). Conclusions: BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth. Health care professionals should inquire about BED during pregnancy as it may be associated with sleep disturbances, in addition to the hallmark eating concerns.

AB  - Dopamine agonists are commonly used in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, Parkinson’s disease, and restless leg syndrome. While generally well tolerated, these agents can cause psychiatric adverse side effects including depression, somnolence, anorexia, anxiety, insomnia, impaired concentration, nervousness, hallucinations, nightmares, psychosis, and mania. Here we present a case of a cabergoline-associated manic episode. Ms. C, a 45-year-old woman, was evaluated 8 months prior to presentation for a 2-year history of amenorrhea. Ms. C was not sexually active, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had never been pregnant. Three days prior to presentation, Ms. C was noted to have increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and to be planning overly-ambitious projects. On the day of presentation, she reported racing thoughts, stated that she was on a divine mission and began intruding into ongoing classes to recruit students to join her. This case suggests a possible adverse drug reaction. Although the circumstances of her case suggest that cabergoline may have contributed to the precipitation of her mania, Ms. C has not been re-challenged with cabergoline, so causality cannot be proven. In conclusion, while cabergoline is generally a safe and effective method of reducing prolactin levels, it is associated with psychiatric side effects, including mania. Physicians should carefully screen patients for a personal as well as family history of psychiatric illness before initiating therapy. At-risk patients may benefit from more frequent monitoring and cessation of therapy at the earliest safe juncture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Taiwanese women. Methods: We enrolled 461 pregnant women (18–45 years) admitted at Mackay Memorial Hospital for delivery from September 2010 to May 2011. The face-to-face questionnaire used to gather data included assessment of RLS diagnostic criteria, and questions related to RLS. Results: The overall prevalence rate of RLS among the study participants was 10.4%; 2.8% were categorized as having chronic RLS. Participants without RLS reported higher folate and iron supplement consumption than those with RLS. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations of RLS with anemia and peptic ulcer disease. Participants with transient RLS during pregnancy reported more regular coffee consumption before pregnancy, and better sleep latency, duration, and efficiency, than those with chronic RLS. Overall, 81.2% of RLS sufferers reported sleep disturbances. Conclusions: Our study revealed highly prevalent but poorly recognized RLS among Taiwanese pregnant women. The identification of predictors such as medical comorbidities, and protectors such as folate and iron supplements, is warranted for obstetric RLS. In most cases, symptoms began during the second or third trimester and resolved within a week after delivery. Restricted coffee consumption before pregnancy is encouraged, but further evidence is needed to support this recommendation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Women's Health
AB  - Background: The purpose of this investigation was to determine if reproductive experience is associated with cumulative effects on human memory performance during pregnancy and if these effects persist into the postpartum period. Methods: Verbal recall memory performance was assessed in 254 women four times during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The relation between parity and memory function was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The data indicate that the previously documented adverse effects of pregnancy on memory performance are compounded with successive pregnancies. During gestation and postpartum, multiparity was associated with poorer memory function, and these effects did not appear to be due to differences in maternal demographics, depressive symptoms, or sleep quality. Conclusions: Animal models demonstrate that the effects of reproduction on brain structure and function are both cumulative and enduring. However, little is known about the influence of reproductive experience on the human female brain. These findings provide evidence that in humans, reproduction is associated with striking and perhaps persisting changes in cognitive function.

T2  - Sleep Medicine Reviews
AB  - Sleep is an essential human behavior that shows prominent gender differences. Disturbed sleep, in particular, is much more prevalent in females than males. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) as one cause of disturbed sleep was observed to be somewhat more common among women than men in Ekbom's 1945 seminal series of clinical cases with the disease. He, however, reported this gender difference mainly for those with more severe symptoms. Since then numerous studies have reported that women are affected by RLS about twice as often as males for mild as well as moderate to severe RLS. The present review focuses on RLS in females from the perspectives of both epidemiology and pathophysiology. RLS will generally become worse or might appear for the first time during pregnancy. Parity increases the risk of RLS later in life suggesting that pregnancy is a specific behavioral risk factor for developing RLS. Some evidence suggests that dysfunction in iron metabolism and high estrogen levels might contribute to RLS during pregnancy. But, menopause does not lower the incidence of RLS nor does hormone replacement therapy lead to an increase, suggesting a quite complex uncertain role of hormones in the pathophysiology of RLS. Therefore, further, preferably longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the factors causing RLS in women. These studies should include genetic, clinical and polysomnographic variables, as well as hormonal measures and variables assessing iron metabolism.

It takes a life course approach which includes genetics, pre-conception, pregnancy, infancy and childhood. The paper focuses on feeding behaviours, physical activity, parental influences and the wider social and environmental context. Risk factors which can cumulatively lead to excess childhood weight gain include: under- or overweight during pregnancy; the presence of diabetes during pregnancy; low or high birth weight; having obese parents; early weaning; prolonged formula feeding; rapid weight gain in the first year; disinhibited eating patterns and the consistent availability of energy dense food at home; feeding practices which are not responsive to the child’s cues; insufficient sleep among preschool children; sedentary parents; low parental education; living in poor socio-economic circumstances; absence, or perceived absence, of safe play areas; parents who lack time or confidence to authoritatively parent; environments where there is poor access to affordable lower energy dense foods; and parents who do not accept that excess weight is a health problem. Recommendations for health professionals are made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Our research aimed to build on this idea of a comparative focus, by exploring maternal ideas and behavior about infant sleep, about falling asleep and awakening, in two different Italian towns of northern and southern Italy. In doing so, we wished to evaluate if there were differences in two cultural contexts of the same country. Two different towns, Ferrara in the north of Italy and Cosenza in the south, separated by a distance of some 1000 miles, were identified as quite contrasting Italian cultural settings. These towns express different cultural backgrounds related to their different economic, historical, and social traditions. We hypothesized that the two towns might express different cultural patterns of infant care. The timing of the questionnaires was chosen with different aims. Interview One, which was administered to pregnant women a few days before delivery of their child, was intended to check maternal ideas at a time when ideas about the infants and their sleep are more socially rooted, not yet negotiated through the experience of interacting with, and knowing their own infants, and their sleep. Interview Two, given to mothers of one-month-old infants, was addressed to mothers whose ideas and concerns might have been influenced by their relationship with the infant. Our first hypothesis was that the two groups of mothers would have different ideas about infants falling asleep and about their awakenings. Our second hypothesis was that the two groups of mothers would use different practices for inducing sleep; that the Ferrara mothers (in the north of Italy) would be more "distal" oriented, whereas the mothers of Cosenza (in the south of Italy) would be more "proximal" oriented. Our third hypothesis was that even over the short period of one month, we would see some changes occurring between the ideas and practices expressed in the first questionnaire and those expressed in the second.

AB  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) is associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as increased motor activity and elevated anxiety, that may last a lifetime. Persistent sleep disruption may underlie these problems. Using a rat model, we investigated long-term alterations of sleep–wake behavior following AE during a critical early developmental period. Male rats received 2.6 g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD) 4–9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group), or were sham-intubated (S group). On PD52–80, they were instrumented for tethered electroencephalogram and nuchal electromyogram recording and habituated to the recording procedures. Sleep–wake behavior was then recorded during one 24 h-long session. Wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) were scored in 10 s epochs during 6 h of the lights-on (rest) and 6 h of the lights-off (active) periods. During the active period, REMS percentage was significantly lower (4.7 ± 0.9 (SE) vs. 8.2 ± 0.9; p p = 0.07) in AE than S rats (N = 6/group). During the rest period, sleep and wake amounts did not differ between the groups, but AE rats had longer latency to both SWS and REMS onset (p = 0.02 and 0.003, respectively). Our data demonstrate that, in a rat model of prenatal AE, impaired sleep–wake behavior persists into the adulthood. Disordered sleep may exacerbate cognitive and behavioral disorders seen in human victims of prenatal AE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a non-pregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in brain regions known to regulate the sleep/wake cycle and body temperature might reflect altered rhythms in these overt functions. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS in early pregnant and diestrous rats in the medial septum (MS), vertical and horizontal diagonal bands of Broca (VDB and HDB), perifornical lateral hypothalamus (LH), and ventrolateral, medial, and median preoptic areas (VLPO, MPA, and MnPO, respectively). In the pregnant animals, FOS expression was reduced and the daily rhythms of expression were lost or attenuated in the MS, VDB, and LH, areas known to support wakefulness, and in the MPA, a brain region that may coordinate sleep/wake patterns with temperature changes. However, despite the well-documented differences in sleep patterns between diestrous and pregnant rats, reproductive state did not affect FOS expression in the VLPO or MnPO, two brain regions in which FOS expression usually correlates with sleep. These data indicate that plasticity in sleep/wake patterns during early pregnancy may be driven by a reduction in wakefulness-promotion by the brain, rather than by an increase in sleep drive.

TI  - The influence of steroid and peptide hormones on cognition and mood during late pregnancy and early postpartum.
AU  - Henry, Jessica F.
AB  - Cognitive and mood changes during pregnancy and postpartum have been subjectively reported by women and have also been objectively measured. However, evidence relating to the relationship between hormone levels and these changes is sparse and contradictory. The studies presented in this thesis were undertaken to investigate the possible influence of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), testosterone (T), cortisol (CORT) and prolactin (PRL) levels on cognitive functioning and mood during late pregnancy and the early postpartum period. In Study 1, pregnant women were tested on a battery of neuropsychological tests once during late pregnancy and once during the early postpartum period and their scores were compared to non-pregnant controls. Results showed that the pregnancy group had significantly lower scores than the controls on tasks of verbal recall and processing speed both during the pregnancy and the postpartum test times. CORT levels were significantly associated, in an inverted-U function, with verbal recall scores during pregnancy and postpartum and with spatial abilities at postpartum. During pregnancy, negative linear associations were observed between PRL and executive function and paragraph recall scores along with an inverted-U association with paragraph recall scores. At postpartum, E2 and CORT were negatively associated, in a linear fashion, with attention scores. In Study 2, linear and non-linear associations between hormones and mood during pregnancy and postpartum were investigated while taking into consideration psychosocial factors previously found to be related to mood changes during these reproductive periods. Perceived stress, social support from friends, social support from a significant other and sleep were found to be significant predictors of mood scores. During pregnancy, a small positive linear correlation was obtained between levels of PRL and lower mood scores. At the postpartum visit, moderate U-shaped correlations were found between mood disturbances and level of E2 and P while smaller increases in the Cortisol Awakening Response were associated with poorer mood. Collectively, the present studies provide new evidence that aspects of cognitive function and mood are altered during pregnancy and the postpartum periods and may be modulated, at least in part, by hormonal and psychosocial factors during these reproductive events.

AB  - Background: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was initially developed to measure daytime sleep propensity in patients affected by a variety of sleep disorders. Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS, although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been conducted with this population. Objective: The objective was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who received prenatal care was at Magee-Women’s Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that completed the ESS. Methods: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor solution. An overall Cronbach’s alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability (Factor 1α = .754; Factor 2α = .524). Both convergent and discriminant validity were established. Conclusion: The ESS is appropriate for use in an obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women.

AB  - Sleep disruption has been suggested to contribute to postpartum mood, but few studies have explored differences in this relationship between nulliparous and multiparous mothers. This study compared the interaction of sleep and mood as a function of parity. Thirty-five nulliparous and 34 multiparous mothers completed questionnaires on mood and sleep, and wore actigraphs for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within 2 weeks postpartum. Mood and objective sleep were better in multiparas than in nulliparas after delivery. However, other than a stronger association between subjective sleep and stress in nulliparous mothers, the relationship between sleep and mood did not differ significantly between the two groups. This suggests that parity might play only a limited role in the interaction between sleep and mood during the immediate postpartum period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To examine the continuity and discontinuity of trouble sleeping behaviors (TSB) from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood in a community-based prospective birth cohort study. Methods: The original study comprised 7223 mother–offspring pairs who were followed prospectively at pregnancy, 6 months, 5, 14 and 21 years post-delivery. Participant numbers differ by follow-up stages. There were 3184 offspring for whom we have consistently collected information on TSB retrospectively at 2–4 years, and prospectively at 14 and 21 years of age. Results: These comprised maternal-reported offspring TSB at 2–4 years and 14 years, and offspring-reported trouble sleeping at 14 and 21 years. One in two children had persistent trouble sleeping from 2–4 to 14 years and two-thirds from 14 to 21 years. In the adjusted analysis, compared with 2–4-years-old children with no trouble sleeping, those who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.44) times more likely to have trouble sleeping at 21 years. Similarly, adolescents who experienced trouble sleeping were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.66, 2.27) times more likely to experience trouble sleeping at 21 years. Conclusions: There is a continuity of TSB from early childhood through adolescence and young adulthood, although the persistence of TSB is strongest from adolescence to young adulthood. Interventions improving sleep in young children may prevent longer term difficulties in adolescents and young adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Psychopathology of childhood and adolescence: A neuropsychological approach.
AB  - Presents a case report of a 7-year-old boy, who presented with a history of developmental delays and learning problems. A neuropsychological assessment was requested by his parents and school to understand more about his cognitive functioning, and to assist in behavioral support and school placement. Alex was born following an uncomplicated pregnancy, and was full term, weighing 8 pounds, and 2 ounces. There were perinatal complications, including low sugar and jaundice, which resulted in a week-long stay in the NICU for light therapy. Upon discharge from the hospital, he had some difficulty with latching on to the breast, and was bottle fed soy formula. He did not sleep through the night until age 2, which resolved after having a tonsilar-adenoidectomy. He has been diagnosed with asthma, and takes occasional asthma medications. Parents opted to try stimulant medication at one point, but they felt that Alex became "zombie like," and very emotionally labile, so they stopped the medication. With the exception of occasional flare-ups of asthma, Alex is now healthy and well nourished. He sleeps soundly, around 10 hours per night, and is refreshed upon waking. On the basis of the assessment of Alex's cognitive, academic, adaptive skills, and behavior functioning, he was diagnosed with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), and ADHD. His measured Full Scale IQ score of 60 falls in the extremely low range, or what is considered mild mental retardation, according to the DSM-IV-TR. Furthermore, he shows concurrent deficits in adaptive functioning when compared with peers of a similar age, in areas including communication, self-care, social skills, self-direction, and functional academic skills.

Regarding emotional and behavioral functioning, Sarah reportedly exhibits problems with anxiety and difficulties with adjustment. She was described as "shy" and tends to avoid interacting with same-aged peers. Her mother reported that Sarah is "slow to warm" to others but has a few "very close" friends in the neighborhood. Available medical records were reviewed. No complications were noted during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. Sarah weighed 7 lbs, 11 oz at birth. Medical history is significant for recurrent headaches; however, the headaches have diminished in the past 4 months. No history of seizures or head injury was noted. No concerns regarding hearing, vision, or other sensory issues were noted. Her sleep and appetite are reportedly normal as well. She is prescribed no medications. Developmental speech and language and motor milestones were reportedly attained within normal limits. Sarah has a history of a learning disability, specifically dyslexia, expressive language delay, and headaches. Neuropsychological testing suggests that her academic abilities are lower than what would be expected given her cognitive functioning. Her cognitive abilities vary, but she demonstrated strength in the areas of fluid reasoning, visual-spatial abilities, and short-term memory span. She had greater difficulty with long-term retrieval of semantic information. While Sarah's basic reading skills are average, her reading comprehension and written expression is low average.

AB  - Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning that can emerge in relation to any sleep stage at any time of the night. These disorders may result in injuries, sleep disruption, adverse health effects, and psychological or interpersonal distress affecting a person and his or her bed partner or roommate. This chapter will begin by outlining a practical method to clinically investigate parasomnias in women. Subsequently a review will be presented on the pathophysiology and management of individual parasomnias. These include the NREM parasomnias, which including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors. Next, they will review REM parasomnias including REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other forms of dream-enactment behavior as well as isolated sleep paralysis. Previously, RBD has been considered primarily a disorder of elderly men. The authors extensively review two conditions that predominantly affect women but also defy current classification, sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) and sleep-related dissociative disorder. Interestingly, many cases of SRED may in fact actually be a non-motor manifestation of restless legs syndrome (RLS), a condition with a strong female predominance. Finally, they conclude with a review of parasomnias during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The large majority of women (84%) complain of insomnia at least a few nights a week during pregnancy, and one of three pregnant women say they rarely or never get a good night's sleep. Sleep continues to be disrupted for new mothers during the postpartum period, regardless of type of infant feeding, location of infant, or extent of support with infant care at night. Postpartum depression may be difficult to distinguish from chronic sleep deprivation. Chronic postpartum sleep loss places women and their families at risk for accidents if they are driving or caring for their infant while excessively sleepy. Sleep-deprived parents coping with a difficult infant may even place the infant at risk for physical abuse. This chapter reviews the expected changes in sleep that occur during pregnancy and postpartum, and highlights particular issues of concern to guide clinical assessment with the goal of minimizing risk for adverse maternal health outcomes associated with insomnia.

AB  - Objective: Postpartum depression (PPD) is an important health issue that affects not only mothers, but also entire families. Postpartum follow-up should address emotional and psychological issues, as well as physical issues, especially in those at risk. This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at an urban maternity clinic. Methods: This is a cross sectional study investigating the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related, pregnancy-related, and childrelated factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was 28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy, bottle-feeding only, mother’s lack of satisfaction with the baby’s sleep pattern, lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD. Conclusions: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly associated with PPD.

AB  - Comments on an article by J. Y. Ko et al. (see record 2012-21336-003) & J. L. Payne (see record 2012-21336-002). The recent articles by Ko et al. and Payne are fascinating and important. Both discusses that in the setting of care by obstetricians and gynecologists, screening is low for psychiatric disorders, which are often under diagnosed. Furthermore, the diagnosis of depression may be missed because of the overlap of pregnancy side effects with symptoms consistent with mood disorder, including sleep disorder and changes in energy, appetite, and concentration. These interesting articles by Ko et al. and Payne highlight the ongoing problem of women suffering from depression, which is not recognized and, therefore, not treated. The issue of unrecognized and untreated depression is significant, however, among all women regardless of age or whether or not they are pregnant. Symptoms of depression, as discussed, can mimic common changes during pregnancy. In older women, they can also mimic angina, and vice versa. In addition, depression is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and, therefore, is important to recognize in women. Postmenopausal women are at high risk for depression as well as coronary ischemia. The recently published articles by Ko et al. and by Payne are significant in highlighting that women should be screened and treated for depression.

AB  - Aims: The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self‐reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background: Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design: This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods: Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self‐reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21–40 years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post‐traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results: Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self‐reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion: When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over‐crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication.

T2  - Obesity: A ticking time bomb for reproductive health.
T3  - Elsevier insights.
AB  - Obesity is derived from the Latin term 'Obesus', which means 'one who has become plump through eating'. The negative effect of obesity on an individual's health has been known for a longer time and can be found in the writings of Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna. The rising prevalence of obesity is a pandemic of public concern affecting all age groups and not only confined to developed countries. Obesity increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, cancer (particularly colon and breast), cerebrovascular disease and osteoarthritis. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis including data from 57 prospective studies with 894,576 participants reported that for every increase in body mass index (BMI) of 5 kg/m² there was a 30% overall higher mortality with a 40% increase in vascular mortality, a greater than 50% increase in diabetic, renal and hepatic mortality, a 10% increase in neoplastic mortality and 20% increase in respiratory and other mortality [2]. In addition, overweight and obesity increases the risk of many other conditions including cerebrovascular disease, gallstones, osteoarthritis, sleep apnoea, impaired physical functioning, psychological illness and social discrimination. The impact of obesity on fertility and adverse outcomes of pregnancy are well recognised. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Study Objectives: Preeclampsia affects 5% to 7% of pregnancies, is strongly associated with low birth weight and fetal death, and is accompanied by sleep disordered breathing. We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep. Design, Setting, and Participants: First, a method of fetal movement recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and during a night of nasal CPAP. Intervention: Overnight continuous positive airway pressure. Measurements and Results: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). Conclusions: The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

AB  - Objective: Prenatal maternal anxiety has detrimental effects on the offspring’s neurocognitive development, including impaired attentional function. Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety and antidepressant use. Method: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD = 38). Results: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus. Conclusions: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.

AB  - The aims of this study were to examine: (1) the association between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and sleep quality in a population-based cohort of Australian women and (2) possible influence of reproductive status and mental and physical health factors on these associations. Data on 3,655 women (mean age = 46.6 years, range 34.3–67.4) were obtained from the Mater Hospital University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy for this cross-sectional study. Self-rated sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For the purpose of this study, two cutoff points (scores 5 and 10) were used to divide women into three categories: normal (65.2 %), moderately poor (26.4 %), and very poor sleep quality (8.5 %). Other covariates were measured at 21-year follow-up as well. After adjusting for reproductive status, mental and physical health, there were significant associations between moderately poor sleep quality and education and between very poor sleep quality and unemployment, both measures of socioeconomic status. In addition, work-related exertion was associated with increased rates of moderately poor sleep quality, whereas those women undertaking moderate exercise were less likely to experience very poor sleep quality. Independent associations between sociodemographic factors and exercise with moderately poor and very poor sleep quality were identified. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between exercise/exertion, socioeconomic status, and sleep quality and highlight the importance of taking these into consideration when dealing with issues of poor sleep quality in women.

AB  - The development of the EEG during childhood takes place in a typical, but individually variable way. The period of EEG maturation lasts from the 16th Week of gestation into early adulthood and undergoes, both during wakefulness and sleep, characteristic phases with typical EEG patterns, which differ to some extent from those of mature adult EEGs. This article will provide an overview of the maturation of EEG background activity and, as far as they are known, of their normal variants in the course of childhood. In the immature EEG of the preterm infant, the EEG-patterns of conventional EEG-recordings are compared to those of amplitude-integrated EEGs. In the EEG of later childhood, typical patterns of maturation are demonstrated and the main pathologic differential diagnoses of these signs of normal brain-development are mentioned.

TI  - The psychological birth of art: A psychoanalytic approach to prehistoric cave art.
AU  - Blum, Harold P.
T2  - International Forum of Psychoanalysis
AB  - The prehistoric art discovered in Eurasian caves, created from 37,000 to 12,000 years ago, has fascinated and perplexed historians and scientists. These caves were uninhabited, devoted to art, the first art galleries. A psychoanalytic interpretation of these extraordinary works, this paper addresses the motives of the Paleolithic artists, the meanings of their art, and the relationship of the art and the artists to the cave. While nonanalytic formulations are considered, from a psychoanalytic perspective, the interpretation of the cave is symbolic of the womb, the birth canal, and the primal cavity of self-object relationship. Art was created in identification with pregnancy and birth; art endured as reassurance against permanent darkness and death. Entering and leaving the cave could also represent coitus but, a on a deeper level, attachment and separation. The cave had magical and developmental significance, a transitional space between internal and external, fantasy and reality, death and rebirth. The creation of art and music, and the invention of intentional, controlled fire, marked the arrival of Homo sapiens, differentiated from all preceding and parallel primates. The painted cave might also have represented a cephalic container with illuminated imagery suggestive of dreaming sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Optimism is a disposition or tendency to see the more favorable side of events or conditions and to expect the most favorable outcome. Birth of a child brings joy and prosperity. Exhaustion after childbirth, stress, changes in the daily routine, and lack of sleep in the first weeks, and even months of the child's life may not be the causes, but, as today's statistics show, they add to the condition which in 10% of cases leads to the postpartum depression. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to examine the correlation between optimism, pessimism and emotional regulation and control and the postpartum depression in new mothers during the most critical period for the onset of postpartum depression of seven days to six months. Another aim is to examine the correlation between demographic characteristics (age, education level, and number of pregnancies) and the onset of postpartum depression. Results indicate that postpartum depression is in correlation with emotional regulation and control, as well as with pessimism, and in negative correlation with optimism. Another significant result based on socio-demographic variables is the correlation between postpartum depression in women and high level of professional qualifications.

AB  - While women have a higher objective sleep efficiency than do men, they paradoxically report more sleep problems. It is unclear whether the reporting gap is a descriptive difference or measurement problem. Certainly, some sleep disorders, such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and hypersomnolence, are more frequent in women, whereas others, such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), are more prevalent in men. This chapter reviews gender-specific sleep disorders and the impact of pair-sleeping in the context of sex differences in sleep, reproductive phases, and circadian timing across the life span.

AB  - Reproductive control has been viewed as a means of empowering women, supporting the improvement of their psychological wellbeing and physical health. The papers in this edition of the journal reflect a range of associated reproductive and parenting issues. It is important to understand the processes involved when women or men make decisions regarding reproductive behavior and how the decisions made or the decision- making processes affect women’s health and self-image and also that of their partner. This is true for both wanted and unwanted pregnancy. The objectives of a number of studies published in the journal have included understanding the experiences, attitudes and decisions women make in exercising their reproductive choices in pregnancy more broadly, and the effects those decisions have on women’s health and wellbeing. The papers on parenting in this edition reflect very different aspects of early parent and infant behavior, nevertheless important ones as far as the wellbeing of both parents and children is concerned: differences interaction with mothers with serious mental health problems and the effect on mothers of having young children with sleep problems.

AB  - This paper examines racial differences in trends and predictors of prone and lateral infant sleep positioning among South Carolina mothers and infants. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648 mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning (28.2–66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6–47.1%) than white infants. Compared to births in 2000–2005, births after the explicit recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position (2006–2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87) but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in sudden infant death syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry
AB  - Presents a case report of a Mr Paul Harder, a 66 year-old right-handed male architect was born after an uneventful pregnancy and suffered no childhood diseases before developing epilepsy at age 7 years. Initially, seizures consisted of episodes of the right hand and arm shaking. He was treated with numerous antiepileptic drugs throughout childhood and adolescence, with a maximum interval between seizures of 2 years, aged 15 to 17, with no concurrent change in his antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Following this, however, his epilepsy remained refractory to medical treatment. Habitual seizures occurred during wake and sleep, and had always been stereotyped. Seizures consisted of an initial indescribable feeling in his head and/or moving up the right arm followed by hypermotor movements of the right arm, sometimes spreading to the right leg and the whole of the right side. The patient declined the option of intracranial EEG and surgical treatment, and seizures continued at a rate of 10e20 seizures a month following adjustment of his AEDs. FCD are localised areas of abnormal cortical organisation and/or dysplastic neurons and are increasingly recognised as a cause of medically refractory focal epilepsy as MRI technology improves, resulting in its detection.

AB  - Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity, disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing neurons are important for the maintenance of vigilance and regulation of motor activity but their hyperactivity may contribute to anxiety disorders. Using a rat model, we tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal AE. Male rat pups received 2.625g/kg of alcohol (AE group) intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4–9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD12–14, they received daily injections of either the ORX-1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V) during the lights-off period. On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test. On PD17, their motor activity was monitored in a novel environment. The percentage of tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved and the number of trials needed to reach the shortest HR latency were higher, whereas the percentage of successful trials was lower, in AE–V than in S–V rats (p =0.0009–0.03). In contrast, these measures were not significantly different between AE–SB and either S–SB or S–V rats. Motor activity in AE–V rats was significantly higher than in S–V (p =0.003), S–SB (p =0.007) or AE–SB (p =0.02) rats, with no difference between S–SB and AE–SB group. Our findings suggest that excessive activity of ORX neurons contributes to motor hyperactivity and impaired HR acquisition following perinatal AE and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of ORX-1 receptors.

T2  - Journal of Biological Rhythms
AB  - The impact of ovarian hormones on hamster ultradian rhythms (URs) is unknown. We concurrently monitored URs and circadian rhythms (CRs) of home cage locomotor activity during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation of Syrian hamsters. URs with a mean period of 4-5 h were evident during the dark phase in more than 90% of females on days 1 and 2 of the estrous cycle but were significantly less prevalent on cycle days 3 and 4. The period of the UR did not vary as a function of estrous cycle stage, but at all stages, the UR period was longer in the dark than the light phase. The UR acrophase occurred significantly earlier on cycle day 4 than on days 1 and 2, and UR robustness and amplitude were reduced on days 3 and 4. Robustness, mesor, and amplitude of CRs were greater during cycle days 3 and 4; timing of the CR acrophase was delayed on day 4 relative to all other cycle days. Effects of the estrous cycle on URs were evident only during the dark phase. The proportion of hamsters displaying dark phase URs increased significantly during early and late gestation and decreased during lactation. Pregnancy significantly increased UR complexity, robustness, and amplitude. The emergence of URs over gestation was paralleled by decrements in the robustness and amplitude of CRs, which also were absent in a significant proportion of dams during lactation but re-emerged at weaning of litters. The changing endocrine profile of the estrous cycle, hormonal dynamics of pregnancy and lactation, and nursing demands placed on dams are each associated with alterations in the expression of ultradian and circadian locomotor rhythms. Diminution of CRs and augmentation of URs may afford greater behavioral flexibility during life stages when interactions with mates and offspring are less predictable.

AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) utilized by pregnant women influence fetal neurobehavioral development. In this observational study we investigated developmental milestones of fetal behavior during the pregnancy of women with psychiatric disorders who took SSRIs throughout gestation (medicated group; n = 96) or who had discontinued medication early in gestation or before conception (unmedicated group; n = 37). Healthy unexposed fetuses of women without mental disorders comprised the control group (n = 130). Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior were made three times in pregnancy (T1-T3). Effects of SSRIs were studied over a wide range of dosages (low, standard, or high) and for different drug types. Fetuses exposed to standard or high SSRI dosages compared with control, unmedicated, or low-medicated fetuses showed significantly increased motor activity at the beginning (T1) and end of the second trimester (T2). They particularly exhibited disrupted emergence of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM; quiet) sleep during the third trimester, characterized by continual bodily activity and, thus, poor inhibitory motor control during this sleep state near term (T3). The SSRI effects on the fetus were dose related, but independent of SSRI type. The results demonstrate changes in fetal neurobehavioral development associated with standard and high SSRI dosages that are observable throughout gestation. A first-choice SSRI type was not apparent. Bodily activity at high rate during non-REM sleep in SSRI-exposed fetuses is an abnormal phenomenon, but its significance for postnatal development is unclear.

T2  - International Journal of Obesity
AB  - Objective: To examine the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the body composition of offspring. Subjects: Grade 4 elementary school children (n = 1366; boys/girls, 724/642; 9-10 years old) were enrolled in this study. All parents answered a lifestyle questionnaire, and children underwent passive smoking tests. Urinary cotinine measurement and lifestyle screening test parameters (that is, body weight, body length, body mass index (BMI), obesity index (OI), blood tests for liver function and lipid profile and questions regarding maternal smoking and lifestyle) were evaluated in terms of their relationship with maternal smoking. In addition, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentration was measured in 80 randomly selected children to assess its relationship with oxidative stress. Results: Both BMI and OI were significantly higher in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy than in those whose mothers never smoked (BMI: 17.2 ± 2.7 vs 16.9 ± 2.5 kgm-2, P = 0.016; OI: 2.7 ± 14.3% vs 0.4 ± 14.0%, P = 0.003). The degree of elevation was positively correlated with the duration of maternal smoking. The increases in BMI and OI resulted from increased body weight and reduced height. The confounding factors-‘breakfast with family’, ‘watching television at dinner’, ‘eating and drinking before sleep’, ‘watching television for 42 h’, ‘sleep duration o8 h’ and ‘playing sports’-were statistically significant. BMI and OI were significantly high in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy in these six confounders. On the other hand, urinary 8-OHdG concentration was negatively correlated with BMI in children who had 41.3 ng ml-1 urinary cotinine, suggesting that it may be related to basal metabolism due to oxidative stress. Conclusion: Maternal smoking is a risk factor for higher BMI and OI in 9- to 10-year-old children whose mothers smoke during pregnancy and may be independent of other confounding factors.

TI  - Sleep deprivation and postpartum mental health: Case report.
AU  - Sloan, Eileen P.
T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - Presents a case report of a 28-year-old woman. She was first seen at 17 days postpartum. There was no prior history of hypomania in the context of sleep restriction. To her knowledge, there was no family psychiatric history. She was not on any medication. She did not drink alcohol or use recreational substances. The pregnancy had been normal throughout. At 39 weeks gestational age, she went into labor. The labor lasted for 4 days during which time she was unable to sleep due to frequent and painful contractions. She was eventually admitted to hospital and the delivery was facilitated with oxytocin. A normal infant was delivered vaginally. She found herself unable to rest or sleep and busied herself with household chores, a pattern which would continue for the next 2 weeks. She started to become suspicious of her husband with whom she previously had an excellent relationship, accusing him of not loving her and fearing he was going to harm the infant. Her behavior was somewhat bizarre: she went to stay overnight in the home of a couple with whom she was not particularly close. There was no perceptual abnormality or other features of psychosis. It was felt that both her insight and judgment were reduced. The only medication prescribed during the 4-day stay was lorazepam 1 mg qhs to help sleep. She has been followed as an outpatient for 6 months and, to date, there has been no recurrence of her symptoms and her mood has remained stable.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of postpartum depression in a regular clinical setting among Chilean women. The Postpartum Depression Screening Scale, Spanish Version was used to assess symptoms of depression. Chilean women (45%) reported depressive symptoms including suicidal thoughts, sleeping/eating disturbances, and emotional stability. Factors that predicted the probability of PPD included attitudes concerning pregnancy, social support, and tobacco use. Routine screening for PPD could make a difference in prevention, prompt diagnosis, and management of postpartum depression in developing countries.

TI  - The biopsychosocial model of metabolic syndrome among U.S. adults.
AU  - Saylor, Jennifer
AB  - Background: The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of medical disorders (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin/resistance/glucose intolerance) that characteristically occur together in individuals. The prevalence of MetS continues to increase in the U.S. and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Little research uses a theoretical model to identify direct or indirect contributions to MetS and predictors to MetS. Identifying the factors that influence MetS in a national sample is necessary to understand targets for intervention to prevent the MetS and its sequelae. Purpose: This study tested a hypothesized conceptual model of the biopsychosocial factors associated with MetS in adults using a representative sample. Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008 data from non-pregnant participants who were 20-80 years old and completed the questionnaire and medical examination with fasting laboratory data. The sample of 2,583 adults represented 212 million non-institutionalized civilian Americans living in the U.S. Path analysis was conducted to test the biopsychosocial model of MetS. Complex samples logistic regression models (CSLR) were utilized to examine the direct and indirect contributions of biomedical (age), biosocial (gender, race, education, income, and marital status), and psychosocial factors (depressive symptoms, diet, physical activity, smoking status, and sleep) to MetS. Results: Of the study population, 29% met the criteria for MetS and 95% had at least one component of MetS. The hypothesized model fit the nationally representative data. The parsimonious model with age, gender, race, education, income, depressive symptoms, physical activity, smoking, and the interaction between age and physical activity explained 25.2% of the variance in the presence of MetS. Mediating effects among the biosocial and psychosocial factors help explain their relationship with MetS. Conclusion: The study supported the hypothesized model and the contributions of biopsychosocial factors to MetS. The study indicated that certain demographic groups were vulnerable to MetS. More studies are needed to examine factors associated with MetS than were from the hypothesized model. Prospective studies are needed to improve psychosocial status and to prevent/reverse MetS.

AB  - Introduction: Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for nonaffective psychosis (NAP) in the offspring, although the mechanism(s) of this association are not clear. The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the “de novo mutation” hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP. Methods: Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population birth cohort. Results: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 0.99–1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a father with schizophrenia and APA. Discussion: In both a general population cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the “de novo mutation” hypothesis.

AB  - Objective: Connexin hemichannels can open during ischemia, resulting in loss of membrane potential, calcium influx, and release of glutamate. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may contribute to delayed evolution of injury. Methods: We infused a mimetic peptide that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 ± 1 days gestation (term is 147 days), starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7 days later. Results: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from −13 ± 1.9dB (n = 7) after ischemia–vehicle to −9 ± 1.6dB (n = 7) after ischemia–short infusion and −5 ± 1.6dB after ischemia–long infusion (n = 6, p p p p p p < 0.05 vs sham control). Interpretation: These data support the hypothesis that opening of connexin hemichannels is a significant mediator of postischemic white and gray matter dysfunction and injury.

TI  - Fetal sleep organization: A biological precursor of self-regulation in childhood and adolescence?
AU  - Van den Bergh, Bea R. H.
AU  - Mulder, Eduard J. H.
T2  - Biological Psychology
AB  - Fetal sleep states emerge during the third trimester of pregnancy and involve multiple interconnected neuronal networks. We examined whether fetal sleep characteristics predict child and adolescent self-regulation in a non-clinical sample (study group, n = 25; reference group, n = 48). Combined recordings of three sleep variables (fetal heart rate, body movements and rapid eye movements) were made for 2 h at 36–38 weeks’ gestation. Fetuses showing synchronous change of sleep variables (i.e. within 3 min) at transition from quiet into active sleep reached a higher level of effortful control, both at 8–9 and 14–15 years, than fetuses not making synchronous transitions and compared with the reference group. Results are discussed from a Developmental Origins of Behavior, Health and Disease (DOBHaD) point of view. It is concluded that studying sleep ontogeny offers the possibility to gain insight into brain maturational processes and/or environmental adaptive processes that may have long term behavioral developmental consequences.

T2  - Nursing Research
AB  - Background: Sleep disturbance is a significant health issue in pregnant women. Although previous studies contribute to an understanding of the multifactorial nature of pregnancy-related sleep disturbance, objective measures of sleep were not included, and so data may be subject to recall and potential participant self-report bias. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors associated with poor sleep quality in women during their third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: This prospective study included 30 nulliparous women who wore a wrist actigraph to objectively monitor sleep for 7 consecutive days and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Fifteen women (50%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score of >5, indicating poor sleep quality. Mean actigraphic sleep efficiency was only 80.05% ± 6.27%. There were significant differences (p < .01) in sleep offset time and total nocturnal sleep time between weekdays and weekends. Later sleep onset time was associated with poorer sleep, including longer sleep latency, and reduced total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency. Discussion: Nulliparous women experience both objective and subjective sleep disturbances, and their sleep patterns differ between weekdays and weekends during their third trimester of pregnancy. Results suggest that maternal sleep pattern may be improved by maintaining a regular and earlier bedtime so women have more opportunity to obtain sufficient nocturnal sleep and improved sleep quality.

AB  - A long-standing critique of adolescent employment is that it engenders a precocious maturity of more adult-like roles and behaviors, including school disengagement, substance use, sexual activity, inadequate sleep and exercise, and work-related stress. Though negative effects of high-intensity work on adolescent adjustment have been found, little research has addressed whether such work experiences are associated with precocious family formation behaviors in adolescence, such as sexual intercourse, pregnancy, residential independence, and union formation. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that teenagers who spend long hours on the job during the school year are more likely to experience these family formation behaviors earlier than youth who work moderately or not at all.

AU  - Santos, Iná S.

T2  - Pediatrics
AB  - Objective: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age. Methods: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression. Results: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (≥300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%–16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming ≥300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86–3.17) but at a nonsignificant level. Conclusions: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months.

T2  - Depression and Anxiety
AB  - Background: Sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression are common during pregnancy. Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181) groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained. Results: Depressed women had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values ≤.05). However, the frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values ≤.05). Conclusions: At 20 and 30 weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause several cognitive and behavioral difficulties. Few studies have investigated the associations with infant temperament or sleeping patterns. Our aim was to study potential associations between early prenatal binge exposure and infant temperament and sleeping pattern. Methods: In a population based longitudinal study, representative of pregnant women in Oslo, questionnaires were answered at 17 and 30 weeks of pregnancy and 6 months after term. Two factors, difficult temperament and sleeping problems, were identified using Principal Component Analysis and dichotomized at the least optimal 14–15%. Logistic regression analyses identified predictive factors. Results: Maternal binge drinking (≥ 5 drinks per occasion) once a week during pregnancy week 0–6 significantly predicted both difficult temperament (Odds Ratio OR 3.3**; 95% Confidence interval CI 1.4–7.9) and sleeping problems (OR 5.3**; 95% CI 2.1–13.7) in the infant, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Including binge drinking more often than once a week, further increased the OR of sleeping problems (6.0***; 2.7–13.7). Prenatal maternal depressive symptoms also predicted both outcomes. Reduced birth weight predicted difficult temperament. Maternal satisfaction with life reduced the probability of sleeping problems. Maternal smoking, and work stress, during pregnancy had no predictive power. The results were not explained by binge drinking later during pregnancy or higher consumption per occasion. Conclusions: Binge drinking once a week during pregnancy week 0–6 had stronger predictive power of difficult temperament and sleeping problems during infancy, than other covariates. The findings support advising women to avoid binge drinking when planning pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Maternal breastfeeding experiences and neonatal breastfeeding behaviors of children later diagnosed with autism.
AU  - Lucas, Ruth F.
AB  - The two studies presented here describe neonatal breastfeeding as a measure of neonatal processing. The first paper describes the theoretical framework which guides both studies, the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing. The first paper also reviews the state of the science for the measurement of neonatal processing, neonatal neurobehavioral organization (NNBO). The second paper is the first study to describe breastfeeding behaviors, a measure of NNBO, of children later diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The first study describes the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing theoretical framework, reviews the science of NNBO biobehavioral measures, and provides a short summary of a descriptive study using breastfeeding as an NNBO measure. The Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing uses three concepts, a neonate, the environment (maternal factors) and the neonatal mental system. Neonatal processing occurs within the neonatal mental system. The mental system may be assessed by NNBO biobehaviors, specifically breastfeeding. Breastfeeding and other NNBO biobehavioral measures of sleep/wake states, vagal tone and heart rate variability, neurophysiological measures of eventrelated potential of brain activity, and nutritive sucking and sucking patterns of bottle feeding literature is reviewed. NNBO biobehavioral measures have been found to be predictive of developmental outcomes. Breastfeeding, however, as an NNBO biobehavioral measure, has limited research as a predictive measure for cognitive and social outcomes. A short summary describes maternal breastfeeding experiences of mothers of children later diagnosed with ASD using the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing as a guide. Mothers described their breastfeeding experiences and their neonate's breastfeeding behaviors. Many of the neonates' breastfeeding behaviors were described as demonstrating an atypical breastfeeding pattern, “insatiable feeding”, which may reflect early alteration in processing. The second paper applies the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing in a retrospective study. The study describes the maternal breastfeeding experiences during the first month after delivery of mothers who breastfed children later diagnosed with ASD. Mothers were interviewed in their homes, offices, libraries, at local shopping malls and restaurants. The interview used three measures created from the three major concepts within the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing: a maternal socio-environmental questionnaire, a semi-structured interview, and a post-interview summary. Participants were a convenience sample of 20 mothers (13 primiparas, 7 multiparas). Maternal age range was 28–60 years of age (M = 43.3, SD = 9.6). Two mothers had more than one son diagnosed with ASD. One mother had two sons and the second mother had three sons diagnosed with ASD for a total sample of 23 breastfed neonates. All 23 children had been full term neonates (38–42 weeks gestation) with birth weight > 2500 grams, diagnosed with ASD between ages of 18 months to 11 years of age (M = 4.3, SD = 2.4) and age range at the time of the maternal interview was 5–35 years of age (M = 11.5,  SD = 7.6). Mothers described three types of breastfeeding experiences affected by the maternal environmental factor of professional support. One mother's experience overlapped between the first and second group. The first group (n=4) recalled breastfeeding success with no or limited professional support. The second group (n = 11) breastfed successfully after receiving positive professional support (one mother overlapped with group one), and the third group (n = 6) had variable success with breastfeeding after receiving unfavorable professional support. Support provided to the second and third groups was given for inexperience, anatomical barriers and neo… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Psychotherapists as parents & providers: Parenthood & countertransference in treating traumatized children.
AU  - Jalowiec, Barbara A.
AB  - The current study explores how child trauma therapists who are also parents experience both of their roles. While many therapists have written case studies about their pregnancies, with a few commenting on later parenthood, this phenomenon has not been examined more systematically. Few focus on clinical work with children or traumatized children. Others examine therapist-parenthood from the outside, focusing on therapists' children and partners, but not the experiences of the therapists. Better studied are the effects of vicarious and secondary traumatization, though little research speaks to potential differences from adult therapy in work with traumatized children. Despite indications that there is overlap between countertransference, vicarious and secondary trauma, parenthood, and child trauma, no researchers have explored this. Psychological phenomenology was used to examine these areas of overlap in the lives of 11 child trauma therapists, exploring the challenges and benefits brought about by the dual roles of parent and therapist. The results indicate that not only do the roles of child trauma therapist and parent inform one another, but they also provide benefits such as a greater understanding of development and the needs of children, increased compassion and empathy for clients and their parents, appreciation for one's own children, and a better understanding of parenthood. Challenges include an increase in negative countertransference with clients' parents. Another issue was the concern that one's psychological insights and knowledge unduly affect the parent-child relationship. Further, experiences of secondary, though not vicarious, traumatization were reported, including symptoms of fear, anxiety, mistrust, vigilance, nightmares, avoidance, sleep and appetite disturbances, and fatigue. Participants also described feeling more protective of their own children in relation to their clinical work. The interaction between parenthood and being a child trauma therapist is an important one to consider in terms of self-care and supervision. Future research in this area might focus on the experiences of secondary and vicarious traumatization in child trauma therapists and therapist-parents as well.

AB  - Background: In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the relation between sleeping arrangements and infant cortisol reactivity to stressors in the first two post-natal months. Co-sleeping, as compared to solitary sleeping, is hypothesized to provide more parental external stress regulation by night, thus reducing general stress sensitivity. We therefore expected lower cortisol reactivity to stress in infants who co-slept more regularly. Methods: Participants were 163 mothers and infants from uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies. Mothers completed daily diaries on sleeping arrangements in the first 7 weeks of life. Co-sleeping was defined as sleeping in the parents’ bedroom (i.e. own or parents’ bed). Cortisol reactivity was measured twice: to a mild physical stressor (bathing session) at 5 weeks of age and to a mild pain stressor (vaccination) at 2 months of age. Results: Infants with a solitary sleeping arrangement in their first month of life showed a heightened cortisol response to the bathing session at 5 weeks compared to infants that co-slept regularly. This effect was not explained by breastfeeding practices, maternal caregiving behavior, or infants’ night waking and sleep duration. No effects were found of co-sleeping on the cortisol response to the vaccination at 2 months. Conclusions: The results suggest that solitary sleeping in the first month of life is associated with heightened sensitivity of the HPA-axis to a mild stressor, possibly due to less nocturnal parental availability as external stress regulator. Whether this effect continues in later life, remains to be investigated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - 'To make it through each day still pregnant’: Pregnancy bed rest and the disciplining of the maternal body.
AU  - Alcalde, M. Cristina
T2  - Journal of Gender Studies
AB  - This article provides a qualitative, non-medical analysis of pregnancy bed rest to contribute to feminist scholarship on women’s experiences of embodiment and reproduction. Drawing on surveys and interviews, I examine pregnancy bed rest from the perspective of those who have experienced it. I argue that pregnancy bed rest significantly disrupts women’s sense of control over their bodies, and that this disruption is partly manifested through feelings of failure and self-blame. Women’s feelings of failure are heightened within a cultural context that emphasizes the importance of individual control over reproductive processes and ignores marginalized experiences of pregnancy. I then examine how women strategize ways to momentarily regain some control over their self and lives and thereby reduce feelings of failure. Analysis of women’s pregnancy bed rest experiences furthers our understanding of an experience that drastically alters women’s sense of control and self-discipline as well as their relationship to their bodies. It also sheds light on pregnancy as an experience that is informed at least as much by the cultural context as it is by the body. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Maternal treatment with synthetic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DEX) significantly reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality, but its effects on the fetal brain remain unclear. In this study we evaluated the effects of DEX on EEG activity in preterm fetal sheep. Ewes at 103 days gestation received two intramuscular injections of DEX (12 mg, n = 8) or saline vehicle (n = 7) 24 h apart. Fetal EEG activity was recorded from 6 h before until 120 h after the first injection (DEX-1). DEX-1 was associated with a marked transient rise in total EEG power, maximal at 12 h (P P vs. controls (P P < 0.001). No histological neural injury or microglial activation was seen. In summary, exposure to maternal dexamethasone was associated with dramatic, evolving low-frequency hyperactivity on fetal cortical EEG recordings, followed by sustained changes consistent with maturation of fetal sleep architecture. We postulate that these effects may contribute to improved neonatal outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The cardiovascular structure is temporally organized in both health and disease. The link between obesity and hypertension is elevated sympathetic nervous system activity and hormonal activity which present a clear rhythmicity, with the pineal, corticosteroid and leptin systems being those most implicated. Also, genetic mutations or deletions have implicated peripheral clock genes in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, which are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. As hypertension and obesity are related, and the treatments of these disorders are well established but sometimes ineffective, this review focuses on chronobiological contributions to decrease the burden of hypertension and obesity in low- and middle-income groups of individuals. MEDLINE, Pubmed and SUM Search sites (2001–2011) were used in the search strategy, together with the keywords: "antihypertensive drugs"; "arterial hypertension"; "circadian rhythms"; "obesity"; and "sleep quality". Eighty-six articles were found and 50 articles from these were selected. A link between the circadian clock and hypertension has recently been described in animal models, using Clock-mutant mice that display metabolic syndrome. Experimental evidence clearly implicates circadian rhythms in the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the blood pressure (BP) rhythm. Most clinical studies of BP focus on some pathological situation, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes or pregnancy with blood biomarker alterations. However, epidemiological evidence for the role of circadian rhythms in hypertension has been lacking until recently. In Brazil, in an epidemiological, cross-sectional study, changed sleep quality and an earlier phase of mid-sleep were found in those using antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, some pharmacological studies support a circadian- and dose-dependent relationship in the use of antihypertensive drugs for the 24-h control of BP. In low- and middle-income areas, cost-effectiveness of any intervention is fundamental to the implementation of any kind of public-health policy. Therefore, improvements in diagnosis, effectiveness and implementing prevention measures to control the risk of disease are all necessary, and there is evidence that chronobiology has an important role to play. Consequently, it is important to provide guidelines to monitor BP to reduce cardiovascular risk that include chronobiological aspects of the problem.

T2  - Maternal and Child Health Journal
AB  - Not using the infant back sleep position is an established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk, particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged 2004–2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences. Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83–1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs.

AB  - Background: Treatment of schizophrenia frequently includes prolonged benzodiazepine administration despite a lack of evidence of its use. It is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines because of the development of dependence. We aim to assess if melatonin can facilitate the withdrawal of prolonged benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction with the following clinically important variables: sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Methods/Design: Randomized, blinded, two-armed, parallel superiority trial. We plan to include 80 consenting outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 18-55 years of age, treated with antipsychotic drug(s) and at least one benzodiazepine derivative for the last three months before inclusion. Exclusion criteria: currently under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, aggressive or violent behavior, known mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, dementia, epilepsy, terminal illness, severe co morbidity, inability to understand Danish, allergy to melatonin, lactose, starch, gelatin, or talc, hepatic impairment, pregnancy or nursing, or lack of informed consent. After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin®) 2 mg daily or matching placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their benzodiazepine dose. The primary outcome measure is benzodiazepine dose at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include sleep, psychophysiological, and neurocognitive measures. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up regarding medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, sleep, laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social function, and quality of life. Data on medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, adverse events, social function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months follow-up. Discussion: The results from this trial will examine whether melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in schizophrenia patients. This group of patients is difficult to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life expectancy of patients compared to the background population. The results will also provide new information on the association of chronic benzodiazepine treatment with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The chasm within: My battle with personality disorder.
AU  - Gray, Jessica
T2  - Philosophy, Psychiatry, & Psychology
AB  - Long before I knew I had a personality disorder, I simply knew that my life felt unbearably difficult to live. For me, life has always been an uphill struggle, and at times I have just let myself tumble down the hill I have strived so hard to climb. Fortunately, I now understand how to keep going, and even to avoid falling down in the first place, but this learning process has taken the entire twenty-eight years of my life, and I still feel I have a long way to go. It feels very difficult to describe the early years of my life. To me, it was like being stuck in a cage, gigged. Throughout my childhood, it was extremely difficult to relate to other children. School was a terrifying place. My dad told me repeatedly in 'oracles' that I was different to other children: 'chosen' like him. At home, my father praised me over my brother, because he was more rebellious and outspoken, and less academically successful. My relationships with men have been the aspect of my life that has caused me the most pain. I felt, and still feel sometimes, a deep mistrust for and anger toward them. And yet I feel I desperately need their love and attention, even if I have to be manipulative or forceful to get it. When I was thirteen, I was raped by a boy I knew. My deep hatred toward my body began the night I was raped. This began to play itself out in my cutting. Soon I started going out with a boy who had a similarly apathetic attitude toward school. He was the first boy who genuinely seemed to have feelings for me beyond just wanting to sleep with me. We spent all our time together, got engaged within two weeks, and within two months, at the age of fifteen, I was pregnant. As a fifteen-year-old single mother, I rapidly lost my friendship group from school. I overdosed on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication several times. The trigger was frequently feeling rejected by my boyfriend. This was often an overreaction to a minor event. The repeated hostile treatment I received from nurses in hospital did not prevent me from self-harming. But somehow, when I came to the end of my A-levels, I found the strength to stop taking overdoses, although I continued to cut for several years. At university, I had the chance to gain some perspective on my life and my behavior as I was far away from what had become my home. I saw several psychotherapists and counselors, and in a new setting felt more open to trying their suggestions and thinking about alternative perspectives. Although I found cognitive-behavioral therapy very helpful, as well as meditation and mindfulness techniques, only one counselor was actually honest enough with me to say that I had Borderline Personality Disorder. In my adult life, I have struggled a great deal with a sense of identity confusion, and an unsettling feeling that I may not be doing the right job or on the right course. Being a member of this Therapeutic Community really helped me to break down my social anxieties and recognize the ways in which my behavior and decisions affect those around me and ultimately what happens in my life. I now work part time in a shop and run my own graphic design business from home! I feel I can enjoy life much more than before I went into therapy, as I've worked through many of the difficult feelings I've been carrying around since childhood. Unfortunately, my relationships with men still feel chaotic and painful. My current goals are to work toward getting a higher paid job in which I feel more comfortable, and to achieve a greater sense of stability and peace in my relationships with men. I accept that my problems are not going to disappear and that recovery is a lifelong process, but I no longer feel despair about this. I have hope for each new day.

AB  - Some infants show a free-running rhythm in their rest-activity. We do not know why, nor do we know exactly what the entrainment factors are for the development of the normal 24-h rest-activity rhythm. Actigraphic recordings on 10 primiparae during late pregnancy and these mothers and their infants during the 2nd, 6th, and 12th wks after birth were made over 3–5 continuous days to investigate maternal and infant entrainment. One infant showed a free-running rest-activity circadian rhythm. In late pregnancy, the period in the autocorrelogram of the mother with the free-running infant was longer than the significant period of the mean autocorrelogram of the mothers with nonfree-running infants. The finding of this study indicates the free-running rhythm of infant is not reset by maternal entrainment factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Mental Health and Physical Activity
AB  - Statement of problem: Few studies have examined the influence of physical activity on sleep among pregnant women. To examine the potential sleep-enhancing benefits of physical activity among pregnant women and to therefore see if physical activity may serve as a non-pharmacological treatment for sleep disturbances during pregnancy, this study’s purpose was to examine the association between objectively-measured physical activity and sleep among a nationally representative sample of U.S. pregnant women. Methods: Data from the National Health and Examination Survey 2005-2006 was used for the present study. 138 pregnant women who had worn an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer on the right hip for at least 4 days for a minimum of 10 h per day were identified. Questions on sleep were asked during the household interview. Results: Of the 22 sleeping-related parameters assessed, physical activity was only associated with two. After controlling for depression, gestation, income and parity, for every 1-min increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, pregnant women were 17% less likely to have difficulty finishing a meal because of being tired or sleepy (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.98-1.38, p = 0.06). Conclusion: Our data suggests a weak relationship between objectively-measured physical activity and sleep. Additional research using a larger sample of pregnant women, as well as experimental studies, are needed to determine the extent to which physical activity may assist in improving sleeping-related parameters among pregnant women.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to examine pathways from prenatal cigarette exposure to physiological regulation at 2 months of age. Specifically, we explored the possibility that any association between prenatal cigarette exposure and infant physiological regulation was moderated by fetal growth, prenatal or postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. We evaluated whether exposed infants who were also exposed to ETS after birth, were small for gestational age (SGA) or had mothers with higher depressive symptoms during pregnancy had the highest levels of physiological dysregulation. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was obtained from 234 (166 exposed and 68 nonexposed) infants during sleep. As expected, cigarette-exposed infants had significantly lower RSA than nonexposed infants. This association was not moderated by prenatal or postnatal ETS exposure, or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. However, small for gestational age status did moderate this association such that nonexposed infants who were not small for gestational age had a significantly higher RSA than nonexposed small for gestational age infants and exposed infants. These findings provide additional evidence that prenatal cigarette exposure is directly associated with dysregulation during infancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: To identify and characterize the trajectories of depressive and fatigue symptoms and determine the relationship between these two trajectories and associated predictors. Design: A prospective, follow-up study. Setting: A teaching medical center in central Taiwan. Participants: A convenience sample of 121 low-risk, childbearing women. Methods: Depressive and fatigue symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Fatigue Continuum Form respectively during the third trimester (time 1), one day postpartum (time 2), three days postpartum (time 3), and one week postpartum (time 4). Participants also completed structured questionnaires on demographic features, health status, and sleep quality. Results: The mean age of participants was 31.2 years. We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Overlapping but distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms and fatigue were found. These results suggest that differentiation between depressive symptoms and fatigue is possible and important for improving care during the early postpartum period.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether snoring, sleep position, and other sleep practices in pregnant women are associated with risk of late stillbirth. Design: Prospective population based case-control study. Setting: Auckland, New Zealand. Participants: Cases: 155 women with a singleton late stillbirth (≥28 weeks’ gestation) without congenital abnormality born between July 2006 and June 2009 and booked to deliver in Auckland. Controls: 310 women with single ongoing pregnancies and gestation matched to that at which the stillbirth occurred. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounding factors. Main outcome measure: Maternal snoring, daytime sleepiness (measured with the Epworth sleepiness scale), and sleep position at the time of going to sleep and on waking (left side, right side, back, and other). Results: The prevalence of late stillbirth in this study was 3.09/1000 births. No relation was found between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the previous night (before stillbirth or interview) were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who slept on their left side (adjusted odds ratio for back sleeping 2.54 (95% CI 1.04 to 6.18), and for right side sleeping 1.74 (0.98 to 3.01)). The absolute risk of late stillbirth for women who went to sleep on their left was 1.96/1000 and was 3.93/1000 for women who did not go to sleep on their left. Women who got up to go to the toilet once or less on the last night were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who got up more frequently (adjusted odds ratio 2.28 (1.40 to 3.71)). Women who regularly slept during the day in the previous month were also more likely to experience a late stillbirth than those who did not (2.04 (1.26 to 3.27)). Conclusions: This is the first study to report maternal sleep related practices as risk factors for stillbirth, and these findings require urgent confirmation in further studies.

AB  - This was a prospective, cohort study in Korean pregnant and postpartum women, to estimate the prevalence and patterns of sleep disturbances. The survey was composed of the following validated sleep questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, Berlin Questionnaire for sleep disordered breathing, the international restless leg syndrome (IRLS) Study Group criteria, and the Johns Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview Form (JHTDIF) for RLS. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0. Six hundred eighty-nine women completed sleep surveys. The overall percentage of women with very poor sleep quality (a PSQI score greater than 10), clinically significant insomnia (a total score of 9 or more), excessive daytime sleepiness (a total ESS score of 10 or more), short sleep duration (less than 7 hours per night) were 80.7%, 50.5%, 34.0% and 29.5%, respectively, and all of three parameters became increased as pregnancy progressed and after delivery ( p = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The overall positive rates in Berlin and RLS questionnaires were 25.4% and 19.4%. In conclusion, sleep disturbances are prevalent among Korean pregnant and postpartum women, and increase significantly as pregnancy progresses and after delivery.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the association among nighttime sleep and daytime napping behaviors, depressive symptoms, and perception of fatigue in pregnant women. Design: A prospective descriptive study with within-subject design. Setting: A university-affiliated hospital and participants’ home environments. Participants: Thirty-eight third trimester nulliparous women completed sleep and depressive symptom questionnaires, wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 consecutive days, and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent association. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Mean duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 ± 60.7 min, with 11 (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P = 0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day. Conclusions: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention effect.

AB  - Objective: To assess the association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with concurrent restless legs syndrome(RLS) and daytime sleepiness. We also prospectively examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4 years of follow-up. Methods: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional study of 65, 544 women (aged 41 = 58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had restless legs ≥5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review. Results: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS (15+ times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and 2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval[CI] 1.89-3.93), severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65 = 6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness(OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42) compared with women without MS. Among the 172 women who had MS and were free of RLS in 2005, 9 developed RLS (5.2%) during a 4-year period and all had severe RLS. The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 (95% CI 1.53- 8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS. Conclusion: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The validity of DSM symptoms for depression and anxiety disorders during pregnancy.
AU  - Matthey, Stephen
AU  - Ross-Hamid, Clodagh
T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties). Method: 118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy or due to her mood or worries. Results: 66% of pregnant women who met criteria for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety disorders appears to be less. Limitations: An important issue is whether women's attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood, such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints. Conclusion: Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population.

T2  - Journal of Biological Rhythms
AB  - The influence of circadian timekeeping systems on behavior and physiology can change substantially as female mammals undergo the transition from a nonpregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in extra-SCN oscillators and in local rhythms might coincide with the emergence of new patterns of temporal organization among various behavioral and physiological rhythms. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS and PER2 in 3 brain regions of pregnant and diestrous rats. We found that, in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BnST-ov), the peak of the PER2 rhythm occurred approximately 12 hours out of phase in pregnant and diestrous females. In contrast, the phase of the rhythm in FOS was the same, but pregnant rats expressed more FOS in the BnST-ov than diestrous ones. In the central amygdala (CEA) of diestrous females, PER2 expression was arrhythmic, but Fos expression was elevated at night. No rhythms were seen in this region of pregnant females, nor were any rhythms seen in the basolateral amygdala of either group. Overall, the patterns in the BnST-ov and the CEA were consistent with the hypothesis that differential changes in daily rhythms within some extra-SCN brain regions might mediate the changes in the temporal organization of several behavioral and endocrine functions that occur during the transition from a nonpregnant to a pregnant state.

TI  - Awake and asleep oxygen saturations in infants with chronic neonatal lung disease.
AU  - Sykes, Sarah
AU  - Kingshott, Ruth
AU  - Primhak, Robert
T2  - Acta Paediatrica
AB  - Aim: There is uncertainty about the best method of withdrawing supplemental oxygen in babies with chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD). Some authors advocate withdrawal of oxygen in the day, but continuing supplementation during sleep, based on early work suggesting that oxygen saturations are lower during sleep, which did not accord with our clinical impression. We re-examined the hypothesis that babies have lower saturations while asleep. Methods: We studied infants with CNLD during the day, while awake and asleep. We recorded video with simultaneous real-time capture of oxygen saturation (SpO₂), heart rate and plethysmographic waveform from pulse oximetry. Behavioural state was scored using observation and video and classified as awake (feeding, active or quiet) or sleep. Results: Thirteen infants had analysable data, although one had strikingly lower SpO₂ values while awake and was excluded from analysis. The infants had a median gestation of 26 weeks and were studied at a median (range) postmenstrual age of 66 (37–130) weeks, for 229 (89–330) min. Mean SpO₂ was 97.6% during sleep and 97.0% awake (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Babies with CNLD have lower oxygen saturation while awake. There is no physiological justification for increasing oxygen during sleep, or withdrawing selectively during the daytime, although larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.

AU  - Staff, Anne Cathrine
T2  - Acta Paediatrica
AB  - Reviews the book, Get me out—History of childbirth from the Garden of Eden to the sperm bank edited by R. H. Epstein (2011). This book presents a fascinating odyssey through shifting views and handling ⁄ control of fertility, pregnancy and obstetrical care. The book is devoted to the process of becoming pregnant, describing previous ideas and concepts of how a woman actually gets to carry a baby to today’s increasing use of sperm and egg donors, infertility treatment, surrogacy and egg preservation. The book covers a large variety of themes which includes changes in the understanding and prophylaxis of life-threatening puerperal fever, development of maternity wards, the strange concept of sleeping through delivery of the early 20th century, termed twilight sleep and changes in birth pain perception and care. A small objection to the book is that it reflects the author’s and her potential readers own situation and historical development. The book does not give a global perspective on how resources are allocated to achieve successful fertility and delivery. This varies throughout the world today and also within countries with large socioeconomic variations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: To determine the relationship between the working situation (full-time housewife, stopped working during pregnancy, or currently employed) and the lifestyle factors, reasons for stopping work during pregnancy, and effects of working conditions in order to identify the factors that are related to the continuation of employment among pregnant Japanese women. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to pregnant women who visited an obstetrics clinic in a Tokyo suburb for an outpatient medical check-up during July and August 2004. Results: The data of 530 healthy pregnant women were analyzed. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy had lower mental health scores than the full-time housewives and employed pregnant women. In each trimester, the employed pregnant women reported a shorter daytime sleep duration than the pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy and the full-time housewives. The reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were categorized as somatic symptoms due to pregnancy, working conditions, and a sense of values or social reasons. The employed women in the third trimester more often reported the availability of, and access to, a rest area in their company, compared to those in the first and second trimesters. Conclusion: The lifestyle factors of the pregnant women were different, based on their work situation. In particular, the employed pregnant women had a shorter daytime sleep duration. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy could have benefited from mental health support. In addition, the reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were different in the three trimesters. A flexible system is needed for working women that adapts to the physical changes that occur during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Background: There is a gap in the knowledge of longterm outcome of mild to moderate prematures compared to the extreme prematures or very low birth weight infants. Aim: Determine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in (pre-)school age children born at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation. Study design: A descriptive cohort study in a non-Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, treatment and social economic status (SES) were analyzed. Study tools were the TNO-AZL Preschool Quality of Life (TAPQoL) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Subjects: 362 children born between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation who had a follow-up evaluation at 2–5 years of age. Outcome measure: Health-related quality of life and the occurrence of emotional and behavioral problems. Results: Main characteristics (mean ± SD) were: gestation 34.7 ± 1 weeks and birth weight 2360 ± 444 g. Most families were two-parent middle-class households with parents employed at their educational level. Questionnaire response rate was 62.7%. The 12-item TAPQoL showed significantly lower scores for stomach and liveliness, while scores for behavior, communication and sleep were significantly higher compared to the general population. The TAPQoL subscale score for lung problems was significantly lower for children who had received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CBCL scores were within the validated normal range although the study-population scored higher on emotionally reactive, somatic complaints and attention problems compared to their full-term peers. Conclusion: Children born at 32 to 36 weeks' gestational age do not experience an overall lower HR-QoL at 2 to 5 years of age. CPAP results in lower HRQoL scores for lung problems. The overall occurrence of behavioral and emotional problems does not differ from the general term-born pediatric population. Several subitems need further attention.

AB  - Objective: The etiology of preterm birth (PTB) is likely caused by multiple factors, which may include disturbed sleep. We evaluated whether sleep disturbance was associated with PTB and whether the association was affected by other psychosocial risk factors. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 217) for whom we had depression and sleep data at 20 or 30 weeks gestation and delivery information were evaluated. Logistic models were used to test the hypotheses that disturbed sleep was associated with PTB. Results: Time in bed at 20 weeks was significantly associated with risk for preterm delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.88). However, after controlling for depression/selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) status, history of PTB, age, employment, and marital status, this relationship was no longer significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI .92-1.71). No other relationships were significant. Conclusions: We report preliminary evidence suggesting that poor sleep may contribute to risk for PTB. Although it is speculative and additional work is needed to confirm or refute whether sleep is an independent or mediating risk factor for PTB, disturbed sleep does appear to play a role in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

T2  - Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research
AB  - Study Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health priority and the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Several risk factors have been identified, but a gap in the understanding of the underlying etiology of PTB persists. Poor sleep quality is a correlate of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated whether sleep quality during pregnancy was a clinically relevant risk factor for PTB. Design: Observational Measurements and Results: Participants included 166 pregnant women (mean age = 28.6 ± 5.5 years). Self-report questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% CI [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% CI [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07). With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25% in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Poor sleep quality, in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed sleep contributes to PTB are unknown. We suggest that poor sleep may contribute to increased risk for PTB both independently, as well as in conjunction with other established risk factors, such as stress.

AB  - Background: Gestational hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Using laboratory-based polysomnography, we evaluated for the frequency of SDB in women with gestational hypertension compared to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: In this single-center cross-sectional study, women with the diagnosis of gestational hypertension were screened in the Fetal Assessment Unit and Antepartum ward. Healthy subjects were recruited by local advertising. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, followed by full night polysomnography. The primary outcome was frequency of SDB (defined as a respiratory disturbance index ≥ 5) in the gestational hypertension and healthy groups. Results: A total of 34 women with gestational hypertension and singleton pregnancies and 26 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies consented to participate in the study. The mean ages and gestational ages, but not the body mass indices, of the 2 groups were similar. The frequencies of SDB in the more obese gestational hypertension group and the healthy group were 53% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.001). Interpretation: Women with gestational hypertension may have a significantly higher frequency of SDB than do healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of similar gestational age. The relative causal contributions, if any, of SDB and obesity remain to be determined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

Finkbine confronts issues of reproductive choice as she learns that the tranquilizers she took as sleep aids have been shown to cause birth defects when taken during pregnancy. While she does not waiver on the decision to have an abortion, she struggles against the need for secrecy throughout the process. As she waits for the day of the termination to draw near, the media learn of Finkbine's decision to terminate the pregnancy and become a malingering, pervasive presence throughout the film. The Finkbine's must eventually travel overseas to have the pregnancy terminated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Depressed mothers' newborns are less responsive to animate and inanimate stimuli.
AU  - Field, Tiffany
AU  - Hernandez‐Reif, Maria
AU  - Diego, Miguel
T2  - Infant and Child Development
AB  - Data from our research are reviewed showing limited attentiveness and responsivity to animate stimuli in newborns of depressed mothers. These include face–voice stimuli of mothers and strangers, newborn cry sounds and instrumental and vocal music. Newborns of depressed mothers are also noted to be less attentive and responsive when presented with inanimate stimuli, including different texture nipples, different temperature nipples and different weight tubes. Potential underlying mechanisms are suggested by research showing negative effects of prenatal depression, elevated prenatal cortisol and lower prenatal dopamine and serotonin on the newborns of depressed mothers. Additional risk factors are explored, including sleep disturbances and other prenatal stressors. Early interventions, including pregnancy massage, massage therapy for infants and demonstration of the Brazelton Assessment, have been noted to enhance the neonates’ attentiveness and responsivity to animate and inanimate stimuli. Limitations of these studies are discussed, including the sample being limited to lower SES women who have many other problems that potentially affect newborns. More controlled studies are needed to assess potential mediating factors for the inferior performance of these newborns on perceptual tasks such as limited attentiveness and/or greater arousal as well as longitudinal follow-up studies to determine whether these limited perceptual abilities continue into infancy.

AB  - The current study explored the relationship between maternal subjective sleep quality and two factors that have been independently linked to maternal sleep: infant caretaking at night and maternal depressive symptom severity. Participants were a follow-up cohort of 94 women (mean age 33.3, SD = 4.4), who were depressed during pregnancy and part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Participants were evaluated 10 weeks after delivery, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and daily sleep logs for one week. On average, women woke to attend to the infant 2.2 times (SD = 1.1) and spent 47.3 min (SD =33.0) awake to attend to the infant. Regression analysis revealed that the number of times a woman’s sleep was disrupted by attending to her infant was a significant predictor of her perceived subjective sleep quality; however, the total amount of time she spent attending to her infant and her depressive symptom severity were not predictors. The findings of this study suggest that during the third postpartum month, sleep fragmentation appears more detrimental to maternal subjective sleep quality than amount of time awake during the night. This finding is relevant to the implementation of clinical interventions for improving maternal subjective sleep quality during the early postpartum period.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are modulated in a variety of peripheral tissues, including in the uterus where endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) undergo proliferation and differentiation (decidualization) during gestation. Here the authors focused on circadian rhythms in UESCs during implantation and decidualization in rodents. As revealed by analyses of cultured UESCs from pregnant Per2 promoter–dLuc transgenic rats, Per2 oscillation of ∼24h was observed in response to dexamethasone. Per2 oscillation was enhanced in UESCs during implantation, whereas they were attenuated during decidualization. In vivo studies showed that PER2 protein in the uteri displayed a peak at zeitberger time 4 (ZT 4) (day 4.50 of gestation) and a trough at ZT 12 (day 4.83), indicating its circadian rhythmicity. Conversely, no significant circadian rhythm of the PER2 protein was observed during decidualization. Fluorescent immunohistochemical studies also supported circadian rhythmicity of the PER2 protein in its intracellular distribution. In accordance with Per2 mRNA expression, a circadian rhythm of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) gene expression, having several E-box or E-box–like sites at the upstream of the transcription start site, was observed during implantation, showing a peak at ZT 0 and a trough at ZT 12. In contrast, Vegf mRNA expression displayed no circadian rhythm during decidualization. Collectively, the present results prove that Per2 oscillation is down-regulated in UESCs during decidualization. It is strongly suggested that cellular differentiation in UESCs interferes with circadian clockwork. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study compared the performances of pregnant women with education- and age-matched controls on a variety of measures that assessed perceptual speed, short-term and working memory capacity, subjective memory complaints, sleep quality, level of fatigue, executive functioning, episodic and prospective memory, and crystallized and fluid intelligence. A primary purpose was to test the hypothesis of Henry and Rendell (2007) that pregnancy-related declines in cognitive functioning would be especially evident in tasks that place a high demand on executive processes. We also investigated a parallel hypothesis: that the pregnant women would experience a broad-based reduction in cognitive capability. Very limited support was found for the executive functioning hypothesis. Pregnant women scored lower only on the measure of verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, COWAT) but not on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task or on any working memory measures. Furthermore, group differences in COWAT performance disappeared after controlling for verbal IQ (Shipley vocabulary). In addition, there was no support for the general decline hypothesis. We conclude that pregnancy-associated differences in performance observed in the current study were relatively mild and rarely reached either clinical or practical significance.

AB  - Objective: To develop and validate a prediction model for psychosocial problems in preadolescence using data on early developmental factors from routine Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH). Study design: The data come from the 1692 participants who take part in the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a longitudinal study. Information on early developmental factors (ages 0 to 4 years) was collected from the PCH file. Parents complete the Child Behavior Checklist when their child is age 11. To examine the predictive value of PCH-registered developmental factors on preadolescent problems, several multiple logistic regression analysis were performed, in a derivation sample (n = 1058). The predictive performance of the models was then assessed with area under the curve (AUC) in a validation sample (n = 643) to evaluate the validity of these models. Results: PCH-registered behavioral problems, attention/hyperactivity problems, enuresis, education level of the father, and being male were found to significantly predict externalizing problems (odds ratios [OR] between 1.4 and 3.7). Internalizing problems were predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, sleep problems, and being male (ORs between 1.7 and 3.0). The model for externalizing problems had a modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.72). However, for internalizing problems the AUC was 0.54 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.60), indicating poor discriminatory power. Conclusions: Findings on early development as registered by PCH are modestly predictive for externalizing problems in preadolescents, but only slightly for internalizing problems.

AB  - Introduction: This article is a review of literature data concerning the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by depressed pregnant women. Literature findings: The adverse effects for the foetus, the newborn and the child were evaluated. The prevalence of depression during pregnancy is of around 10 to 20% of the population of childbearing women. Depression is often misdiagnosed and underestimated in pregnant women. Starting a pharmacological treatment for depression in these women is not easy because data concerning the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy are still unclear. The non-treated pathology is associated with higher risk of maternal morbidity, including arterial hypertension, which could lead to preeclampsia or eclampsia, ideation and suicide attempts, and postpartum depression. Foetal development is also affected and adverse outcomes such as prematurity, low birth weight, irritability, and sleep disorders are frequent. Pharmacological therapy is necessary when non-pharmacological treatment is insufficient. Suicide attempts and relapse of depression have been described when depressive women stopped their pharmacological treatment during pregnancy. Pregnant women diagnosed with depression must be treated. Selective SSRIs are now largely used in this pathology and have replaced tricyclic antidepressants because of fewer side effects. In general, drugs have a low teratogenic potential, only 4 to 5% of malformations are iatrogenic. Teratogenic risk is high between conception until the end of the second month of gestation. Safety of SSRIs treatment during pregnancy and potential risk for the foetus and newborn were unquestioned before publication, in the late 2005, of some alarming data concerning a possible teratogenic effect. Studies showed an increased risk for all congenital malformations with SSRIs and particularly with paroxetin. A few studies after 2005 have also found an association between prenatal exposure to SSRIs (especially paroxetin) and congenital malformations. However, other studies failed to demonstrate this association and the risk for cardiovascular malformations also does not seem to be significantly increased. Numerous studies in pregnant women have shown that SSRI treatments are associated with a significant increase of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy has been associated with a three-fold increased risk of neonatal behavioural syndrome, including signs of withdrawal or serotonin impregnation. Restlessness, poor tone, respiratory distress, hypoglycaemia were the most frequent signs. These symptoms occur during the first days of life and are usually brief and not serious. Recent studies have also documented an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension and cases of cerebral haemorrhage have been described. Data concerning a possible effect on motor and cognitive development at school age in children prenatally exposed to SSRIs are limited. Discussion: Although a number of studies revealed that SSRIs are not teratogenic, some of them showed congenital malformations associated with use of these antidepressants; in particular an increased risk of cardiac defects with paroxetin. In practice, the potential risk implies that the decision to treat a pregnant woman with SSRIs (notably paroxetin) should be taken carefully; this means double-checking the diagnosis, the potential benefits, adverse effects and possible alternatives. Neonatal toxicity seems to be relatively frequent when SSRIs are prescribed during late pregnancy. For all depressed pregnant women, the severity of the depression must be taken into consideration before introducing a pharmacological treatment. When depressive women are already treated, studies have shown that antidepressants must be maintained during pregnancy to prevent relapse and suicide attempts.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate how the past experiences of mothers and their potentially traumatic events during pregnancy may have influenced the processes of psychobiological self-regulation and cognitive development in a child born preterm. Eighty children who had a gestational age of < 32 weeks were examined at the 9th month of the corrected age. The mothers and children were divided in two groups: multipara mothers and their children and the primipara mothers and their children. These children were examined on the basis of sleep disorders, nutritional problems and mental development. Perinatal data from clinical observations and data from standardized developmental tests (BSID, II ed.) were used to describe the differences. The children of primipara mothers who had unexpected preterm delivery presented major incidences of sleep disorders while the children of primipara mothers, who programmed preterm delivery, presented a major incidences of nutrition problems. The predictability of preterm delivery has a major influence on the capacity of newborns for self-regulation in the case of primipara mothers.

AB  - Hormone secretion often occurs in a pulsatile manner. In this review, we discuss two rhythms of in vivo prolactin release in female rats and the ongoing research that we and others have performed aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying them. The peptide hormone oxytocin appears to play an important role in both rhythms. One rhythm occurs during the first half of pregnancy, but can also be induced in ovariectomised rats. This is characterised by a circadian pattern with two prolactin surges per day. Two methods for triggering this rhythm are discussed, each utilising a unique physiological pathway that includes oxytocin action, presumably on pituitary lactotrophs. The second rhythm occurs during the oestrous cycle and is characterised by a surge of prolactin on the afternoon of pro-oestrus. We discuss recent findings that oxytocin is more effective at stimulating prolactin release from lactotrophs taken from animals on the afternoon of pro-oestrus than from those of animals on the morning of dioestrus 1, raising the possibility that this hormone plays a physiological role in the regulation of prolactin secretion during the oestrous cycle.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to investigate if insomnia in late pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology/postpartum depression (PPD). 581 women in their last trimester of pregnancy answered questions/questionnaires about lifetime history of insomnia, current sleep perception, current mood and depressive symptomatology. They were interviewed with the Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. After delivery 382 (65.7%) mothers participated again in the study. Insomnia in pregnancy was not a risk factor for PPD (DSM-IV or ICD-10) but was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Negative Affect (NA) was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Women with higher NA were 4.6 (CI95% = 1.69–12.74) and 5.3 times (CI95% = 2.26–12.58) more likely of experiencing PPD (DSM-IV/ICD-10, respectively) than women with lower NA. Lifetime Depression was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology and ICD-10/PPD (OR = 2.6; CI95% = 1.16–4.38). Positive Affect (PA) showed to be a protective factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology and DSM-IV/PPD (OR = 1.5; CI95% = 1.20–2.33). Controlling NA, PA and Lifetime Depression, insomnia lost its predictive role, suggesting these variables might work as mediators. Associations between insomnia, NA, PA and Lifetime Depression should be assessed in pregnancy. This might help to preventively target NA, enhance PA and reduce the likelihood of experiencing postpartum depressive symptomatology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study aimed to document self-perceived warning signs, initial symptoms, and triggers of epileptic seizures and techniques to control seizures for people with epilepsy, and to establish patterns in these self-reported experiences of epilepsy in relation to age, gender and seizure type. Of the 338 people with epilepsy who had registered interest in participating in social research, 225 returned a self-report questionnaire (66% response rate) that contained information regarding demographic characteristics, living with epilepsy, and self-perceived warning signs, initial symptoms, triggers of seizures and techniques to control seizures. Of 225 respondents, 195 (86.6%) experienced at least one initial symptom prior to a seizure and 202 (89.8%) experienced at least one seizure trigger. Gender analysis of triggers revealed that females differed from males regarding seizures triggered by low blood sugar, dieting, fasting, touch and female specific triggers (menstruation, pregnancy and ovulation). Respondents reported tiredness as the most frequent trigger (65.3%), followed by stress (64%) and sleep deprivation (55.1%). Many respondents (63.6%) reported that they could predict seizure occurrence, with 91 (40.4%) also indicating that family members could predict seizure occurrence. A total of 157 (69.8%) respondents had tried at least one of 12 possible seizure avoidance techniques, with resting and medication the most frequently reported. Finding that respondents were able to recognise warning signs, initial symptoms and triggers of seizures, and some were able to stop seizures provides scope for developing interventions, such as promoting avoidance of high risk triggers, which supplement existing treatments of epilepsy.

AB  - Objectives: To fully ascertain the familial aggregation of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and to characterize the clinical features of familial RLS (fRLS) cases. Design: A case series survey with a high response rate. Setting: Academic research center. Participants: Consecutive RLS probands (n = 249) were followed up in a specialized sleep center for 15 years. A total of 671 cases of fRLS met the current standard diagnostic criteria, including 192 probands characterized using multidimensional clinical assessments and 479 affected family members assessed by their responses to a structured questionnaire telephone diagnostic interview. Main Outcome Measures: Sibling and offspring relative risk ratio and clinical and genetic features of patients with fRLS and families. Results: Our data showed that RLS aggregates in families with a familial rate of 77%, a sibling relative risk of 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-4.4), and an offspring relative risk of 1.8 (1.0-2.7). Familial RLS is a chronic disorder with amean (SD) disease duration of 24(16) years and a wide range of age of onset (mean [SD], 28[15] years), with most family members having early-onset disease but mild to moderate RLS symptoms. Our clinical data also indicated that fRLS is more prominent among women who also had increased incidence of anemia/iron deficiency, arthritis, and number of pregnancies. Pregnancy-related RLS seems to be a characteristic feature of fRLS, and afflicted women tend to have a much younger age of onset. Conclusions: Restless legs syndrome significantly aggregated in families with variable phenotypic expressivity, and the siblings of severely affected individuals have an increased risk of developing the disease.

AB  - Postpartum weight retention plays an important role in the pathway leading to obesity among women of childbearing age. The objective of this study was to examine predictors of moderate (1–10 pounds) and high (>10 pounds) postpartum weight retention using data from a prospective pregnancy cohort that followed women into the postpartum period; n = 688 and 550 women at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Analysis included descriptive statistics and predictive modeling using log-binomial techniques. The average weight retained at 3 and 12 months postpartum in this population was 9.4 lb (s.d. = 11.4) and 5.7 lb (s.d. = 13.2), respectively. At 3 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and hours slept during the night were associated with moderate or high weight retention, whereas having an infant hospitalized after going home and scoring in the upper 75th percentile of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) were associated only with high weight retention. At 12 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and maternal education were associated with moderate weight retention; and gestational weight gain, maternal age, race, employment status, and having an infant hospitalized at birth were associated with high weight retention. The results of this study illustrate the importance of prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain in predicting postpartum weight retention. Furthermore, given the lack of successful intervention studies that exist to date to help women lose weight in the postpartum period, the results of this study may help to inform future interventions that focus on such aspects as hours of sleep, dealing with stress associated with a hospitalized infant, and nonclinical eating disorder symptomatology.

AB  - Atypical and melancholic subtypes of depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV are important concepts, especially for biological psychiatry. The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions. The possible therapeutic consequences and the neurobiological basis for these findings warrant further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Few studies have examined relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring beyond very early childhood. Eighty-five women classified as high risk for major depressive disorder during pregnancy completed measures of mood and their child’s sleep 4–7 years postpartum. Mothers with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores ≥20 reported more sleep problems in their child, and child sleep disruption was a reasonable predictor of maternal BDI-II. More research is needed to determine causal relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2009-05631-016). Using a nationwide population-based dataset, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between paternal schizophrenia and the risk of low birth weight (LBW). This study linked the 2001 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Data set with Taiwan’s birth and death certificate registries. In total, 220 465 singleton live births were included. The key dependent variable was whether or not an infant’s father was diagnosed with schizophrenia, while the independent variable of interest was whether an infant had LBW. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between paternal schizophrenia and the risk of LBW, after adjusting for the infant and parents’ characteristics. The results show that infants whose fathers had schizophrenia were more likely to have LBW than those whose fathers did not (12.6% vs 8.0%). Infants whose fathers had schizophrenia were found to be 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.10–2.52, P < .05) times more likely to have LBW than their counterparts whose fathers did not have schizophrenia, following adjustment for gestational week at birth, parity, paternal age and highest educational level, family monthly incomes, and marital status. We conclude that the offspring whose fathers had a diagnosis of schizophrenia had increased risk of LBW compared with those whose fathers had no schizophrenia. This finding paves the way for further studies and suggests that there may be potential benefit to early intervention to prevent LBW in pregnant women with husbands with schizophrenia.

AB  - All adult mammals examined thus far exhibit sleep bout durations that follow an exponential distribution and wake bout durations that follow a power-law distribution. In altricial rodents such as rats and mice, exponential distributions of sleep bouts are found soon after birth, but the power-law distribution of wake bouts does not emerge until the third postnatal week. Also, both sleep and bouts consolidate across the early postnatal period. It is not known whether similar developmental processes occur in precocial species during the prenatal period. Here we characterize sleep–wake development in a precocial species, the domestic sheep (Ovis aries), from 114 to 148 days gestational age (DGA). Sleep and wake bout durations exhibited exponential distributions throughout the fetal period with some evidence of an emerging exponential-to-power-law transition for wake bouts toward the end of gestation. Both sleep and wake bouts consolidated in an orderly fashion across development and there was little evidence of circadian variation, even in the oldest subjects. These results indicate that similar patterns of sleep–wake organization are found prenatally in a precocial species as are found postnatally in altricial species. Data from more species are needed to fully realize the benefits of a developmental comparative approach for understanding the forces that have shaped the ontogeny and phylogeny of mammalian sleep.

AB  - Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and social behavior deficits in adolescents and adults that have experienced prenatal exposure to adverse conditions. This study investigated whether sleep deprivation during the pre-implantation stage of development alters the physiological, behavioral and oxidative metabolic processes in adult male mouse offspring. One group of dams was continuously sleep-deprived using the platform technique from gestational days 0 to 3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep-deprived by gentle handling for 6h on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH 2) or 3 (GH 3). After sleep deprivation, homocysteine, cysteine, corticosterone, estrogen and progesterone concentrations were measured from the experimental mothers and time-matched controls. The sizes and weights of the male pups were measured at various stages throughout the experiment. At PND 90, behavioral (Activity Box and Elevated Plus Maze) and biochemical parameters were assessed. The dams’ plasma progesterone concentrations decreased in the PSD 72 group, and the levels of plasma estradiol increased in GH 2. Corticosterone levels were found to increase after all sleep-deprivation procedures. Homocysteine concentrations increased in the GH 2 but decreased in the PSD 72 group. The offspring of GH 1 mothers exhibited decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Exposure to sleep deprivation had a long-lasting impact on tissue weight; in particular, there was a decrease in hemilateral epididymal fat weight in mature animals from the PSD 72 group. Although some of the alterations observed in the mothers (elevated estrogen and corticosterone levels and decreased progesterone) might have played a role in the permanent alterations in the adult offspring, they were not the main cause. The homocysteine changes detected in the sleep-deprived dams may contribute to redox changes, controlling gene expression and shaping epigenetic development.

TI  - Cognitive performance of pregnant and postpartum women with and without major depression.
AU  - Nowakowski, Sara
AB  - Keenan and colleagues (1998) have demonstrated that episodic memory is diminished during pregnancy and returns to baseline in the postpartum period. Given that memory deficits may occur in major depression, possible memory deficits during pregnancy could be exacerbated by major depression. The present study examined memory performance in 37 pregnant women, 14 of whom met clinical criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and 23 normal control (NC) pregnant women who had no current or prior history of depression. Additionally, postpartum groups consisted of 21 postpartum women, 11 of whom met clinical criteria for a MDE, and 10 NC postpartum women. The study utilized a 2 x 2 Multivariate Analysis of Variance design to compare memory performance and sleep of pregnant and postpartum women with and without major depression. The study demonstrated that pregnancy and major depression were both associated with poorer performance in a task involving verbal learning and memory. Specifically, on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), pregnant women learned significantly fewer words from trials one through five; recalled significantly fewer words on trial one, short delay free and cued recall, and long delay free and cued recall; and utilized a semantic clustering strategy significantly fewer than postpartum women. Depressed patients learned significantly fewer words from trials one through five, recalled significantly fewer words on CVLT long delay free recall, and utilized a semantic clustering strategy significantly fewer than NC women. No alterations in outcomes of the above analyses were found when age, education, weeks pregnant/postpartum, or circadian preference were applied as covariates. The present results are consistent with previous investigations of memory functioning of major depressive disorder and healthy pregnant and postpartum women. That is, pregnant and depressed women exhited poorer performance in tasks involving verbal learning and memory compared with postpartum and NC women.

AB  - Study Objectives: We evaluated the influence of maternal self-reported habitual sleep duration during early pregnancy on blood pressure (BP) levels and risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Clinic-based study. Participants: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women. Measurements and Results: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated. Mean 1st and 2nd trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar among women reporting to be short sleepers (≤6 h) vs. women reporting to sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy were associated with increased mean 3rd trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 3rd trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting ≤6 h and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean 3rd trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (≥10 h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (<5 h) and long (≥10 h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for PE. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with a larger literature that documents elevated blood pressure and increased risks of hypertension with short and long sleep duration.

AB  - We studied the effects of adverse conditions such as constant light (LL) on the circadian rhythm of malate (MDH, EC 1.1.1.37) and lactate (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) dehydrogenase activities of the testes of male Wistar rats on postnatal day 28 (PN28), anxietylike behavior (elevated plus-maze test) at PN60 and sexual behavior at PN120. The rats were assigned to mother groups on day 10 of pregnancy: control (12-h light/dark), LL (light from day 10 to 21 of pregnancy), and LL+Mel (LL and sc injection to the mothers of a daily dose of melatonin, 1 mg/kg body weight at circadian time 12, from day 17 to 21 of pregnancy). LL offspring did not show circadian rhythms of MDH (N = 62) and LDH (N = 63) activities (cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher). They presented a 44.7% decrease in open-arm entries and a 67.9% decrease in time (plus-maze test, N = 15, P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test), an increase in mounting (94.4%), intromission (94.5%) and ejaculation (56.6%) latencies (N = 12, P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test) and lower numbers of these events (61, 59 and 73%, respectively; P < 0.01, N = 12) compared to controls. The offspring of the LL+Mel group presented MDH and LDH circadian rhythms (P < 0.05, N = 50, cosinor and ANOVA-LSD Fisher), anxiety-like and sexual behaviors similar to control. These findings supported the importance of the melatonin signal and provide evidence for the protective effects of hormones on maternal programming during gestation. This protective action of melatonin is probably related to its entrainment capacity, favoring internal coupling of the fetal multioscillatory system.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between pregnancy physical discomforts experienced during the second trimester and late pregnancy depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effect of sleep quality on antenatal depressive symptomatology. Healthy pregnant women (N = 257) completed the Physical Symptoms Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Inventory at early–mid second trimester, and then again at late third trimester. Physical symptoms and sleep quality at the first time point were both correlated moderately with depressive symptoms at late pregnancy. Discomfort associated with physical symptoms was a better predictor of depressive symptoms than Frequency of symptoms, although a score combining Frequency, Discomfort and Effect of symptoms on life was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms. Results of the hierarchical regression analyses of the mediation model indicated that physical symptoms at early–mid second trimester predicted depressive symptoms in the last trimester both directly, and via poor sleep quality (prospectively), which mediated the relationship. The clinical implications of these findings for antenatal care are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - European Journal of Neuroscience
AB  - Adult neurogenesis occurs in two privileged microenvironments, the hippocampal subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) along the lateral ventricle. This review focuses on accumulating evidence suggesting that the activity of specific brain regions or bodily states influences SVZ cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin have been shown to have long-range effects through neuronal projections into the SVZ. Local γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate signaling have demonstrated effects on SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis, but an extra-niche source of these neurotransmitters remains to be explored and options will be discussed. There is also accumulating evidence that diseases and bodily states such as Alzheimer’s disease, seizures, sleep and pregnancy influence SVZ cell proliferation. With such complex behavior and environmentally-driven factors that control subregion-specific activity, it will become necessary to account for overlapping roles of multiple neurotransmitter systems on neurogenesis when developing cell therapies or drug treatments.

T2  - Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics
AB  - CASE: Gerardo is an 8-year-old Latino boy who saw his primary care pediatrician with a second asthma exacerbation this year. His frustration with his illness was immediately apparent when he said, “I hate having to go to the nurse’s office to take my albuterol!” His mother expressed concern that her son frequently refused to take his prevention medication for asthma, montelukast, each morning. When questioned about compliance with his inhaled steroid, his mother hesitated and then admitted that she discontinued the controller medication because she is afraid to “poison his body with so many chemicals.” She consistently gave her son the inhaled steroid for 12 months, until care by the allergy specialist was unexpectedly transferred to a Spanish-speaking allergist. She complained that the new doctor is “cold and acts like a veterinarian, not a pediatrician.” Gerardo is a first generation Mexican-American who was born in the United States to Spanish-speaking parents. There is no family history of asthma, although his mother fears that she may have contributed to Gerardo’s condition. She explained that during pregnancy, she worked cleaning houses where she was exposed to many toxic household cleaners. She has always worried that by inhaling these fumes during pregnancy, she induced her son’s asthma. Gerardo presented with his first episode of reactive airway disease at 9 months of age. His mother vividly recalled his high temperature, rapid breathing, and their ambulance ride to the hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days, and he has not been hospitalized since. Allergy testing revealed sensitivity to weed pollen only. Gerardo sleeps with a nonallergenic pillow and bed cover. Gerardo’s mother explained that 3 days before his current exacerbation, he was playing at an amusement park with his friends on a hot day. Gerardo and his friends ran through a large fountain. His mother reported that he was soaked in water and stated, “He knows that he will get sick with asthma if he gets wet!” She recalled that 3 years ago at a friend’s birthday party, Gerardo abstained from running through the sprinklers with the other children without instruction from his parents. Since that event, she has trusted Gerardo to care for his “weak lungs.” She is frustrated now with his regression in self-care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Use of malaria prevention and control measures during pregnancy in Jinja, Uganda.
AU  - Sangare, Laura R.
AB  - Maternal malaria is associated with serious adverse pregnancy outcomes. Established means of preventing malaria during pregnancy include intermittent presumptive therapy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) and sleeping under an insecticide treated net (ITN). We sought to identify determinants of preventive use of SP and ITNs during pregnancy among recently pregnant women in Uganda. Additionally, the schedule for administering SP at antenatal care (ANC) visits was determined as was the degree to which self-reported malaria episodes were treated with a recommended antimalarial Utilizing a population-based random sample, we interviewed women living in Jinja, Uganda who had been pregnant in the past year. Among 500 participants, 99% attended at least 1 ANC visit, and 68% were offered SP at least once for prevention. Among women who were offered SP for prevention, 98% of them used it, compared to only 4% of those who were never offered SP (RR: 25.6; 95% CI: 10.9, 60.6). However, SP was administered as directed by the Ugandan guidelines in only 38.6% of women. ITNs were owned by 384 women (77%), of whom 71% reported they always slept under the ITN during pregnancy. Women who owned more than 1 net were slightly more likely to always use one (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), whereas women living in wealthier households were less likely than those in the poorest households (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.97) to always use a net. These observations suggest that women will use SP if provided during ANC, so improving healthcare providers' knowledge about the proper use and administration of SP ought to improve uptake. In contrast, we were unable to pinpoint why a sizable fraction of Ugandan women did not always adhere to recommendations for use of an ITN during pregnancy. In a separate analysis confined to women who reported being treated for an illness believed to be malaria, an antimalarial drug was used to treat 85% of the 637 self-reported episodes. However, only 5.6% of first trimester episodes and 50.2% of second/third trimester episodes were treated with a recommended antimalarial. A contraindicated antimalarial drug was involved in 70% of first trimester episodes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This book presents the treatment "roadmap" implemented by the University of Michigan Comprehensive Depression Center's Treatment Resistant Depression Program, step-by-step guidance that has long eluded clinicians, patients, and their families. Writing across discipline, modality, lifespan, and patient demographics, the authors have compiled the most current thinking on TRD. The authors believe that early intervention is critical, and they advocate strategies for renewed focus on identifying youths who are at risk or already symptomatic. Similarly, they devote chapters to special populations such as pregnant women, older people, and those with comorbidities. Perhaps most useful to patients and their families, the book has a strong self-care orientation, emphasizing the importance of exercise, nutrition, and healthy sleep guidelines. Patients who are actively engaged in managing their disease often have better outcomes. Treatment Resistant Depression is frequently a lifetime diagnosis. The book acknowledges that fact and offers a systematic course of treatment grounded in evidence-based research that is current and comprehensive. Treatment Resistant Depression: A Roadmap for Effective Care offers a new way of conceptualizing an old enemy, and should prove to be an indispensable weapon in the battle.

AB  - Objective: Animal studies have shown sex differences in the impact of prenatal maternal stress on the offspring. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to assess the effect of prenatal depression on newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables. Method: We screened 205 pregnant women from April 2004 to November 2006 for depressive symptoms. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group (n = 34) was based on meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded postnatal depression from the control group (n = 79) by routine screening at 2 and 6 months. Newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, respectively. Results: Despite our use of numerous exclusion criteria (eg, at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery), prenatal depression highly correlated with anxiety and stress scores. Male newborns of mothers with prenatal depression had lower scores than controls on the motor skills and regulation of states NBAS clusters (P = .03 and P = .026, respectively). At 1 year, infants of prenatally depressed mothers presented higher scores on generalized anxiety (P = .002), particularly in males (P = .009); activity/impulsivity (P = .042); and sleep problems (P = .023) than controls. Conclusions: As in animal studies, depression during pregnancy may affect infant development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed to be associated with depression, stress, and anxiety during pregnancy may be a key to understanding the higher prevalence in males of child psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced by women during the perinatal period. Changes in sleep and sleep quality are typical throughout pregnancy and early postpartum. However, little is known about relationships between insomnia symptoms and psychiatric symptoms in perinatal women. The objective of the present study is to characterize the burden of insomnia symptoms in perinatal women seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment and to examine relationships between insomnia and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: Data from 257 pregnant or postpartum women who sought outpatient psychiatric treatment at a university hospital-affiliated clinic were extracted from an existing clinical management database. Data included validated self-report measures assessing insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), mood (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), and generalized anxiety (Penn State Worry Questionnaire [PSWQ]). Results: Fifty-two percent of women reported symptoms of insomnia, 75% reported symptoms of depression, and 61% reported symptoms of generalized anxiety. After controlling for PSWQ, the partial correlation between EPDS and ISI was 0.15 and 0.37 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. After controlling for EPDS, the partial correlation between PSWQ and ISI was 0.20 and 0.12 for pregnant and postpartum women, respectively. Women with clinically significant ISI scores had significantly higher odds for reporting symptoms consistent with depression (odds ratio [OR] 7.7) and generalized anxiety (OR 2.55) compared to women with lower ISI scores. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms affected a significant proportion of the perinatal women in this sample. These symptoms are linked to symptoms of depression and anxiety in treatment-seeking pregnant and postpartum women. Perinatal women seen in psychiatric treatment settings should be routinely screened for sleep problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study assessed whether elevated severities of maternal depression and disturbed maternal sleep would be associated with maternal perceptions of higher Negative Affectivity of her infant. Sixty-nine mothers participated in this study. The study was part of a larger randomized controlled study testing the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for depression during pregnancy. The present study focused on data collected at 6 months postpartum in a naturalistic follow-up design, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), maternal sleep diaries (completed daily for 1 week), and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R).Regression analyses revealed that (a) maternal depression severity was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Distress and Falling Reactivity scales and (b) poor maternal sleep was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Sadness scale.Our findings support previous findings of significant links between maternal emotional distress and perceived Negative Affectivity of her infant's temperament and provide a novel insight linking maternal poor sleep with perceived sadness of the infant.

TI  - Exposure of pregnant rats to restricted feeding schedule synchronizes the SCN clocks of their fetuses under constant light but not under a light-dark regime.

T2  - Journal of Biological Rhythms
AB  - The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) develops gradually during the prenatal and early postnatal period. In the rat, this period lasts from around the 15th day of gestation until the 10th day of postnatal development. The circadian system of fetuses and newborn pups is entrained mostly by nonphotic maternal cues during prenatal and early postnatal development. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether exposure of pregnant rats to a restricted feeding (RF) regime was able to entrain the circadian clock in the SCN of their fetuses during the prenatal period. The potency of RF as an entraining cue was tested under conditions when pregnant rats were entrained to an external light/dark (LD) cycle as well as under conditions when the external timing signal was lacking, i.e., under constant light (LL). The control groups were fed ad libitum and the experimental groups had restricted access to food for 6 h during their resting time throughout pregnancy. Daily profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression were examined by in situ hybridization in the SCN of 1-day-old pups. The data demonstrated that RF in pregnant rats kept under LD cycle did not notably affect the daily rhythms of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of pups. The SCN profiles of Avp and c-fos gene expression did not exhibit circadian rhythms in pups born to mothers maintained in LL and fed ad libitum, likely due to desynchrony among the pups within a litter. However, RF in the pregnant rats kept under LL restored the circadian rhythmicity of c-fos and Avp expression in the SCN of their newborn pups. The results suggest that the fetal SCN clock is dominantly entrained by rhythmic signals from the maternal SCN. However, under conditions when the rhythmic signaling might be lacking, such as LL, regular food intake of the mothers may also play an important role in synchronization of the fetal SCN clock during prenatal ontogenesis.

AB  - Background: Stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the course of pregnancy and on fetal development. There are few studies investigating the outcome of stress reduction interventions on maternal well-being and obstetric outcome. Aims: This study aims (1) to obtain fetal behavioral states (quiet/active sleep, quiet/active wakefulness), (2) to investigate the effects of maternal relaxation on fetal behavior as well as on uterine activity, and (3) to investigate maternal physiological and endocrine parameters as potential underlying mechanisms for maternal–fetal relaxation–transferral. Study design: The behavior of 33 fetuses was analyzed during laboratory relaxation/quiet rest (control group, CG) and controlled for baseline fetal behavior. Potential associations between relaxation/quiet rest and fetal behavior (fetal heart rate (FHR), FHR variation, FHR acceleration, and body movements) and uterine activity were studied, using a computerized cardiotocogram (CTG) system. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol, and norepinephrine were measured. Results: Intervention (progressive muscle relaxation, PMR, and guided imagery, GI) showed changes in fetal behavior. The intervention groups had higher long-term variation during and after relaxation compared to the CG (p = .039). CG fetuses had more FHR acceleration, especially during and after quiet rest (p = .027). Women in the PMR group had significantly more uterine activity than women in the GI group (p = .011) and than CG women. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones were not associated with fetal behavior. Conclusions: This study indicates that the fetus might participate in maternal relaxation and suggests that GI is superior to PMR. This could especially be true for women who tend to direct their attention to body sensations such as abdominal activity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: The goals of this study were to assess: (a) the involvement of fathers and mothers in overall and nighttime infant caregiving; (b) the links between paternal involvement in infant care and infant sleep patterns during the first 6 months. Methods: Fifty-six couples recruited during their first pregnancy, participated in the study. After delivery (1 and 6 months), both parents completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. Infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Results: Mothers were significantly more involved than fathers in daytime and nighttime caregiving. A higher involvement of fathers in overall infant care predicted and was associated with fewer infant night-wakings and with shorter total sleep time after controlling for breastfeeding. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of including fathers in developmental sleep research. Future studies should explore mechanisms underlying the relations between paternal involvement and infant sleep. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology
AB  - Comments on an article by Annemarie M. Visser et al. (see record 2010-22379-012). In their population based study Visser et al. have sought to provide further information regarding the relative incidence of epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysmal events in infancy, exploring associations with prenatal and perinatal factors. The authors have defined paroxysmal events as 'suddenly occurring, mostly short lasting events, with altered consciousness, altered behavior, involuntary movements, altered muscle tone, and a changed breathing pattern alternating with periods during which the symptoms did not occur'. An interesting finding of this study was that preterm birth and low Apgar scores at 1 minute were significantly associated with these events. However, as the authors indicate, a major confounding factor is the possibility that parents of infants who have had a complicated perinatal course are more likely to report events. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and preterm birth were significantly associated with febrile seizures in the first year of life but numbers were small. Episodes during sleep were included in the study but may be difficult to detect reliably since infants are much more likely to be observed closely while awake. Thus, the paper by Visser et al. gives some insight into various paroxysmal disorders by subdividing the disorders into broad categories. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Late-preterm and full-term infant sleep: Relations with maternal cognitions and nocturnal behaviors.
AU  - Young, Marion E.
AB  - Approximately 13% of infants born in the United States each year are delivered prematurely, defined as prior to 37 weeks gestation. Among these premature infants, 84% are born between 32 and 36 weeks gestation (Kelly, 2006). Past research has found that the sleep/wake patterns of late-preterm and full-term infants are different (Gossel-Symank, Grimmer, Korte, & Siegmund, 2004; Ingersoll & Thoman, 1999; Ju et al., 1991). However, little is known about psychosocial factors (i.e., maternal sleep-related cognitions and nocturnal behaviors) that may contribute to differences between late-preterm and full-term infant sleep. Few studies have investigated the relations among infant sleep behavior, mothers’ cognitions about infant sleep, and mothers’ sleep-related behaviors in mothers of full-term and late-preterm infants. Information about these relations might contribute to an understanding of why late-preterm infants might sleep less well than full-term infants. Results of this study indicated that while not extensive, a few sleep differences do exist between late-preterm and full-term infants at 6 months of age, with late-preterm infants sleeping more during the day than full-term infants. However, relations between infant sleep and maternal cognitions and nocturnal behaviors are less clear. The current sample of late-preterm infant mothers did not endorse cognitions nor participate in nocturnal behaviors that had been previously associated with poorer infant sleep patterns. In some cases, full-term infant mothers were more likely to report certain cognitions (e.g., doubt) than late-preterm infant mothers. This could be related to the psychopathology that was reported in the current sample of full-term infant mothers, including depression. However, late-preterm infant mothers were more vigilant at night than full-term infant mothers, supporting the idea of a slight maternal expectation of infant vulnerability. Maternal expectations of premature infants in general were also not different between groups with late-preterm infant mothers actually rating unfamiliar full-term infants less favorably than unfamiliar premature labeled infants. While contradictory to what was hypothesized, the findings are in line with research supporting the idea that positive experiences the mothers have had with their own infants would override any negative beliefs held about premature infants. Finally, maternal expectations of infant development also did not differ as was hypothesized. In fact, mothers in the entire sample tended to be accurate reporters of their infant’s developmental abilities. The development of sleep is one of the most important and dramatic processes of infancy and early childhood. The development of sleep/wake patterns in premature infants as an area of research is one that is sparse and the results incongruent. Research investigating sleep in late-premature infants is even less available. Thus, while the current study did not yield a wide range of significant results it is an important first step in continuing to understand the development of sleep patterns in late-premature infants.

AB  - Objective: To examine the adverse psychology and behaviors in pregnant women with different types of behavior and try to provide evidences for the psychological intervention among them. Methods: Totally 1789 pregnant women were selected by convenience sampling and were classified into different types according to the Type A Behavior Pattern Scale (TABS). Their symptoms of depression and anxiety, and coping style were evaluated with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire ( SCSQ). The life events, suicide related psychology and behaviors, self-harm behaviors, and excessive drinking were assessed with the self-made questionnaires. Results: The rates of type A behavior, partial type A behavior, middle type behavior, partial type B behavior, and type B behavior were 2.9%, 19.2%, 4.9%, 40.8% and 32.2%, respectively. The scores of self-rating working pressure, quality of sleep, depression, anxiety, negative coping style, and the number of adverse life events had positive correlation with the scores of TABS (r = 0.08-0.34, P r = -0.09, P Ps < 0.01). Conclusion: The rates of adverse psychology and behaviors in pregnant women with typical type A behavior or partial type A behavior may be higher than others. More concerns should be strengthened to those pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Chronobiology International
AB  - Pain exhibits temporal variations in intensity due to multiple factors, including endogenous neuroendocrine and various external influences that vary over the 24h. Also, medications can vary in potency and/or toxicity according to the time when they are administered. However, there is no consensus among studies regarding the 24-h pattern of analgesia during labor. Taking into account the time-of-day when labor analgesia is administered, this study aimed to answer two questions: (i) Is there diurnal variation in visual analogue scale (VAS)–rated pain relief and duration of intrathecal analgesia in patients undergoing labor analgesia? (ii) If there is, what is the influence of the duration of labor on the diurnal variation of the level of pain relief and duration of intrathecal analgesia? This prospective cohort included 41 healthy, nulliparous women in the first stage of labor undergoing spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia using fentanyl combined with bupivacaine. Subjects had an epidural catheter fitted for additional, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) if their pain relief was unsatisfactory. The number of VAS assessments (n=558) was divided into six time periods of the 24h. The adjusted coefficient of determination (r²), the proportion of the variance explained by the association between the duration of labor and the temporal pattern of the outcomes variable, was 58% (r²=0.58) for pain relief and 44% (r²=0.44) for duration of intrathecal analgesia. The peak effect of labor analgesia occurred between 02:00 and 05:59h. However, the duration of intrathecal analgesia showed two peaks, i.e., at ∼00:00 and ∼12:00h. These results demonstrate that labor analgesia achieved by fentanyl combined with bupivacaine shows a diurnal pattern in pain relief and duration of spinal analgesia. However, part of these temporal patterns was explained by the association with duration of labor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased inflammatory cytokines are all associated with the risk for postpartum major depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence. Methods: Participants were pregnant women (N = 56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores ≥15 and clinician interview. Results: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p < .05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (Χ² = 0.98, p = .32). Conclusions: Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted.

AB  - Converging evidence indicates that pregnant women report experiencing problems with memory, but the results of studies using objective measures are ambiguous. The present study investigated potential reason(s) for the discrepancy between findings of subjective and objective memory deficits, as well as potential source(s) of pregnant women's problems with memory. Sixty-one pregnant and 24 nonpregnant women completed a series of memory tests which included field and laboratory measures of prospective memory. Three standardized questionnaires were used to assess subjective aspects of memory. The influence of cortisol, depressed mood, anxiety, physical symptoms, sleep/fatigue, and busyness on pregnancy-related deficits was also examined. The findings revealed objective pregnancy-related deficits on two of the field measures of prospective memory. Pregnancy-related subjective deficits were also detected on all of the questionnaires. In contrast, no objective pregnancy-related deficits were found on the laboratory measures of memory. Increased physical symptoms accounted for one of the objective deficits in memory, while depressed mood and physical symptoms accounted for two of the subjective memory deficits. Collectively, these findings suggest that pregnant women experience everyday life problems with memory that are not readily detected in the laboratory environment. The predominant use of laboratory tests may explain the myriad of previous failures to detect objective deficits in pregnant women's memory.

AB  - Aims: To perform a large and detailed epidemiologic study on restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy in a European country. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was distributed by the medical staff in different outpatient waiting rooms (obstetrics and gynecology department of the university hospital, obstetrics and gynecology department of a private clinic, private midwives, private obstetrician-gynecologists, radiological centers before fetal ultrasound examination and general practitioners) in a French town and its surrounding area (200,000 inhabitants): A woman was considered affected if she met the International RLS Study Group criteria for RLS diagnosis. Results: 1,022 pregnant women living in a French town were included. 24% of women were affected by RLS during their pregnancy. The disease was strongly related to the third trimester of pregnancy and had a significant impact on sleep leading to severe nocturnal and diurnal consequences with a high consumption of sleep medication. Conclusions: RLS affects one quarter of pregnant women, essentially during the third trimester and represents an important public health issue with sleep medication intake.

AB  - Study Objectives: Because the maternal environment can affect several physiological functions of the newborn, the aim of the present study was to examine the impact of sleep restriction during pregnancy on renal morphology and function in young offspring. Design: Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in 2 experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily. After birth, only male litters (6 for each mother) were selected and designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail plethysmography; at 3 months the renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, and number of glomeruli per mm³ were evaluated. Measurements and Results: Offspring from SR had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group (OSR), we also observed significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter, and reduced number of glomeruli per mm³ of renal tissue. Conclusions: Our data suggest that sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.

AB  - In 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics published new recommendations on infant sleep environment which advised against infants bed-sharing. A retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from 2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2–3 months, 4–5 months, and 6–8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only), breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant (P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006–2007 had a decreased rate of bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002–2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P = 0.00). In light of the high rate of bed-sharing recorded at the first well-child visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education during the third trimester of pregnancy.

TI  - Risk factors of sudden infant death syndrome and risk factors for sleep disturbances.
AU  - Kelmanson, Igor A.
T2  - Early Child Development and Care
AB  - Relationship between major risk factors of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and sleep disorders in the infants is the subject of review and discussion. Improper micro-environmental characteristics (especially poor environmental organisation and lack of developmental stimulation), pre-term delivery and/or infant low birth weight, prone sleep position, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and infant–parent(s) bed-sharing are among well-established risk factors of SIDS. These factors may also be associated with sleep disorders in infants, principally with bedtime problems, abnormal night awakenings, and arrhythmic sleep. As an attempt to fix sleep problems, some inexperienced parents may try infant-rearing practices that may only aggravate sleep troubles and lead to further increased risk of SIDS, thus giving start to a vicious circle. Health care providers need to be aware of such situations as an opportunity to provide parents with guidance with respect for individual infant and family characteristics.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate and identify determinants of health related quality of life (HRQoL) during pregnancy. Pregnant women (n = 245) completed questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey SF-36), life stress, social support, sleep, and depressed mood in the third trimester. Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems. Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Background: The etiology of excessive infant crying is largely unknown. We hypothesize that excessive infant crying may have an early nutritional origin during fetal development. Aims: This study is the first to explore whether (1) maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy are associated with excessive infant crying, and (2) whether and how maternal psychological well-being during pregnancy affects these associations. Study design: Women were approached around the 12th pregnancy week to complete a questionnaire (n=8266) and to donate a blood sample (n=4389); vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations were determined in serum. Infant crying behavior was measured through a postpartum questionnaire (±3months; n=5218). Subjects: Pregnant women living in Amsterdam and their newborn child. Outcome measures: Excessive infant crying, defined as crying ≥3h/day on average in the past week. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for 2921 (vitamin B-12) and 2622 (folate) women. Vitamin B-12 concentration (categorized into quintiles) was associated with excessive infant crying after adjustment for maternal age, parity, ethnicity, education, maternal smoking and psychological problems (OR[95%CI]: Q1=3.31[1.48–7.41]; Q2=2.50[1.08–5.77]; Q3=2.59[1.12–6.00]; Q4=2.77[1.20–6.40]; Q5 = reference). Stratified analysis suggested a stronger association among women with high levels of psychological problems during pregnancy. Folate concentration was not associated with excessive infant crying. Conclusions: First evidence is provided for an early nutritional origin in excessive infant crying. A low maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy could, in theory, affect infant crying behavior through two potential mechanisms: the methionine–homocysteine metabolism and/or the maturation of the sleep–wake rhythm.

TI  - Gender and sleep.
AU  - Minarik, Pamela A.
T2  - Sleep disorders and sleep promotion in nursing practice.
AB  - Sex and gender differences occur during normal sleep and at sleep-wake transitions and may influence the prevalence and presentation of sleep disorders across the lifespan. These differences are influenced by neuroanatomy, hormones, and chronobiological and psychosocial factors. Fluctuations in reproductive hormones influence women's sleep during puberty, across menstrual cycles, and throughout pregnancy and menopause (Paul, Turek, & Kryger, 2008). Levels of testosterone change more slowly over the male lifespan, but they also have an influence on sleep. Although understudied, stress, social roles, and other psychosocial issues also influence sleep and may partially explain some of the observed gender differences; and gender differences in sleep or underlying sleep mechanisms may contribute to disorders such as depression that are more prevalent in women. Understanding gender-related differences in sleep and factors that contribute to these differences and their consequences is necessary to guide gender-specific care related to sleep promotion and prevention and management of sleep disorders. The purpose of this chapter is to describe sex and gender differences in normal sleep throughout the lifespan and hormonal changes that affect sleep in women and men that may underlie risk for the development of sleep disorders. In this chapter, gender refers to gender identity within the context of relationships to the society and culture that may evolve over time. The term "sex" is defined by genetic sex, gonadal sex, and phenotypic sex (Paul et al., 2008). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Lee, Kathryn A.
T2  - Sleep disorders and sleep promotion in nursing practice.
AB  - During the childbearing phase of life, a woman's sleep can be profoundly altered, with increased risk for physical and mental health problems. Poor sleep can adversely affect labor and delivery, lead to poor maternal-infant interactions or poor relationships with other adults, and even affect the infant's growth and development. Hormonal alterations during early pregnancy, enlargement of the fetus during late pregnancy, and a newborn with random patterns of sleeping and feeding contribute to her disrupted sleep. This chapter briefly reviews normal physiological and anatomical changes that occur during pregnancy and discusses common sleep disorders that can occur during pregnancy as well as postpartum. The adverse effects of poor sleep on labor and delivery outcomes are briefly discussed, and postpartum sleep patterns are reviewed within the context of risk for postpartum depression. Throughout this chapter, the nurses' role in sleep promotion is discussed in relation to sleep hygiene behaviors that can be adapted for pregnant women and new mothers and their families during the first 6 months postpartum. The chapter describes alternative strategies nurses can use to safely promote sleep during the perinatal period. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are discussed as they are two of the most critical causes of disturbed sleep during pregnancy and require urgent assessment and referral for effective and non-pharmacologic interventions. The final section of this chapter describes sleep during the postpartum period, when women's experience with sleep deprivation is expected. Strategies to promote sleep and reduce the risk of excessive daytime sleepiness are discussed. Chronic sleep loss may be a risk factor for postpartum depression. Given the increased risk of postpartum depression, all pregnant and postpartum women should be screened for depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - BMJ: British Medical Journal
AB  - Objectives: To determine whether reduced sleep is associated with differences in body composition and the risk of becoming overweight in young children. Design: Longitudinal study with repeated annual measurements. Setting: Dunedin, New Zealand. Participants: 244 children recruited from a birth cohort and followed from age 3 to 7. Main outcome measures: Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (kg), and fat free mass (kg) measured with bioelectrical impedance; dual energy x ray absorptiometry; physical activity and sleep duration measured with accelerometry; dietary intake (fruit and vegetables, non-core foods), television viewing, and family factors (maternal BMI and education, birth weight, smoking during pregnancy) measured with questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for multiple confounders, each additional hour of sleep at ages 3-5 was associated with a reduction in BMI of 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.96) and a reduced risk of being overweight (BMI ≥85th centile) of 0.39 (0.24 to 0.63) at age 7. Further adjustment for BMI at age 3 strengthened these relations. These differences in BMI were explained by differences in fat mass index (−0.43, −0.82 to −0.03) more than by differences in fat free mass index (−0.21, −0.41 to −0.00). Conclusions: Young children who do not get enough sleep are at increased risk of becoming overweight, even after adjustment for initial weight status and multiple confounding factors. This weight gain is a result of increased fat deposition in both sexes rather than additional accumulation of fat free mass. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Sleep and development: Familial and socio-cultural considerations.
AB  - Sleep problems across development are common, from infancy through adolescence (Meltzer & Mindell, 2006a). Further, the consequences of disrupted or insufficient sleep are numerous, impacting growth, learning, development, and mood (Fallone, Owens, & Deane, 2002). However, youth do not live in isolation, but rather are a part of a family system that is dynamic and interactive. One consequence of sleep problems in youth that has only recently received increasing attention is how sleep disorders or sleep disruptions in youth affect parent sleep and daytime functioning. The purpose of this chapter is to review the existing literature in this area. We will begin with a review of the relationship between sleep in children and their parents using a developmental framework from pregnancy through adolescence. This will be followed by a review of the complex relationship among a child's illness or developmental disorder, the child's sleep, and both parental sleep and daytime functioning. Throughout we will highlight how the treatment of sleep problems in children is essential, resulting in the improvement of not only the child's sleep but also parent sleep and daytime functioning.

AB  - Postpartum sleep disruption is common among new parents. In this randomized controlled trial we evaluated a modified sleep hygiene intervention for new parents (infant proximity, noise masking, and dim lighting) in anticipation of night-time infant care. Two samples of new mothers (n = 118 and 122) were randomized to the experimental intervention or attention control, and sleep was assessed in late pregnancy and first 3 months postpartum using actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. The sleep hygiene strategies evaluated did not benefit the more socioeconomically advantaged women or their partners in Sample 1, but did improve postpartum sleep among the less advantaged women of Sample 2. Simple changes to the bedroom environment can improve sleep for new mothers with few resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Bipolar Disorders
AB  - Objectives: Psychotic disorders have a high rate of relapse in the postpartum period for reasons that are unclear, but may be related to changes in sleep patterns that occur during pregnancy and after birth. Understanding of the influence of sleep on postpartum psychosis presentation is limited. The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in sleep/wake activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women with a history of psychosis. Methods: Women with a history of bipolar disorder and/or postpartum psychosis (HxW) were recruited (n = 23) together with a control population (CtW) (n = 15). Data on demographic and psychosocial factors, mental health status, and sleep/wake activity were collected at seven timepoints—the last week of each trimester of pregnancy and four times during the postpartum (weeks 1, 4, and 8, and at month 6). Longitudinal data were analysed using an HLM version 6 repeated-measures multilevel model. Results: No significant differences were noted in sleep/wake activity between HxW and CtW. None of the HxW who were taking a mood stabilizer during their pregnancy, including at delivery, relapsed during the study. Of those taking an antidepressant or antipsychotic, or no medication, 3 relapsed within the first six months and 2 within the first two months. HxW were more likely to report a poor partner relationship than CtW. Conclusion: Results suggest that during the perinatal period, there is no difference in sleep/wake activity in women with a history of a psychotic disorder. Use of mood stabilizer during pregnancy and at delivery appears important in preventing psychotic relapse in the postpartum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

Their article is effective in pointing out that in our office waiting rooms and clinics, 64% of magazine pictures that show sleeping infants who are not being held by an adult are in the prone position. In addition, many more of our waiting-room magazine pictures show infants sleeping together with another person. We should applaud the authors for their important work, but we should also berate ourselves for accepting the status quo and distributing the offending magazine literature for people to read. We have an obligation to remove the harmful magazines that illustrate unsafe sleep environments from our premises and then write to the publisher, explaining the potential harm of providing literature in their publications that is contrary to accepted safety recommendations. Their article recognizes a health problem, but the rest should be up to us, starting with removing the offending magazines from our offices and then explaining to our patients' families why we did so.

A gentle giant, he was equal parts compassion, passion, and intelligence. Ed was an active academician, authoring and co-authoring many, but more importantly, ever thoughtful papers and chapters. His areas of interest in epilepsy included new drug development (felbamate, fosphenytoin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam), neuroimaging (SPECT, PET), psychiatric issues, and epilepsy surgery. Among his other areas of expertise were the diagnosis and treatment of nonepileptic seizures, brain tumors, and epilepsy; sleep and epilepsy; quality of life of people with epilepsy; refractory status epilepticus; omega fatty acids for epilepsy; and effects of maternal drug treatment on pregnancy and fetal outcomes.

TI  - Measures of verbal, everyday, and subjective memory during pregnancy.
AU  - Calde, Karin
AB  - In this study the performance of 75 pregnant women and 25 non-pregnant women was tested using measures of verbal, everyday, and subjective memory. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVEL), the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, Extended Version (RBMT-E), and the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ) were used to determine if differences in memory performance could be detected between the two groups and if there was a specific trimester of pregnancy when memory declined most significantly. The relationships among the tests also were examined. The pregnant group reported significantly more memory problems than the non-pregnant group on the EMQ, which was explained by reported sleep loss; the pregnant group reported significantly more sleep problems than the non-pregnant comparison group. The hypotheses that the pregnant group would perform significantly worse than the non-pregnant group on the RAVLT and RBMT-E tests were not supported by the results. While the objective memory measures showed a moderate relationship with one another, the EMQ showed an insignificant relationship with the IRMBT-E and RAVLT. It is speculated that the discrepancy between the subjective and objective memory test results is due to the pregnant group's ability to overcome mild memory deficits for short periods of time. Popular culture may also play a role in fostering the belief that memory loss occurs during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - St. Louis, Erik K.
T2  - Current Neuropharmacology
AB  - Despite advances in epilepsy therapeutics, some physicians feel uncomfortable with newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) due to difficulty in promptly obtaining blood levels to guide medication adjustment, and even when levels for newer AEDs are obtained, many practitioners feel they are not very useful. Lacking confidence in AEDs whose levels that cannot readily or expeditiously be measured, many clinicians share uncertainty about proper use of the newer AEDs and monitoring AED administration. Similarly, some epilepsy patients inflate the importance of AED blood level monitoring, feeling that blood levels falling within traditionally therapeutic ranges are a fail-safe for seizure control, regardless of their compliance or personal behavior aggravating seizure burden, such as poor sleep or use of illicit substances. This review examines the elusive concept of therapeutic AED blood levels and potential uses and abuses of blood level monitoring, reinforcing appropriate uses for blood levels to ensure compliance and adjust for altered AED pharmacokinetics in the context of aging and disease states, pregnancy, or drug interactions.

AB  - The United States is in the midst of an obesity crisis. The majority of American women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. The presence of excess body weight in a woman can negatively impact fertility, pregnancy, postnatal recovery, and the health of her child. Psychiatric comorbidities, including eating and mood disorders, can influence nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy and weight loss in the postpartum period. Stress associated with care taking in the postpartum period impacts levels of sleep and physical activity, which further impact postpartum weight retention. This article reviews the literature in these areas; the article discusses the management of excess body weight during and after pregnancy as well as related psychiatric conditions in pregnant and postpartum women.

AB  - Activity-rest behaviour of 11 neonates whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy (s-group) and 11 neonates of non-smoking mothers (ns-group) born by Caesarean section (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using Actiwatch® actometers. In addition, a standardised diary was kept regularly. Amount of sleep time during daytime, night time, and 24 h, as well as sleep bouts during daytime and night time, were compared. Both groups showed a significant difference in amount of night time sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at night time. Many adverse effects of smoking during pregnancy are known. We could not, however, detect significant differences in the amount of night time sleep, daytime sleep, and 24h sleep time between the s- and ns-group neonates.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between maternal prenatal attachment and postnatal infant sleep. Ninety first-time pregnant mothers, between 35 and 40 gestational weeks, completed the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (Müller, 1989), which consists of 21 items and assesses the mother's prenatal attachment to her fetus. After the birth of their infant, the mothers charted their infant's sleep for three consecutive 24-hour periods when the infant was 1 week and 3 months old, using the Sleep/Activity Record (Barnard, 1999). Correlational analysis revealed that PAI scores did not correlate with either infant sleep segments or longest sustained sleep. However, the study found an inverted correlation between PAI scores and infant total sleep at one week. The study extends current literature on prenatal to postnatal continuity.

AB  - This study is a review over the results of the researches made on the effects of the new electronic technologies on children. The behavioral problems developed by the children whose mothers were using regularly mobile phones during their pregnancy were: 25% more risk from emotional problems; 35% more risk from difficult relationships with peers and chances to become hyperactive; 50% more proneness to problems with conduct. The children who use frequently the mobile phones develop problems as headache, fatigue, difficulties in concentration, vertigo/dizziness, attention disorders, nervousness, changes in the sleep architecture etc. Not just the use of new gadgets create problems, but also social networking websites as Facebook, Twitter etc. are said to shorten attention span, encourage instant gratification and make young people more self-centered. Starting from these researches from around the world, it is very necessary that also Balkan countries to make studies on the impact of new communication technologies.

AB  - Objective: By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present. The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity. Methods: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic mother–child pairs were studied in a prospective study. Mother’s reported child’s race/ethnicity. The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4 years old that are known to be associated with child obesity. Results: In multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01 for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4 months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic); and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black, 7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black, 3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy. Conclusions: Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for obesity exist prenatally and in early childhood. Racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity may be determined by factors that operate at the earliest stages of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Presents the case studies of 28-year-old woman at 37 weeks’ gestation became increasingly confused and forgetful. She slept 12 hours daily, mistook her apartment for previous residences, and forgot her children’s names. She had had a febrile seizure at age 4, and several brief convulsions as a teenager. A sleep-deprived EEG had been negative. She took phenytoin for a year, then stopped prior to her first pregnancy. She had no further convulsions. She could not describe cocktail ingredients, despite working as a bartender, but correctly recited old addresses. Toes were equivocal on the right and downgoing on the left. Sensation and coordination were normal. Gait was narrow-based and slightly unsteady, but she did not fall. This 28-year-old peripartum woman has subacute onset encephalopathy with memory loss and abulia, as well as long tract signs. The widespread distribution of MRI lesions suggests a multifocal process affecting primarily the white matter. CNS vasculopathy, primary or secondary, could explain the distal caliber changes in the middle cerebral arteries. The distinctive corpus callosum lesions in this patient are like the “snowball” lesions that are characteristic of this disease, and high CSF protein is common.4,5 It is not a known complication of pregnancy.

AB  - Study Objectives: This study investigated whether there was a relationship between disrupted sleep and postpartum mood disturbances in women during the week after delivery. Design: Sleep and mood were measured during the third trimester (Time-1) and one week postpartum (Time-2) in a 2-stage longitudinal design. Setting: Participants were recruited from an antenatal clinic in a regional Melbourne hospital. Participants: Forty-four healthy women at low risk for postpartum depression. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy and subjective sleep by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; mood was assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Sleep and mood questionnaires were administered at Time-1 and Time-2. Wrist actigraphy was collected for one week at both times. After delivery, both objective and subjective nighttime sleep significantly worsened with decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, while daytime napping behavior significantly increased. On average, mood improved across all scales after delivery, although 45.95% of the sample experienced deterioration of mood. Regression analyses showed little relationship between Time-1 and Time-2 objective nighttime sleep, and postpartum mood. Variables that related to both Time-1 and Time-2 subjective perception of sleep, including subjective nighttime sleep, sleep-related daytime dysfunction, and daytime napping behavior, were significant predictors of postpartum mood. Conclusions: The perception of poor sleep, and the conscious awareness of its impact during wake-time, might share a stronger relationship with the occurrence of immediate postpartum mood disturbances than actual sleep quality and quantity.

T2  - Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry
AB  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to examine neonatal symptoms previously reported to be associated with exposure to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy in a group of infants exposed to antidepressants, using a prospective and controlled design. Method: A prospective case-control study recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27 women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about pregnancy and delivery complications. Results: There was an increased risk of discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying, jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for <3 h after a feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the special care nursery. Conclusions: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated individual differences in susceptibility to the detrimental effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Many factors, including genetic differences, have been shown to play a role in susceptibility and resistance, but few studies have investigated the range of genetic variation in rodent models. Methods: We examined ethanol teratogenesis in 5 inbred strains of mice: C57BL/6J (B6), Inbred Short-Sleep, C3H/Ibg, A/Ibg, and 129S6/SvEvTac (129). Pregnant dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose–dextrin (MD) on day 9 of pregnancy. Dams were sacrificed on day 18 and fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for gross morphological malformations. Every other fetus within a litter was then either placed in Bouin's fixative for subsequent soft-tissue analyses or eviscerated and placed in ethanol for subsequent skeletal analyses. Results: B6 mice exposed to ethanol in utero had fetal weight deficits and digit, kidney, brain ventricle, and vertebral malformations. In contrast, 129 mice showed no teratogenesis. The remaining strains showed varying degrees of teratogenesis. Conclusions: Differences among inbred strains demonstrate genetic variation in the teratogenic effects of ethanol. Identifying susceptible and resistant strains allows future studies to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying prenatal alcohol phenotypes.

TI  - New approaches in the management of insomnia: Weighing the advantages of prolonged-release melatonin and synthetic melatoninergic agonists.
AU  - Hardeland, Rüdiger
T2  - Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment
AB  - Hypnotic effects of melatonin and melatoninergic drugs are mediated via MT₁ and MT₂ receptors, especially those in the circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which acts on the hypothalamic sleep switch. Therefore, they differ fundamentally from GABAergic hypnotics. Melatoninergic agonists primarily favor sleep initiation and reset the circadian clock to phases allowing persistent sleep, as required in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A major obstacle for the use of melatonin to support sleep maintenance in primary insomnia results from its short half-life in the circulation. Solutions to this problem have been sought by developing prolonged-release formulations of the natural hormone, or melatoninergic drugs of longer half-life, such as ramelteon, tasimelteon and agomelatine. With all these drugs, improvements of sleep are statistically demonstrable, but remain limited, especially in primary chronic insomnia, so that GABAergic drugs may be indicated. Melatoninergic agonists do not cause next-day hangover and withdrawal effects, or dependence. They do not induce behavioral changes, as sometimes observed with z-drugs. Despite otherwise good tolerability, the use of melatoninergic drugs in children, adolescents, and during pregnancy has been a matter of concern, and should be avoided in autoimmune diseases and Parkinsonism. Problems and limits of melatoninergic hypnotics are compared. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality in late pregnancy and recurrence of postpartum major depression (PPMD) through 28 weeks postpartum. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 36 weeks gestation was assessed in 51 non-depressed women with a history of PPMD; recurrence was determined by the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Sleep quality in late pregnancy was not related to recurrence per se, but it was related to timing of recurrence (Kruskal-Wallace = 9.78, p = .008). Rapid recurrence (within 4 weeks post delivery) was preceded by fewer sleep complaints (mean PSQI for early recurrers = 4.8 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .09). Recurrence after 4 weeks postpartum was preceded by more sleep complaints in late pregnancy (mean PSQI for late recurrers = 9.9 vs. 7.3 for non-recurrers, p = .02). Sleep quality in late pregnancy may help in identifying women at risk for a PPMD recurrence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Circadian clocks guide the metabolic, cell-division, sleep-wake, circadian and seasonal cycles. Abnormalities in these clocks may be a health hazard. Circadian clock gene polymorphisms have been linked to sleep, mood and metabolic disorders. Our study aimed to examine polymorphisms in four key circadian clock genes in relation to seasonal variation, reproduction and well-being in a sample that was representative of the general population, aged 30 and over, living in Finland. Methodology/Principal Findings: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK and NPAS2 genes were genotyped in 511 individuals. 19 variants were analyzed in relation to 31 phenotypes that were assessed in a health interview and examination study. With respect to reproduction, women with ARNTL rs2278749 TT genotype had more miscarriages and pregnancies, while NPAS2 rs11673746 T carriers had fewer miscarriages. NPAS2 rs2305160 A allele carriers had lower Global Seasonality Scores, a sum score of six items i.e. seasonal variation of sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite and energy level. Furthermore, carriers of A allele at NPAS2 rs6725296 had greater loadings on the metabolic factor (weight and appetite) of the global seasonality score, whereas individuals with ARNTL rs6290035 TT genotype experienced less seasonal variation of energy level. Conclusions/Significance: ARNTL and NPAS2 gene variants were associated with reproduction and with seasonal variation. Earlier findings have linked ARNTL to infertility in mice, but this is the first time when any polymorphism of these genes is linked to fertility in humans.

TI  - Plasticity in the circadian system: Changing rhythms in reproducing female rodents.
AU  - Schrader, Jessica Anne
AB  - Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology are critical to ensure successful reproduction, but few studies have focused on how they may change with transitions in reproductive state. Those that have focused on pregnancy and lactation have revealed the emergence of new temporal patterns in a wide range of functions. The first part of this dissertation examines the hypothesis that these changes might be driven by modification of rhythms within the circadian system of the brain. I first characterized differences between non-pregnant and early pregnant laboratory rats in rhythms in protein expression of a neuronal activity marker (Fos) and in one component of the molecular oscillator (Per2) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which houses the primary pacemaker of the mammalian brain. In these studies I also examined the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPZ), which is involved in modulating SCN output signals. Fos rhythms in one subregion of the SCN, the shell, and in the vSPZ underwent changes in waveform, and the peak of the Per2 rhythm in the whole SCN was phase-advanced during early pregnancy. To determine whether changes in Fos expression in the SCN shell and vSPZ were light-dependent, I next characterized differences in light-induced Fos expression in the SCN and vSPZ in non-pregnant and early pregnant rats housed in constant darkness. The rhythms of light-responsivity of the SCN shell and vSPZ were altered in early pregnancy, but in a manner that indicates that changes in these areas in animals kept in a light/dark cycle were not light-dependent. I next present evidence that rhythms in Per2 expression in some, but not all, extra-SCN oscillators within the brain also change in early pregnancy. This indicates that some aspect of early pregnancy induces modifications in the coupling of different elements of the circadian system. This could potentially cause rhythms in varying aspects of physiology and behavior to change in different ways. I also show that temporal patterns of Fos expression in some, but not all, non-circadian regulatory systems within the brain are modified in early pregnancy. Therefore, it appears that integration of concurrent changes in rhythms within and beyond the circadian system leads to a re-organization of rhythmicity within the brain. This might be part of the mechanism by which transitions from one reproductive state to another lead to the emergence of a diverse range of new rhythmic patterns in behavior and physiology. In my final experiment, I characterized rhythms in activity and temperature in females of a diurnal rodent species, the Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus), as they progressed through a series of reproductive states. In contrast to nocturnal rodents, rhythms in females of this species underwent changes in amplitude, but not in phase, during pregnancy and lactation. This suggests that diurnal and nocturnal species may need to modulate their rhythms in different ways in order to reproduce successfully. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Case: Sonia's mother was concerned about her 9-year old daughter's aggression, defiant behavior, and distractibility. When she was 4-years, she kicked her bother and he lost a tooth as a result of the trauma. At this time, her pediatrician was concerned about hyperactivity, impulsivity, and defiance of authority and recommended a psychological evaluation. Sonia's father refused an evaluation and responded by physically abusing his wife while demanding a transfer to a new physician. Sonia's mother left her husband at this time and moved away with Sonia. Spousal abuse occurred frequently before the separation, and Sonia may have been physically abused as well. Currently, Sonia is in third grade where she is underperforming in many areas. She enjoys drawing and reading, but struggles to sit quietly and stay on task. Her teacher reports frequent vocal and physical disruptions. Homework takes an inordinate amount of time to complete. She does not have a sustained friendship; her mother feels that this is because other kids do not like being bossed by Sonia. Her mother is concerned about Sonia's behavior especially the unremorseful disruptive behavior toward her younger brother and grandmother. Sonia was born after an uneventful full-term pregnancy without evidence of maternal smoking, drugs, alcohol, or medications. Motor and social developmental milestones were achieved at the appropriate time. Language milestones were achieved early; her mother recalls that Sonia learned to read at the age of 3 years. Sonia's medical history is significant for obesity, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and delayed sleep onset with prolonged awakenings associated with nightmares. Her mother reports that Sonia worries about everything, including thoughts that her brother will turn into a monster. When an argument occurs at home, she gets scared, bites her nails, and cries. Sonia currently lives with her mother, 2 younger brothers, step-father, and grandparents. Family history is significant for drug abuse by her father and mental illness in the father's family. While conducting an interview with her mother, Sonia was asked to draw a picture of her family. Instead, she illustrated a book detailing her past experience in words accompanying each drawing. She described how she watched her father physically abuse her mother and her persistent fear of danger when conflict occurred at home. Although spelling was poor, her vocabulary, sequencing, and illustrations demonstrated above age-level skills for written expression and drawing. Examples of the writing that accompanied the drawings include: I hate when my parents fight. I get scared and feel sick to my tummy like I want to throw up. I just hate that feeling! My mom told me she had a 'boyfriend.' These words were the most horrible I ever heard. Soon a nightmare began. Nightmares make me very, very scared.

AB  - Purpose: This study explored (a) differences in sleep quality, depression, and stress among second- and third-trimester pregnant and nonpregnant women, and (b) relationships among depression, stress, and sleep quality of pregnant women in Taiwan. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: A convenience sample of 150 second-trimester and 150 third-trimester pregnant women was recruited from two medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Findings: The prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score>5) was 60.0 for second- and third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0 for nonpregnant women. After controlling for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3 to 36.0 ) was found in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not in nonpregnant women. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was related to stress and depression. Clinical Relevance: Evaluation for sleep quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder.

TI  - Accurate assessment of mother & infant sleep: How many diary days are required?
AU  - Thomas, Karen A.
AU  - Burr, Robert L.
T2  - MCN: The American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern. Study Design and Methods: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data. Results: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r ≥ 0.80) when 3 days of data were used. Clinical Implications: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

TI  - Breastfeeding behavior and related factors in low-income and ethnically diverse mother-infant dyads.
AU  - Doan, Therese Hong-Dung
AB  - Breastfeeding (BF) is a health-promoting behavior and exclusive BF has proven economic and ecologic benefits to individuals and societies. Yet Healthy People 2010 BF objectives for exclusive BF remain unmet and prevalence is lowest for low-income populations. The purpose of this descriptive longitudinal study of 126 predominantly low income and ethnically diverse mother-infant dyads was to compare maternal and infant factors associated with nighttime BF behavior between exclusive BF dyads and supplemented dyads. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, independent t-tests, and Chi-square tests were used for analysis. BF behavior was categorized as either (1)  exclusive BF, defined as 100% BF or breastmilk feeding on all three nights, or (2) supplementation, defined as any formula during any of the three nights. Compared to women in supplementation (n=59), women in exclusive BF (n=67) were older, more likely Caucasian, working at 36 weeks pregnant but not working at 1 month postpartum, in a relationship, and getting less help with baby at night. There was no group difference in objective sleep at the last month of pregnancy assessment. At one month postpartum, women in the supplementation group averaged 30 minutes less night sleep compared to women in the exclusive BF group. Compared to infants who were supplemented (n=54), infants who were exclusively breastfed (n=66) were significantly more likely to room-in with mothers in hospital and receive a home visit. They were statistically larger at birth, although the difference in size may not be clinically relevant. Assessment of sleep in new mothers is important for BF maintenance and more effort is needed to promote exclusive BF among younger women, African Americans and women of Asian descent. Rooming-in practice in the hospital after birth should be encouraged, as it was significantly associated with exclusive BF behavior at one month postpartum in this diverse sample of new families. Future research using a qualitative approach would be ideal to discover how nighttime feeding for new mothers evolves over time, their motivation for BF, and their network of influence in support of BF behavior. Findings from qualitative research will be useful in developing an effective intervention for BF maintenance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Sleep Medicine Reviews
AB  - Sleep duration in the population has been declining. Women occupy an increasingly prominent place in the work force without reducing most of their responsibilities at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women’s daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes. We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

AB  - Our aim was to examine the characteristics of EEG findings and epilepsy in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and the associated clinical and familial risk factors. Fifty-seven children (86% male) with ASD, mean age 82 ± 36.2 months, were included in the study. Thirty-nine (68.4%) children had the diagnosis of autism, 15 (26.3%) had Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and 3 (5.3%) had high-functioning autism. One hour of sleep and/or awake EEG recordings was obtained for each child. All patients were evaluated with respect to clinical and familial characteristics and with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The frequency of interictal epileptiform EEG abnormalities (IIEAs) was 24.6% (n = 14), and the frequency of epilepsy was 14.2% (n = 8). IIEAs were associated with a diagnosis of epilepsy (P = 0.0001), Childhood Autism Rating Scale Activity scores (P = 0.047), and a history of asthma and allergy (P = 0.044). Epilepsy was associated with a family history of epilepsy (P = 0.049) and psychiatric problems in the mother during pregnancy (P = 0.0026). Future studies with larger samples will help to clarify the possible associations of epilepsy/IIEAs with asthma/allergy, hyperactivity, and familial factors in ASD.

T2  - Psikiyatride Güncel Yaklaşımlar
AB  - During the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and breast-feeding periods, as well as in menopausal and post-menopausal periods, the physiological and psychological processes that change according to the hormonal fluctuations influence every women similarly and each one differently. These physiological processes are controlled by neuroendocrine sequences, of which the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis are the most important ones. The hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis affects mood, anxiety, cognition and pain. The interaction of these hormones with mood and behavior is bidirectional. The differences in phenomenology and epidemiology of mood disorders with regards to gender can be explained with the effects of hormones. All of the periods mentioned above are related with mood disorders at terms of risk factors, disease symptoms, progress of disease and response to treatment. Epidemiologic data supports the relationship between the mood disorders and reproductive processes. The prevalence of major depression increases in women with the menarche and ceases in post- menopausal period. Similarly, the initial symptoms of bipolar disorder begins around the menarche period in 50% of the cases. Despite proper treatment, some female patients with major depression experience recurrence during the premenstrual period of their menstrual cycles. The conformity and change in a woman’s brain during pregnancy is controlled dominantly by the neuroendocrine systems, while it is controlled by the external stimuli actively related to the baby during nursing period. The changes that occur are closely related to postpartum mood disorders. Again, all the changes and suspension of medication during this procedure are risk factors for early depressive and dysphoric situations. Variables of a wide range, from follicle stimulating hormone, melatonin, and sleep to body mass index interact with mood disorders in menopausal and post-menopausal periods. Interest on the effects of gonadal steroids on the central nervous system has grown parallel with our increasing knowledge. In the last decade, the place of hormonal treatments in the treatment of mood disorders have been discussed continuously. During this period, along with the anti-depressant efficacy of estrogen, anti-manic efficacy of tamoxifen was also demonstrated in several studies. In this paper, the complex relationship between the physiological changes and the mood disorders during a menstrual cycle, pregnancy, nursing, menopausal and post-menopausal periods are briefly reviewed and discussed over the reproductive hormones in the context of etiology, phenomenology and treatment.

T2  - Women's Health Issues
AB  - Background and Purpose: Sleep quality seems to be an antecedent to depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We sought to 1) examine the psychometrics of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in pregnancy; 2) examine whether sleep quality predicted increases in depressive symptoms; and 3) compare PSQI scores across 3 or 2 levels of depressive symptoms. Methods: Each of the 252 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (short form) and a sleep quality measure at mid and late pregnancy. Results: PSQI total scores showed good internal consistency and construct validity. An improved model of the internal structure of the PSQI in pregnancy was found with 1 factor labeled Sleep Efficiency, a second labeled Night and Daytime Disturbances, and an Overall Sleep Quality component associated with, but separate from, both of these 2 factors. Although PSQI scores showed moderate stability over time, sleep disturbance scores increased in late pregnancy. Importantly, PSQI prospectively predicted increases in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the PSQI is useful in pregnancy research. Findings also support the idea that sleep problems are prospective risk factors for increases in depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Practitioners are advised to screen for sleep quality during early pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - A multistage chronobiologic intervention for the treatment of depression: A pilot study.
AU  - Moscovici, Lucian

T2  - Journal of Affective Disorders
AB  - Background: Most antidepressant medications in current use have several disadvantages: a delayed therapeutic effect, side effects, stigmatization and concerns about safety for the developing fetus during pregnancy. Several chronobiologic techniques which are free of these disadvantages were proposed as an alternative. The current article reports the design and the initial outcome results of a new chronobiologic multistage intervention (CMI) that is comprised of the following techniques: (i) partial sleep deprivation during the second half of the night (wake therapy—WT), (ii) medium (green) wavelength light in combination with dawn simulation (DS), (iii) bright light therapy (BLT), and (iv) sleep phase advance (SPA). Methods: The study was conducted as a set of 12 single-case designs with moderate-to-severe depressive volunteering patients. Depression, anxiety and tension measurements were taken on a daily basis beginning with a baseline measurement (T0), followed by a set of four consecutive morning measurements during the therapeutic intervention (T1–T4),and with a final measurement carried out at the end of 4 weeks of follow-up (T5). Results: A clinically significant rapid improvement of the depressive symptoms was demonstrated and maintained for at least 4 weeks after the end of the intervention. No dropouts or compliance difficulties were observed. Patient satisfaction was high, and other than having to sleep for four nights at the Research and Development Unit, participants were not inconvenienced by the nature of the therapeutic design. Sleepiness in the late afternoon hours was reported by several of the participants, but did not reach a level that interfered with their ability to function. Levels of tension did not show a consistent improvement along the intervention procedure and were not maintained in follow-up. There was some unexpected improvement in the level of anxiety that persisted at follow-up. This latter finding requires further validation by additional studies. Conclusions: These initial findings showed the procedure to be effective and well tolerated. It affords many advantages, such as the achievement of a rapid response, no extinction of the therapeutic effect after 4 weeks of follow-up, safety, high patient compliance and cost effectiveness. These encouraging results warrant validation in further randomized controlled clinical trials. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability is promising for assessing fetal condition. Before using spectral analysis for fetal monitoring it has to be determined whether there should be a correction for gestational age or behavioural state. Aims: Compare spectral values of heart rate variability between near term and post term fetuses during active and quiet sleep. Study design: Case–control. Cases had a gestational age of ≥ 42 weeks; controls were 36 to 37 weeks. Fetuses were matched for birth weight percentile. Subjects: STAN® registrations from healthy fetuses. For each fetus one 5-minute segment was selected during active and one during quiet sleep. Outcome measures; Absolute and normalized low (0.04–0.15 Hz) and high frequency power (0.4–1.5 Hz) of heart rate variability. Results: Twenty fetuses were included. No significant differences were found between cases and controls in absolute (481 and 429 respectively, P = 0.88) or normalized low (0.78 and 0.80 respectively, P = 0.50) or absolute (41 and 21 respectively, P = 0.23) or normalized high frequency power (0.08 and 0.07 respectively, P = 0.20) during active state. During rest, normalized low frequency power was lower (0.58 and 0.69 respectively, P = 0.03) and absolute (16 and 10 respectively, P = 0.04) and normalized high frequency power were higher (0.21 and 0.14 respectively, P = 0.01) in cases compared to controls. Absolute and normalized low frequency power were higher during active state compared to rest in both groups (all P values < 0.05). Conclusions: We found sympathetic predominance during active state in fetuses around term. Post term parasympathetic modulation during rest was increased compared to near term.

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - A suite of changes in circadian rhythms have been described in nocturnal rodents as females go through pregnancy and lactation, but there is no information on such patterns in diurnal species. As the challenges faced by these two groups of animals are somewhat different, we characterized changes in activity and core body temperature (Tb) in female diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) as they went through a series of reproductive states: virgin, pregnant, pregnant and lactating, lactating only, and post-weaning. The phase of neither rhythm varied, but the amplitude did. Females increased their overall levels of daily activity from early to late pregnancy, regardless of whether they were also lactating. The pattern of activity was less rhythmic during early than mid-lactation, in both non-pregnant and pregnant females, as a consequence of a decrease in daytime relative to nighttime activity. The Tb rhythm amplitude dropped from mid-pregnancy through mid-lactation, and there were rises in Tb troughs during the mid-light and mid-dark phases of the day, though pregnancy and lactation affected Tb at these times in somewhat different ways. This study demonstrates that rhythms in diurnal grass rats change during pregnancy and lactation in different ways than those of nocturnal species that have been studied to date and that the effects of pregnancy and lactation are not additive in any simple way.

This study linked the 2001 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Data set with Taiwan’s birth and death certificate registries. In total, 220 465 singleton live births were included. The key dependent variable was whether or not an infant’s father was diagnosed with schizophrenia, while the independent variable of interest was whether an infant had LBW. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between paternal schizophrenia and the risk of LBW, after adjusting for the infant and parents’ characteristics. The results show that infants whose fathers had schizophrenia were more likely to have LBW than those whose fathers did not (12.6% vs 8.0%). Infants whose fathers had schizophrenia were found to be 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.10–2.52, P < .05) times more likely to have LBW than their counterparts whose fathers did not have schizophrenia, following adjustment for gestational week at birth, parity, paternal age and highest educational level, family monthly incomes, and marital status. We conclude that the offspring whose fathers had a diagnosis of schizophrenia had increased risk of LBW compared with those whose fathers had no schizophrenia. This finding paves the way for further studies and suggests that there may be potential benefit to early intervention to prevent LBW in pregnant women with husbands with schizophrenia.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to smoking and alcohol increases the risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Physiological changes associated with these exposures are not well studied. Full-term infants were tested within the first 3 days of life. We hypothesized that maternal alcohol consumption and/or smoking during pregnancy would alter autonomic nervous system function. Newborns whose mothers smoked during pregnancy had lower beat-to-beat heart rate variability in quiet sleep. Infants whose mothers consumed alcohol had lower global heart rate variability, but only in active sleep. Unexposed infants demonstrated increases in heart rate with head-up tilt and decreases in heart rate with head-down tilt, but smoking and alcohol-exposed infants showed no significant responses. These results indicate that autonomic function is altered by prenatal exposure to alcohol and smoking. Such markers may provide early identification of infants at greatest risk for SIDS.

AB  - Little is known about factors associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Of 60 435 pregnant women in a population-based cohort, 3480 (5.8%) reported having migraine during the first 5 months of pregnancy. Of these, 2525 (72.6%) reported using migraine pharmacotherapy, mostly non-narcotic analgesics (54.1%) and triptans (25.4%). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.

T2  - Child Development
AB  - Infant sleep is a major source of concern for many parents. The aims of this longitudinal study were to assess: (a) the development of sleep patterns among infants, (b) the development of maternal cognitions regarding infant sleep, and (c) the relations between these domains during the 1st year of life. Eighty-five mothers were recruited during pregnancy and completed a questionnaire aimed at assessing maternal sleep-related cognitions. After delivery (at 1, 6, and 12 months) sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep logs, and maternal cognitions were reassessed. The findings demonstrated significant predictive and concomitant links between maternal cognitions and infant sleep. Maternal soothing behaviors mediated the relations between these domains.

T2  - Revue Neurologique
AB  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sensorimotor disorder where patients complain of an almost irresistible urge to move their legs. This urge can often be accompanied by pain or other unpleasant sensations, it either occurs or worsens with rest particularly at night, and improves with activity. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group has established four essential criteria for clinical diagnosis of RLS. State of art: Affecting an estimated 7.2 to 11.5% of the adult population, the symptoms of RLS may be associated with significant sleep disturbance and may have a negative impact on quality of life. The prevalence of RLS increases with age, and women are more frequently affected than men. In France, the estimated prevalence is 8.5%. Among sufferers, 4.4% complain of very severe symptoms. Although RLS is mainly idiopathic, several clinical conditions have been associated with it, especially iron deficiency with or without anemia, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. These conditions may share a common pathophysiological mechanism involving a disorder of iron metabolism. By contrast, controversy persists as to whether polyneuropathy, particularly when associated with diabetes, is to be considered as an important cause of secondary RLS. This association is difficult to demonstrate as conventional electromyography is not adequate to detect small fiber neuropathy often associated with diabetes. Conclusion and perspectives: RLS is often underdiagnosed and few subjects receive recommended RLS drug treatment. There is a clear need for complementary education to improve the accurate diagnosis of RLS. Indeed, better knowledge of this syndrome is a prerequisite to prompt an appropriate therapeutic management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Study Objectives: We examined whether small body size at birth and prenatal tobacco or alcohol exposure predict poor sleep and more sleep disturbances in children. Design: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term. Measurements and results: Sleep duration and efficiency were measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and low sleep efficiency (≤ 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7), respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8 years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Poor sleep in children may have prenatal origins. Possible mechanisms include alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other conditions associated with small body size at birth.

TI  - Sleep-related disturbances during pregnancy and their effects on postpartum mood disorders.
AU  - Flesher, William R.
AB  - Epidemiological research examining the consequences of sleep-related disturbances (SRDs) during and after pregnancy on mood disorders in women is lacking. The theoretical framework for this study is based on the biopsychosocial model, which proposes that sleep functions as a moodregulating system and addresses certain perinatal biological, psychological and social pressures. Therefore, the hypothetical basis for this research is based on the assumption that perinatal women experiencing SRDs are at greater risk of developing postpartum mood disorders than those women who are not subjected to SRDs perinatally. This prospective cohort study of perinatal women ( N = 38) examined the number and the effects of perinatal SRDs on perinatal mood disorders. Measurements of SRDs in this group included the PSQI and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. While the CES-D scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Zung Anxiety scale evaluated mood disorders. Using binomial approximations, relative risk, and multiple regression analyses the results of this study found that perinatal women experience more SRDs than non-pregnant women, perinatal SRDs increase the risk of perinatal mood disorders, and perinatal SRDs are predictive of mood disorders during and after pregnancy. In conclusion, these results establish that women experiencing perinatal SRDs have an increased risk of developing mood disorders during and after pregnancy. Therefore, the need for effective techniques in the prevention and intercession of SRDs in women during and after pregnancy will aid in the reduction of perinatal mood disorders. Recommendations to maternal healthcare providers would include the extensive use of sleep histories taken throughout the perinatal period for the early detection of SRDs. This information will facilitate maternal healthcare providers allowing for adequate treatment of SRDs and alleviate one of the triggering mechanisms of perinatal mood disorders leading to a positive psychosocial change in perinatal women.

AB  - The prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is low in the general population in Turkey. To assess the prevalence of RLS in pregnancy, a hospital-based survey assessing symptoms of RLS and other sleep problems was performed through face-to-face interviews and physical examination on 983 pregnant women from 11 hospitals in the two urban and four suburban areas of Kayseri, Turkey, at the time of delivery and 6 months after delivery. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International RLS Study Group. A total of 103 women reported the occurrence of RLS symptoms during pregnancy, giving an RLS prevalence rate of 10.48%, with presence of symptoms more than three times per month, which decreased to 2.9% after 6 months. A significant relationship was observed between RLS and the number of previous pregnancies: women who had one child were compared with women who had 2–3 children (odds ratio [OR] = 1.441, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.894–2.324), and women who had ≥4 children (OR = 2.530, 95% CI, 1.377–4.650). Patients with and without the RLS syndrome were similar in respect to distributions of age, income level, career, iron and folate therapy, sleep habits, and sleep problems. The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women is low, like the low prevalence in the general population in Eastern European and/or Asian populations.

T2  - Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research
AB  - Objectives: To examine biobehavioral responses to an acute pain event in a Cape Town, South Africa, cohort consisting of 28 Cape Colored (mixed ancestry) newborns (n = 14) heavily exposed to alcohol during pregnancy (exposed), and born to abstainers (n = 14) or light (≤0.5 oz absolute alcohol/d) drinkers (controls). Methods: Mothers were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Newborn data were collected on postpartum day 3 in the maternity obstetrical unit where the infant had been delivered. Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was defined as maternal consumption of at least 14 drinks/wk or at least 1 incident of binge drinking/mo. Acute stress-related biobehavioral markers [salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), spectral measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and videotaped facial actions] were collected thrice during a heel lance blood collection (baseline, lance, and recovery). After a feeding and nap, newborns were administered an abbreviated Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. Results: There were no between-group differences in maternal age, marital status, parity, gravidity, depression, anxiety, pregnancy smoking, maternal education, or infant gestational age at birth (all ps > 0.15). In both groups, HR increased with the heel lance and decreased during the postlance period. The alcohol-exposed group had lower mean HR than controls throughout, and showed no change in RSA over time. Cortisol levels showed no change over time in controls but decreased over time in exposed infants. Although facial action analyses revealed no group differences in response to the heel lance, behavioral responses assessed on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale showed less arousal in the exposed group. Conclusions: Both cardiac autonomic and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal stress reactivity measures suggest a blunted response to an acute noxious event in alcohol-exposed newborns. This is supported by results on the Brazelton Neonatal Scale indicating reduced behavioral arousal in the exposed group. To our knowledge, these data provide the first biobehavioral examination of early pain reactivity in alcohol-exposed newborns and have important implications for understanding neuro-/biobehavioral effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in the newborn period.

AB  - The effects of comorbid depression and anxiety were compared to the effects of depression alone and anxiety alone on pregnancy mood states and biochemistry and on neonatal outcomes in a large multi-ethnic sample. At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone.

AB  - Objective: To explore women’s levels of childbirth fear, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and fatigue and their relationships during the third trimester of pregnancy. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of a community sample. Participants: Six hundred and fifty English-speaking nulliparous and multiparous women, 17 to 46 years of age and between 35 and 39 weeks gestation, with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell’s Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire. Results: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and 20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians. Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted higher levels of childbirth fear among women. Conclusion: One fourth of women reported high childbirth fear. Women’s fear of childbirth was related to fatigue, available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of a complex picture of women’s emotional experiences during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Study Objective: To determine whether preconceptional psychological distress is associated with infant sleep disturbance. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Southampton, UK. Participants: A cohort of women from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), who were recruited between 20-34 years of age and followed through their subsequent pregnancies and beyond; a total of 874 mother-infant pairs were involved in the study. Measurements and Results: Preconceptional psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). When their infants were 6 and 12 months of age, mothers were asked to report the number of times babies woke on average between the hours of midnight and 06:00 each night during a 2-week period. Preconceptional psychological distress was a strong predictor of infant night waking at both 6 and 12 months of age, independent of the effects of postnatal depression, bedroom sharing, and other confounding factors. At 6 months, preconceptional distress was associated with a 23% increased risk of waking (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.23,95% C11.06-1.44), and at 12 months with a 22% increased risk (PR 1.22, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.02-1.46). Conclusions: Women with preconceptional psychological distress are more likely to have babies with sleep disturbance during infancy, independent of whether they suffered from postnatal depression.

AU  - Leonhard, Catherine

T2  - Chronobiology International
AB  - Different factors have been proposed to influence morningness-eveningness, biological rhythms, and sleep-wake cycles, but few studies focused on the influence of social habits. Here, we focus on the influence of children and partners on the social habits of women at different stages of their lives and on synchronization within the family. One hundred and seventy-nine women participated in the study and were allocated into four groups: women without children, pregnant women without children, pregnant women with children, and non-pregnant mothers. Morningness was predicted by the presence of children, and earlier chronotype was predicted by the presence of children, pregnancy, and age. Average sleep duration was longest in pregnant women. The presence of children was responsible for a difference in rise times of approximately 1.5 h on the weekend. Subjective sleep-onset latencies were shortest in women with children. The synchrony between partners (husband/wife) was 0.46 in women without children, 0.79 in pregnant women, 0.40 in women with children, and 0.56 between mother and child. Partners’ chronotypes were highly correlated, as were those of mother and child. This study suggests children have a strong influence on their mother’s lifestyle and sleep-wake rhythm, far beyond the first-months of life, and that children are a more important social factor than the male partner.

AB  - Background: The decrease of maternal docosahexaenoic (DHA) status during pregnancy has been associated with postpartum depression, especially in women with a low intake of DHA. Since the DHA intake in the Netherlands is low, we investigated whether supplementation of low doses of DHA or DHA plus arachidonic acid (AA) during pregnancy and lactation could prevent depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances in this period. Methods: Women were supplemented daily with placebo, DHA (220 mg) or DHA+AA (220 mg each) from week 16 of pregnancy till three months postpartum. Fatty acid analyses were performed in the available plasma samples at 16 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Depressive symptoms were measured in weeks 16 and 36 of pregnancy and six weeks postpartum using EPDS and within one week postpartum using a blues questionnaire. Results: 119 women completed the study. The average frequency of fish intake was low, 0.94 times per week, and did not differ between the groups. The supplementation groups did not differ in mean EPDS scores or changes in EPDS scores, nor in incidence or severity of postpartum blues. Red blood cell DHA, AA and DHA/ AA ratio did not correlate with EPDS or blues scores. Indices of sleep quality did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: Supplementation of 220 mg/day DHA or DHA+AA (220 mg/day each) does not prevent peripartum depressive symptoms, in a population based sample with low background DHA intake.

T2  - Psycho-oncology, 2nd ed.
AB  - There is common understanding among clinicians treating cancer patients in the developing world that the suffering of the body as a result of growing tumors leads to the suffering of the mind. In spite of this, it is appalling that few clinicians in these countries translate this understanding into action in their practice. In most cases the psychological issues receive very little attention and most patients make their psychological cancer journeys alone. The diagnosis of cancer to patients in developing countries is in most instances equated to death. This evokes intense emotional crisis and loss of hope. The loss of hope, a fundamental human experience manifesting as an energy which brings life and joy, influences the psychological state and behavior of patients. As patients continue on the cancer illness trajectory which is marked by increasing disability, pain and realization that cure or prolonged reprieve from death is impossible they experience multiple psychological problems. The diagnosis of cancer also brings out family issues such as—How will the children live without their father or mother? How will other dependants in the extended family live once the patient dies? A lot of questions remain unanswered and this leads to further psychological damage. Most of these problems are left unresolved in developing countries because most clinicians do not have adequate skills to deal with them. The impact of this on the quality of life of the patients and their family members is immense. This chapter highlights with case reports some psychological issues which have an impact on the quality of life of patients with common cancers in developing countries. The areas which are addressed include: Myths about cancer; Fear of Recurrence; Sexual problems; Pain perception; Fatigue; Guilty of delaying diagnosis; Guilty for doing things that may have caused cancer; Changes in physical appearance; Depression; Sleep difficulties; Changes in what they are able to do after cancer treatment; The burden the cancer may have on finances; The burden the cancer may have on the loved ones; and Concerns about whether they will be able to father children or get pregnant.

AB  - Background: Infants exposed to opioides in-utero frequently demonstrate withdrawal symptoms in the neonatal period and have difficulties with state regulation. Aim: This study examines sleep–wakefulness–distress patterns as indicators of regulatory mechanisms at 3 months of age. Participants: A national infant cohort (N = 35) born to women in high-dose maintenance treatment during pregnancy and a comparison group (N = 36) of low-risk infants born in the same period. Outcome measures: Distributions and frequencies of sleep, wakefulness and distress measured in hours and episodes on sleep charts recorded by the mothers in the two groups. Results: Women in maintenance treatment were monitored closely during pregnancy to avoid illicit drug use and to be prepared for motherhood. They were also offered residential treatment before pregnancy and after the child was born. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in any of the 10 measures reflecting diurnal and nocturnal rhythmicity at 3 months despite of neonatal abstinence syndrome in 47% of the exposed infants and significant differences in infant characteristics with respect to birth weight, gestational age and maternal characteristics. Conclusions: Follow-up procedures combining drug monitoring and counseling during pregnancy and in the first months after birth enhance the development of state regulation in terms of sleep–wakefulness patterns.

T2  - Pediatrics
AB  - Objective: The goal was to evaluate pictures in magazines widely read by women of childbearing age, for adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for safe infant sleep practices. Methods: Magazines were included in this study if they had an average female readership of >5 million, circulation of >900 000, and median age of female readers of 20 to 40 years. Twenty magazines met these criteria. An additional 8 magazines targeted toward expectant parents and parents of young children were included, for a total of 28 magazines. Pictures of infant sleep environments and sleeping infants in articles and advertisements in issues of these 28 magazines were analyzed for adherence to AAP guidelines for decreasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Results: A total of 391 unique pictures from 34 magazine issues were included in the analysis. Only 57 pictures (64%) portraying sleeping infants not being held by an adult portrayed the infants in the supine position, and 14.8% of sleeping infants were portrayed as sleeping with another person. Only 36 pictures (36.4%) of infant sleep environments portrayed a safe sleep environment, as recommended by the AAP. Conclusions: More than one third of pictures of sleeping infants in magazines geared toward childbearing women demonstrated infants in an inappropriate sleep position, and two thirds of pictures of infant sleep environments were not consistent with AAP recommendations. Messages in the media that are inconsistent with health care messages create confusion and misinformation about infant sleep safety and may lead inadvertently to unsafe practices.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to explore the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety across pregnancy and the early postpartum. Methods: Participants (N = 207) completed the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait subscale, Beck Depression Inventory, and social support and sleep quality measures at two time points during pregnancy and once in the early postpartum period. Results: After accounting for the relative stability of anxiety and depression over time, depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of anxiety in late pregnancy and anxiety in late pregnancy predicted higher depressive symptomatology in the early postpartum. A bi-directional model of depression and anxiety in pregnancy was supported. Limitations: Data were based on self-reports and participating women were predominantly tertiary educated with high family incomes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms precede the development of higher levels of anxiety and that anxiety, even at non-clinical levels, can predict higher depressive symptoms. Clinicians are advised to screen for anxiety and depression concurrently during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Children who were born prematurely are at higher risk for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) compared to their same-age peers who were born fullterm. Objective: The objective of the present study was to assess the frequency of SDB symptoms and effects on growth among preterm infants while they are still infants, with a goal of identifying risk factors to facilitate prevention and early intervention. Methods: The Louisville pediatric SDB risk survey was administered to the primary caretakers of prematurely born infants attending the Neonatal Follow-Up Clinic at West Virginia University Children’s Hospital. Results: Participation was 100% among 173 consecutive patients invited to participate in the study. At 9.13 months corrected age, 8.1% of infants born at a mean of 31.6 weeks gestation were reported to snore ≥3 days/week, a rate consistent with diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing among older children. A composite of nine parent-reported symptoms was created based on factor analysis. Birth weight and size for gestational age at birth did not differ between snoring groups or correlate with the composite score. But a significant negative correlation between the composite risk for SDB score and current weight for adjusted age percentile score indicate that infants with higher SDB symptom profiles have lower weight for age (r = -.18, p = .028). Conclusions: SDB symptoms are detectable among infants born preterm, while they are still infants. Because of their preferential risk for SDB and its somatic consequences, a primary research goal should be description of the natural history of SDB and identification of modifiable risk factors and treatment options.

AB  - Study Objectives: (1) To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for postpartum maternal sleep problems and depressive symptoms simultaneously, (2) identify factors independently associated with either condition, and (3) explore associations between specific postpartum sleep components and depression. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Population-based. Participants: All women (n = 4191) who had delivered at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2005 to September 2006 were mailed a questionnaire seven weeks postpartum. The response rate was 68% (n = 2830). Interventions: None. Measurements and results: Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The prevalence of sleep problems, defined as PSQI > 5, was 57.7%, and the prevalence of depression, defined as EPDS > 10, was 16.5%. The mean self-reported nightly sleep duration was 6.5 hours and sleep efficiency 73%. Depression, previous sleep problems, being primiparous, not exclusively breastfeeding, or having a younger or male infant were factors associated with poor postpartum sleep quality. Poor sleep was also associated with depression when adjusted for other significant risk factors for depression, such as poor partner relationship, previous depression, depression during pregnancy and stressful life events. Sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality were the aspects of sleep most strongly associated with depression. Conclusions: Poor sleep was associated with depression independently of other risk factors. Poor sleep may increase the risk of depression in some women, but as previously known risk factors were also associated, mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression are not merely reporting symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation.

TI  - Sleep disruption during pregnancy.
AU  - Sloan, Eileen P.
T2  - Sleep Medicine Clinics
AB  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with significant changes in sleep architecture and the subjective quality of sleep. These changes are caused by the many physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy (eg, altered hormone levels, increased urination at night, changes in body size) and post partum, especially with a newborn to tend. Although most women negotiate the disruption to their sleep very well, others may experience such severe disruption to sleep that it compromises their physical well-being and mental health. Physicians providing care for pregnant women must inquire about sleep patterns; if a woman is reporting significant difficulty coping with the disruption, a thorough history should be taken. Primary sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and further investigation and treatment may be warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Holt, Richard I. G.
T2  - Journal of Psychopharmacology
AB  - Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this article. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - During pregnancy several physical and hormonal alterations may affect normal sleep and the respiratory system and predispose pregnant women to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or worsen pre-existing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). SDB has been associated with several complications of pregnancy affecting maternal and fetal health. Clinicians should evaluate more closely obese pregnant women and those who develop hypertension. Early recognition and treatment of SDB may improve the outcome of pregnancy but the indications for treatment of OSAS need to be investigated. The diagnosis of OSAS in pregnancy requires a high index of suspicion and prevention of suspected SDB should be incorporated in the management of pregnancy.

AB  - The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in late pregnancy is as high as 15%, a result of normal physiologic processes occurring during pregnancy, and its prevalence in pre-eclampsia is even higher. The cardiovascular risks associated with SDB have an even stronger association in pregnancy: with SDB in pregnancy there is an eightfold relative risk of developing systemic hypertension, primarily because the vascular inflammatory processes leading to endothelial dysfunction that occur in SDB are increased during pregnancy. The fetal effects of maternal cardiovascular compromise arising from SDB include growth restriction and impaired movement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Women seem to have a heightened risk for developing sleep disorders compared with men; women also show a greater risk for developing some psychiatric problems including mood and anxiety disorders. The modulatory effects of sex hormones on sleep-wake behaviors and mood may contribute to this compounded risk and to the emergence of symptoms throughout the female reproductive life cycle. This article focuses on the clinical evidence for sleep disorders in women. Particular attention is paid to the hormonal and mood interactions with sleep disorders (sleep initiation and sleep maintenance) in the context of menstrual cycle changes, pregnancy, and in the menopausal years. Lastly, management strategies for sleep disorders in women are critically discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that disturbances in levels of plasma melatonin differentiate pregnant and postpartum women with major depression from matched pregnant and postpartum healthy comparison women. Method: Participants were 25 pregnant women (10 with major depression, 15 healthy) and 24 postpartum women (13 with major depression, 11 healthy). Healthy comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum. Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. The values of plasma melatonin levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding status, and body mass index as covariates. Results: Morning melatonin levels from 2:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women. Conclusions: Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours, were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of depression. These findings implicate disturbances in the regulation of the melatonin generating system in pregnancy and postpartum depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To identify the concordance in assessments of health and social care needs of pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness as assessed by patients themselves and their mental healthcare professionals. Thirty-five staff-patient pairs were recruited from inpatient and community services. Staff and patients completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need--Mothers Version. There were significant differences in the total number of needs (p < 0.01) and total number of unmet needs (p < 0.001) reported by staff and patients themselves. There was moderate or better agreement on the presence of an unmet need in eight of 26 life domains. Agreement was low in several domains relevant to being a mother-notably pregnancy care, safety to child/others, and practical and emotional childcare domains. Unmet needs were particularly common in the areas of daytime activities, sleep, psychological distress and violence and abuse. Staff and pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness moderately agree about health and social care needs but agree less often on which needs are unmet. This highlights the importance of the views of the mothers themselves, as well as assessments by staff. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - Pregnancy impacts common symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as energy, appetite, weight change, and sleep and somatic complaints. However, it is not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience.

Study design: We used data for 11 340 mother-infant pairs from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for infants born in Washington State, 1996 to 2002. We used predictive modeling to identify statistically significant (P < .05) predictors of lateral and prone sleep positioning. Results: Factors associated with both high-risk sleep positions included infant's year of birth, maternal race and ethnicity, maternal county of residence, and maternal parity. Mother's being US-born (versus foreign-born) and male infant sex were predictive only of prone sleep positioning. Having Medicaid as primary insurance, receipt of government benefits, low infant gestational age, and low birth weight were predictive only of lateral sleep positioning. Conclusions: Factors predictive of either high-risk sleep position should be considered when devising public health intervention strategies for the prevention of SIDS.

T2  - Revue Neurologique
AB  - Restless-legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movements and is exacerbated or occurs at night and in the evening. RLS sufferers represent 2 to 3% of the general population in Western countries. Supportive criteria include a family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. The RLS phenotypes include an early onset form, usually idiopathic with a familial history and a late onset form, usually secondary to peripheral neuropathy. Recently, an atypical RLS phenotype without PLM and L-DOPA resistant has been characterized. RLS can occur in childhood and should be distinguished from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, growing pains and sleep complaints in childhood. RLS should be included in the diagnosis of all patients consulting for sleep complaints or discomfort in the lower limbs. It should be differentiated from akathisia, that is, an urge to move the whole body without uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test can detect PLM. Furthermore, an L-DOPA challenge has recently been validated to support the diagnosis of RLS. RLS may cause severe-sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In most cases, RLS is idiopathic. It may also be secondary to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drugs, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. The small-fiber neuropathy can mimic RLS or even trigger it. RLS is associated with many neurological and sleep disorders including Parkinson's disease, but does not predispose to these diseases. The pathophysiology of RLS includes an altered brain-iron metabolism, a dopaminergic dysfunction, a probable role of pain control systems and a genetic susceptibility with nine loci and three polymorphisms in genes serving developmental functions. RLS treatment begins with the elimination of triggering factors and iron supplementation when deficient. Mild or intermittent RLS is usually treated with low doses of L-DOPA or codeine; the first-line treatment for moderate to severe RLS is dopaminergic agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used.

T2  - Breaking the silence: Mental health professionals disclose their personal and family experiences of mental illness.
AB  - This chapter discusses the author's struggle with her father with bipolar disorder. During my second year of college, I went to the university counseling center with what I presumed to be a fairly simple question: "Am I bipolar?" The counselor who had been assigned to me, probably a pre-doctoral clinical psych intern, looked at me askance and asked me to slow down and back up. I had been having what I considered to be mood swings. Sometimes I was really, really cranky, and sometimes nothing could get me down, I usually needed about 9 or 10 hours of sleep to feel rested, but every once in awhile there was a week or two in which I really only needed 5, I cried more easily than other people. Oh, and I was the youngest child of a father who had bipolar disorder. I had been reading and rereading my introductory psychology text: "The age of onset of bipolar disorder is typically in the late teens or early twenties." I was 19, almost 20, I burned the paragraph about the high heritability of bipolar disorder and its cardinal symptoms into my brain. Would I get 'lucky" and only have bipolar type II, without any of the psychosis associated with bipolar I? Or maybe cyclothymia, the low-grade, chronic form of bipolar disorder? Questions such as these peppered my thoughts for weeks. The counselor asked me a lot of questions, trying to determine some other area of stress in my life. I tried valiantly to convince him that classes weren't stressful, that I wasn't pregnant or having unsafe sex and that I wasn't having a fight with my boyfriend. "Isn't there some kind of test?" I asked, still completely naive to how crude the psychological diagnostic system actually remains, "Can't you just check to see if maybe I have it?" He gave me the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, an extremely long personality test used to assess for many areas of psychological functioning, and told me to come back the following week for a consultation.

AB  - Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence, duration and risk factors for benign neonatal sleep myoclonus (BNSM) in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) treated with opioids or sedatives, compared with control infants. Methods: This is a single centre observational case control study. Seventy-eight near term and term infants with neonatal opiate abstinence syndrome confirmed by meconium analysis were included. Exclusion criteria were cerebral malformation, intracranial hemorrhage and perinatal asphyxia. The babies were assessed eight hourly with a modified Finnegan score that included sleep myoclonus. Seventy-eight infants not exposed to opiates during pregnancy, hospitalized for at least 14 days and matched for gestational age were used as controls. Results: The median gestational age was 38 1/7 (95% CI: 35 3/7–41 2/7) weeks, birth weight 2730 (95% CI: 1890–3600) g, umbilical artery pH 7.25 (CI 7.10–7.37) and Apgar score at 5 minutes 9 (95% CI: 7–10). The control infants did not differ in these characteristics. Sleep myoclonus was diagnosed in 52 (67%) of the infants with NAS and 2 (2.6%) of the controls (OR 26 [95% CI: 7–223], p2.5 mmol/L at first occurrence. The neurological examinations as well as cerebral ultrasound scans were normal. An electroencephalogram (EEG) carried out in 18 infants showed no signs of epileptic activity. Conclusion: BNSM has a high incidence in infants with NAS. The diagnosis can be made clinically. In the absence of other neurological symptoms further investigations such as EEG are not necessary and anticonvulsive treatment is not indicated.

AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of alcohol consumption among pregnant women in Japan and its associated factors. Method: 344 institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006. Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. Results: The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6% and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Conclusion: It is important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women.

T2  - Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research
AB  - Study Objectives: Pregnant women have an increased risk of experiencing restless legs syndrome (RLS). Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology. Design: Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin, hemoglobin) and polysomnographic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol. Interventions: N/A. Results: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211±6,397 pg/mL vs. 25,475±7,990 pg/mL, P<0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P<0.05). PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P<0.05); sleep efficiency increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron, ferritin or hemoglobin. Conclusions: RLS in pregnant women goes along with transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

TI  - Euro-American mothers' ethnotheories and practices of self-care: Associations with mood during the perinatal period.
AU  - Mavridis, Caroline Anne
AB  - This study explored self-care needs, practices and relevant contextual factors (e.g., work, infant needs, support and ideas about the mother role), and associations between self-care and mood, among middle-class Euro-American mothers (n = 20). Data were drawn from a larger study of parenting and infant development (C. Super and S. Harkness, Principal Investigators). Data from the third trimester of pregnancy, five days, two weeks, two months and six months postpartum were used. Self-care is understudied in terms of its meanings and the factors that influence it, particularly among non-clinical samples. Self-care may benefit mothers regardless of clinical status. This knowledge contributes to a theoretical understanding of maternal experience and well-being during a period that poses many personal, social and familial challenges for women. The findings also offer information useful to practitioners and programs that serve expectant or early postpartum mothers. The measures consisted of a semi-structured interview and a checklist of 30 mood descriptors, positive and negative, that was administered in mothers' homes at each time point. Interviews focused on daily routines, social support and contacts, general experiences of motherhood, and important things to do for the infant and oneself. The mood checklist included a range of feelings; mothers indicated at the end of each of three daily time allocation diaries the extent to which they had experienced each of the 30 mood states. Results indicated that physical self-care (e.g., sleep) and social engagement were the most common need across time. A diverse range of practices were discussed, but social activities and going "out" were the most widely cited practices. Mothers managed to enact these despite the presence of constraints related to physical and social settings, and employed strategies such as taking the infant along to facilitate social involvement. Physical self-care and quiet or alone time were two needs that in some cases appeared to be unmet. Self-expectations related to the mother role appear likely to have influenced self-care in a negative manner. Physical self-care practices at five days postnatal bore the most prominent associations to positive mood at the group level and when individual mothers were grouped.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Sleep quality seems to be an antecedent to depressive symptoms during pregnancy. We sought to 1) examine the psychometrics of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in pregnancy; 2) examine whether sleep quality predicted increases in depressive symptoms; and 3) compare PSQI scores across 3 or 2 levels of depressive symptoms. Methods: Each of the 252 participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (short form) and a sleep quality measure at mid and late pregnancy. Results: PSQI total scores showed good internal consistency and construct validity. An improved model of the internal structure of the PSQI in pregnancy was found with 1 factor labeled Sleep Efficiency, a second labeled Night and Daytime Disturbances, and an Overall Sleep Quality component associated with, but separate from, both of these 2 factors. Although PSQI scores showed moderate stability over time, sleep disturbance scores increased in late pregnancy. Importantly, PSQI prospectively predicted increases in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the PSQI is useful in pregnancy research. Findings also support the idea that sleep problems are prospective risk factors for increases in depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Practitioners are advised to screen for sleep quality during early pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in asthma patients and can contribute to sleep disruption. The aim of the present study was to determine the time-related distribution of GER events together with their impact on sleep in asthmatic subjects with GER disease symptoms. The inclusion criteria were: 18-65 years, controlled moderate to severe asthma and GER-compatible clinical evidence. The exclusion criteria were: chronic obstructive lung disease, smoking, infections of the upper airways, use of oral corticosteroids, other co-morbidities, pregnancy, sleep-related disorders, night-time shift work, and the use of substances with impact on sleep. Asthmatic patients with nocturnal symptoms were excluded. All-night polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring were recorded simultaneously. Of the 147 subjects selected, 31 patients and 31 controls were included. Seventeen patients were classified as DeMeester positive and 14 as DeMeester negative. Both groups displayed similar outcomes when general variables were considered. Sleep stage modification one minute prior to GER was observed in the DeMeester-positive group. Awakening was the most frequent occurrence at GER onset and during the 1-min period preceding 38% of the nocturnal GER. Sleep stage 2 was also prevalent and preceded 36% of GER events. In the DeMeester-negative group, awakening was the most frequent response before and during GER. Modifications in sleep stages, arousals or awakenings were associated with 75% of the total GER events analyzed during the period of one minute before and after the fall of esophageal pH below 4 in the DeMeester-positive group. These data provide evidence that sleep modifications precede the GER events in asthmatic patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate relationships among women's body attitudes, physical symptoms, self-esteem, depression, and sleep quality during pregnancy. Pregnant women (N = 215) at 15-25 weeks gestation completed a questionnaire including four body image subscales assessing self-reported feeling fat, attractiveness, strength/fitness, and salience of weight and shape. Women reported on 29 pregnancy-related physical complaints, and completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regressions, controlling for retrospective reports of body image, more frequent and intense physical symptoms were related to viewing the self as less strong/fit, and to poorer sleep quality and more depressive symptoms. In a multi-factorial model extending previous research, paths were found from sleep quality to depressive symptoms to self-esteem; self-esteem was found to be a mediator associated with lower scores on feeling fat and salience of weight and shape, and on higher perceived attractiveness.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea and pre-eclampsia: Is there an association?
AU  - Saad, Fairouz Sabah
AB  - Pre-eclampsia is a life threatening disease that is specific for pregnancy. It affects 9% of pregnant population and it has negative implications on the health of the mother and the fetus. It is characterized by high Blood Pressure (equal or above to 140/80mmHg), increased protein in the urine (equal or above .03g/24 hour collection), and general edema. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep breathing disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of breathing cessation accompanied by oxygen desaturation and/or arousal. It occurs in 4% in women and 9% in men and is under diagnosed especially among women. Both pre-eclampsia and OSA share a significant overlap in risk factors especially hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases in general. The objective of this study is to examine the association between pre-eclampsia and OSA and the specific aim is to test the hypothesis that the pre-eclamptic women are at higher risk of OSA than women with normal uncomplicated pregnancies. It is a clinic-based case control study. Cases were all pre-eclamptic patients admitted to University of Louisville (UofL) hospital or attending the high risk maternity clinic between August20-November30, 2007. Controls were healthy pregnant women attending UofL continuity clinic during the same period. Patients were asked to complete three questionnaires: the Berlin questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Fatigue Severity Scale. Demographic data was also collected. Distributions of study subjects with respect to the different variables were calculated. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated for risk of OSA, excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. The results show that pre-eclamptic women are at higher risk of having OSA, excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue than healthy pregnant women. Most demographic characteristics like age, race, height, BMI, weight gain, family history of OSA, previous history of OSA, smoking, and alcohol use were not significant except for county of residence and pre-existing medical condition(s). Large epidemiologic studies with overnight polysomnographic studies (PSG) are needed to confirm this association. If the association is further confirmed by future studies then screening for OSA in pre-eclamptic women may become a part of the routine prenatal check up.

AU  - Brodtkorb, Eylert

T2  - Seizure
AB  - The main concerns associated with epilepsy during pregnancy consist of maternal and fetal risks from uncontrolled seizures, and harmful effects of the treatment on the development of the offspring. Although seizure control is maintained in the majority, worsening occurs in a fraction of childbearing women with epilepsy. As multiple factors associated with pregnancy may have a negative impact on epilepsy, a careful analysis of the situation should be performed in those who deteriorate. Emotional and behavioural influence, including insufficient sleep and treatment non-compliance, as well as physical factors, such as emesis and pelvic distortion, should receive attention. The serum concentrations of almost all antiepileptic drugs decrease during pregnancy, particularly those which are metabolised by glucuronidation. The inter-individual variability is pronounced. In highly protein-bound drugs, such as phenytoin and valproate, unbound drug is less affected than total concentrations. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam concentrations may decrease by more than 50% in the course of pregnancy; monohydroxyoxcarbazepine by up to 30-40%. Appropriate clinical follow-up tailored to individual needs and supported by therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed in pregnant women with epilepsy. Education concerning reproductive issues is an essential part of the epilepsy service to fertile women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Restless legs syndrome: Pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment.
AU  - Satija, Pankaj
AU  - Ondo, William G.
T2  - CNS Drugs
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is clinically defined by the presence of (i) an urge to move the legs with or without an actual paraesthesia; (ii) a worsening of symptoms with inactivity; (iii) improvement with activity; and (iv) a worsening of symptoms in the evening and at night. Patients may use a variety of semantic phrases to describe their symptoms but all must have an urge to move. Most people with RLS also have periodic limb movements during sleep, although this is not part of the clinical diagnostic criteria. RLS is very common. About 10% of all Caucasian populations have RLS, although it may be mild in the majority of cases. Women generally outnumber men by about 2:1. As a general rule, RLS severity worsens through the first seven to eight decades of life, but may actually lessen in old age. The aetiology of RLS is only partly understood. There is a strong genetic component, and several genetic linkages and three causative genes have been identified worldwide. Several medical conditions, including renal failure, systemic iron deficiency and pregnancy, and possibly neuropathy, essential tremor and some genetic ataxias, are also associated with high rates of RLS. In all cases to date, the actual CNS pathology of RLS demonstrates reduced iron stores, in a pattern that suggests that the homeostatic control of iron is altered, not just that there is not enough iron entering the brain. The relationship between reduced CNS iron levels and the clinical phenotype or treatment response to dopaminergics is not known but generates promising speculation. Treatment of RLS is usually rewarding. Most patients respond robustly to dopamine receptor agonists. Over time, response may lessen, or the patients may develop 'augmentation', whereby they have a worsening of symptoms, usually in the form of an earlier onset. Other treatment options include gabapentin, or similar antiepileptic drugs, and opioids. High-dose intravenous iron is a promising but still experimental approach.

TI  - A change in life as experienced by first-time fathers.
AU  - Fägerskiöld, Astrid
T2  - Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences
AB  - Research suggests that the attitude of men towards pregnancy, childbirth and child-caring is different from that of women. Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards breastfeeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses.

AB  - Background: Infants exposed prenatally to alcohol are at increased risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Aim: To examine the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure, sleep, arousal and sleep-related spontaneous motor movements in early infancy. Study design: Low-income women (N = 13) were interviewed regarding pre- and pregnancy rates of alcohol, cigarette smoking and other substance use in the perinatal period. Infants were examined in a laboratory nap study using EEG, videography and actigraphy at 6–8 weeks of age. Estimates of maternal pre- and pregnancy alcohol use were used to divide infants into high vs. low maternal alcohol use groups. Subjects: Mother–infant dyads recruited from a family practice clinic. Outcome measures: Sleep-related spontaneous movements, behavioral state, and maternal assessments of infant alertness and irritability. Results: Pre-pregnancy rates of alcohol consumption including binge drinking correlated with maternal report of poor infant alertness, and increased irritability. High maternal exposure groups showed increased sleep fragmentation, e.g. frequency and duration of wakefulness following sleep onset and decreased active sleep. Bout analysis of the temporal structure of sleep-related spontaneous movements showed significantly reduced bout duration associated with high maternal alcohol use. Conclusion: These results present evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts postnatal sleep organization and suppresses spontaneous movements during sleep, and increased sleep fragmentation promotes sleep deprivation. Results are consistent with the SIDS model of chronic sleep debt and suggest that attenuated sleep-related movements should be examined as an important modulator of cardiorespiratory functions during sleep in high-risk groups.

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Background: Pregnant women's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well known. Fetal movement is thought to be an index of fetal well-being. However, as there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement, psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal well-being have not been done. Aims: To solve these methodological issues, we developed a new sensor with electrostatic capacity that can pick up acceleration of fetal movement. Methods and results: Experiment I: We verified the reliability of our fetal movement recording system. Thirty-two pregnant women (from 19 to 39 weeks of gestation) were asked to lie down on a bed for about 1 h and to press a button as a subjective marker when they felt fetal movement. We simultaneously recorded maternal polysomnograms and fetal movement from the mothers' abdomens using a Medilog recorder. The mean of prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa for agreements, based on time between fetal movement signals recorded and subjective maternal markers, was substantial at 0.75. Experiment II: We recorded seven pregnant women's polysomnograms and fetal movement simultaneously during all-night sleep at home using our sensor during weeks 33 and 36 of gestation. We succeeded in recording maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal movement. The mean value of the number of micro-arousals at 33 weeks was slightly larger than that at 36 weeks. Conclusions: There was a high agreement between subjective maternal markers and fetal movement. Our recording system using the new sensor can be used for home monitoring of fetal movement.

Adult offspring of time-pregnant dams that were given a deficient level of choline (DEF = 0.0 g/kg), sufficient choline (CON = 1.1 g/kg) or supplemental choline (SUP = 3.5 g/kg) in their chow during embryonic days (ED) 12-17 were implanted with an electroencephalograph (EEG) electrode in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in combination with an electromyograph (EMG) electrode patch implanted in the nuchal muscle. Five consecutive 8-h recording sessions revealed differential patterns of EEG activity as a function of awake, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep states and prenatal choline status. The main finding was that SUP rats displayed increased power levels of gamma (30-100 Hz) band oscillations during all phases of the sleep/wake cycle. These findings are discussed within the context of a general review of neuronal oscillations (e.g., delta, theta, and gamma bands) and synchronization across multiple brain regions in relation to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the hippocampus.

T2  - Alcohol and Alcoholism
AB  - Aims: Prenatal exposure to alcohol can have adverse effects on the developing fetus. Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 gkg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltosedextrin (MD); non-intubated control (NIC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to study genetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice. It appears as if the prenatal period in mice, corresponding to organogenesis, is not a sensitive period for producing behavioral deficits following ethanol exposure. It is likely that the first 2 weeks postnatally, corresponding to the brain growth spurt, are more sensitive for producing behavioral effects.

T2  - Bipolar depression: Molecular neurobiology, clinical diagnosis and pharmacotherapy.
T3  - Milestones in drug therapy.
AB  - The treatment of bipolar disorder (BPD) in women is complicated by reproductive life events such as pregnancy and breastfeeding. This presents a clinical challenge to clinicians and patients who must balance risk of recurrent mood episodes against risks of potential teratogenic and adverse side effects of medications. It is important for the clinician and patient to develop an individualized plan of care during conception, pregnancy, delivery and postpartum to ensure maximum safety and minimal risks. Pregnant women with BPD have the same risk of mood episodes as women who are not pregnant. There is clearly an increased risk for the development of mood episodes in the postpartum period — approximately 22—50% of women with BPD will develop postpartum depression (PPD). Risk factors for PPD in women with BPD include having a family history of PPD and depressive symptoms during pregnancy, but this risk can be significantly reduced with prophylactic medications. The risk for postpartum psychosis (PPP) is also significant, and most cases occur in the first 3 days following delivery. Risk factors include a history of an index manic episode, positive family history, and sleep deprivation during delivery. Lithium is the first choice for mood stabilization during pregnancy for women with severe illness. The typical antipsychotics also appear to be relatively safe during pregnancy. Venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazepine, and the tricyclic antidepressants also all appear to be relatively safe in pregnancy. Patients should be monitored carefully during pregnancy. As the pregnancy progresses physiologic changes occur that alter the excretion of drugs and drug levels may change significantly, necessitating dose adjustments. In addition, factors such as vomiting due to morning sickness must be taken into account. Postpartum, women should be closely monitored, in labor and delivery, and at home. Medication changes made during pregnancy may have to be reversed as physiology changes. If women choose to breastfeed, the pediatrician should be part of the clinical team. It is important to use a team approach when treating BPD during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: In utero exposure to smoking is known to adversely affect brain regions involved in behavioral state organization and could therefore interact with the neurophysiological development of neonates. Study Objectives: The present study investigated the effects of prenatal smoking exposure on sleep patterns in the preterm neonate. Design: Overnight sleep patterns were polysomnographically assessed at thermoneutrality. Sleep continuity and structure were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset. The number and duration of body movements were also analyzed. Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France). Participants: Healthy preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 ± 6.0 weeks) were enrolled according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy (control group, n = 19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, Slow, n = 10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, Sheavy, n = 10) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy. Measurements and Results: Neonates born to heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls (–21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls, neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result, more disturbed sleep. Conclusions: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.

T2  - Psychoneuroendocrinology
AB  - Maternal psychological functioning during pregnancy affects both maternal and fetal well-being. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis provides one mechanism through which maternal psychosocial factors may be transduced to the fetus. However, few studies have examined maternal psychological factors or birth outcomes in relation to the diurnal pattern of cortisol across the day. The current study examined maternal psychological well-being, parity status, and birth weight in relation to the maternal cortisol diurnal rhythm in a group of 98 low-risk pregnant women (51 primiparae). At 36 weeks gestation, participants completed both pregnancy-specific and general self-report measures of psychological functioning and provided saliva samples at 8:00, 12:00, and 16:00 h on 2 consecutive working days for the assay of cortisol. The expected diurnal decline in salivary cortisol was observed. Higher trait anxiety was associated with a flatter afternoon decline for all mothers. For primiparae, steeper morning cortisol declines were associated with lower infant birth weight. The findings suggest that regulation of the HPA axis may differ by parity status with downstream implications for fetal growth and development.

Comorbid problems were chronically high anxiety, anger, sleep disturbance, and pain scores. Less optimal outcomes for the depressed women included lower gestational age and lower birthweight of their newborns. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Feldman, Ruth
T2  - Current Directions in Psychological Science
AB  - Synchrony--a construct used across multiple fields to denote the temporal relationship between events--has been applied to the study of mother-infant interaction and is suggested here as a framework for the study of interpersonal relationships. Defined as the temporal coordination of micro-level social behavior, parent-infant synchrony is charted in its development across infancy from the initial consolidation of biological rhythms during pregnancy to the emergence of symbolic exchange between parent and child. Synchrony is shown to depend on physiological mechanisms supporting bond formation in mammals--particularly physiological oscillators and neuroendocrine systems such as those involving the hormone oxytocin. Developmental outcomes of the synchrony experience are observed in the domains of self-regulation, symbol use, and the capacity for empathy across childhood and adolescence. Specific disruptions to the parameters of synchrony that may be observed in various pathological conditions, such as prematurity or maternal affective disorder, are detailed. A time-based, micro-analytic behavioral approach to the study of human relationship may offer new insights on intersubjectivity across the lifespan.

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Objective: To identify biological and socioeconomic factors associated with the neurological development of Mexican infants born at term, as measured by brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs). Subjects and Methods: We conducted a cohort study among 76 women with low risk pregnancies recruited in their third trimester of pregnancy and followed their infants until 12 months of age. BAEP tests were conducted on the infants before 3 months of age during physiologic sleep, using 100 msec bipolar clicks. Maternal dietary intake was evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. Two BAEP groups (short latency, long latency) were identified by cluster analysis. The association between BAEP group and maternal PUFAs was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic and biological factors. Results: Short latency BAEPs were associated with a maternal diet rich in arachidonic acid (OR = 3.63, 95% CI 1.23-10.67) after adjusting for age (in days) sex, head circumference and gestational age but was not significantly associated to a maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Conclusions: Our results suggest the importance of arachidonic acid intake during pregnancy for short latency BAEPs and adequate fetal myelination.

AU  - Brunton, P. J.

T2  - Journal of Neuroendocrinology
AB  - Over the past 40 years, it has been recognised that the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis undergoes adaptations through pregnancy and lactation that might contribute to avoidance of adverse effects of stress on the mother and offspring. The extent of the global adaptations in the HPA axis has been revealed and the underlying mechanisms investigated within the last 20 years. Both basal, including the circadian rhythm, and stress-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone and glucocorticoid secretory patterns are altered. Throughout most of pregnancy, and in lactation, these changes predominantly reflect reduced drive by the cortico-tropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurones in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN). An accompanying profound attenuation of HPA axis responses to a wide variety of psychological and physical stressors emerges after mid-pregnancy and persists until the end of lactation. Central to this suppression of stress responsiveness is reduced activation of the pPVN CRF neurones. This is consequent on the reduced effectiveness of the stimulation of brainstem afferents to these CRF neurones (for physical stressors) and of altered processing by limbic structures (for emotional stressors). The mechanism of reduced CRF neurone responses to physical stressors in pregnancy is the suppression of noradrenaline release in the PVN by an up-regulated endogenous opioid mechanism, which is induced by neuroactive steroid produced from progesterone. By contrast, in lactation suckling the young provides a neural stimulus that dampens the HPA axis circadian rhythm and reduces stress responses. Reduced noradrenergic input activity is involved in reduced stress responses in lactation, although central prolactin action also appears important. Such adaptations limit the adverse effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure on the foetus(es) and facilitate appropriate metabolic and immune responses.

TI  - Maternal cortisol as a mediator of prenatal stress and infant regulation development.
AU  - Jones, Shallimar M.
AB  - Maternal experience of stress during pregnancy can have a lasting impact on infant regulation development. Research suggests that the Hypothalamic Adrenal (HPA) axis transmits maternal stress to the fetus and that these effects can be observed in infant regulatory behaviors such as temperament and sleep patterns. However, examining prenatal maternal cortisol as a mediator of prenatal maternal stress and infant regulation has not been observed in human populations. Therefore, the present study investigated this relationship using a prospective design with a community sample of 92 participants in the 3rd trimester of their pregnancies. Participants were interviewed a second time when the infants were 3 months old. A.M. and P.M. salivary maternal cortisol and self report measures for prenatal stress (depression, anxiety, life stress, daily hassles, and perceived stress) and pregnancy related conditions were examined at Time 1. At Time 2, self report measures of postnatal stress (depression, anxiety, life stress, daily hassles, and perceived stress), general health, infant sleep and temperament with the Infant Behavior Scale were completed. Hierarchical Linear Regression controlling for postnatal stress, showed that cortisol was not a significant mediator. However, prenatal stress did predict aspects of infant regulation. Specifically, mental stress predicted infant activity (beta = -.24, p<.05) and sleep (beta = .40, p<.05) and life stress predicted attention (beta = -.24, p<.05). Postnatal analyses (controlling for prenatal stress) showed that, perceived stress experienced by the mother directly (beta = .21, p <.05) and indirectly through parenting effects (beta = -.24, p<.05) attention. Implications from this study not only highlight the need for further research on the role of cortisol as a mediator of prenatal stress and infant regulation, but also the need to incorporate these findings into clinical and physical assessments for earlier identification of pregnant women whose children may be at risk for possible negative developmental consequences.

TI  - Mindfulness-based yoga during pregnancy: A pilot study examining relationships between stress, anxiety, sleep, and pain.
AU  - Beddoe, Amy E.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a "mindful-yoga" intervention for healthy pregnant women that blended elements of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Iyengar style prenatal yoga, on stress, anxiety, sleep, and pain; to estimate statistical power and sample size for a larger study; and to establish whether the treatment is effective for second or third trimester women. The effects of variables on mindful-yoga were studied over time, comparing baseline (Time1) and post-intervention (Time2) data in a single treatment group of 19 English-speaking nulliparous women with healthy pregnancies, 17 of whom adhered to the intervention that met for seven weekly sessions. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, correlations, parametric and nonparametric paired comparisons, and effect sizes. Participants were well-educated, middleclass, and planning vaginal birth. Although no one was currently being treated for psychiatric disorders, nearly 30% had a history of depression or anxiety. The intervention resulted in higher scores for two facets of mindfulness (Observing and Nonreacting). From Time1 to Time2, third trimester participants demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress and trait anxiety. Second trimester women demonstrated improvements in pain and sleep. In contrast, the third trimester group experienced worse pain and sleep as pregnancy progressed. To control for gestation, Time1 data for the 8 women who began mindful-yoga in the third trimester (26.5 weeks +2.3) were compared with Time2 data for the 9 women who began mindful-yoga in the second trimester (27.1 weeks +4.1). Second trimester women at Time2 experienced improved sleep (fewer night awakenings and less wake time during the night) as measured by wrist actigraphy compared to third trimester group baseline data. This study demonstrated important clinical improvements in sleep and pain for women who began mindful-yoga in their second trimester. Mindful-yoga intervention merits further research for reducing perceived stress and anxiety and second trimester sleep enhancement and pain reduction. The mechanisms of mindful-yoga on stress appraisal, anxiety, sleep, and pain were not clearly linked to mindfulness, and further studies are required to develop theoretical linkages between mindful-yoga and symptom reduction during pregnancy.

TI  - Predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms among African American HIV-positive women.
AU  - Sublette, Nina Katherine
AB  - This descriptive correlation study had four purposes: describe depressive and anxiety symptom levels in pregnant and non-pregnant African American (AA) HIV-positive women, examine the association between underlying vulnerabilities and depressive symptoms in HIV-positive AA women, determine the association between underlying vulnerabilities and anxiety symptoms in AA HIV-positive women, and determine the predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms among African American HIV-positive women. A convenience sample of 80 African American HIV-positive women was recruited from university-based obstetrics/-gynecology and infectious disease practices in a large metropolitan city in the Mid-South. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Edinburgh Postnatal depression Scale (EPDS). Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). An investigator-developed demographic data form was used to obtain patient characteristics including data about inherited and acquired vulnerabilities. Inherited vulnerabilities included family history of mood disorders and family history of alcohol and/or drug use. Acquired vulnerabilities included educational level, income level, alcohol and/or use, HIV disclosure status, sleep quality, and history of sexual assault. The stress diathesis theory provided the conceptual basis for the study. The sample consisted of both pregnant (n = 20) and non-pregnant (n = 60) women. Participants were typically single (57.5%), middle-aged (33.21 + 10.7 years), and had completed high school (30%) or some college (35%). Poverty was prevalent in the sample, with 70.5% reporting annual household incomes below $10,000. Most women (92.5%) had disclosed their HIV status. Almost half of the sample (42%) reported a history of sexual assault. Substance abuse was higher in the non-pregnant group of women (40%) than the non-pregnant group (5%) of women. Median depressive symptom scores for the total sample were mildly elevated. Median anxiety symptom scores for the total sample illustrated little or no anxiety symptoms. Poor sleep quality was prevalent in both groups and was associated with elevated CES-D, EPDS, and BAI scores in both groups of women. Family history of mood disorders was associated with elevated CES-D scores in the group of pregnant women, and elevated BAI scores in both groups. HIV disclosure was associated with elevated CES-D scores in the pregnant group, and substance use with elevated CES-D scores, in the non-pregnant group. Non-pregnant HIV-positive women had higher depressive symptom scores on both the CES-D and EPDS when compared to pregnant HIV-positive women. Regression analyses were performed to determine which independent variables predicted elevated depressive and anxiety symptom scores. Substance use and poor sleep quality were statistically significant predictors, ac counting for 55% of the variance in CES-D scores, 43% of the variance in EPDS scores, and 53% of the variance in BAI scores. Future studies should include testing interventions that improve sleep quality. Untreated mood disorders are problematic in HIV-positive patients, as depression is associated with decreased adherence to highly active antiretroviral medications. Ongoing assessments of depressive and anxiety symptoms are necessary, as clinically significant levels resulting in referrals were warranted.

AB  - For the first time, the relationship between depressive symptoms and sleep quality was explored prospectively during pregnancy. Participants (n = 273) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Beck Depression Inventory at three 8-week intervals, starting from 15-23 weeks gestation. In addition to sleep quality and depression remaining relatively stable during pregnancy, findings revealed that sleep quality earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy (after controlling for prior depression levels). In contrast, there was no evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy impacted on sleep quality later on. Given that depressive symptomatology can lead to major depression and given the prevalence of pre- and postnatal depression, our findings suggest that screening for sleep problems during pregnancy may be of clinical significance.

The prevalence of RLS among the women was 2.9%. The prevalence by age group exhibited a U-shaped curve with the value for those in their thirties as the minimum. The prevalence became more than twice higher in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were stronger associations between RLS and the third trimester of pregnancy, multipara, smoking, subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, early morning awakening and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.92, 0.76, 1.54, 1.68, 2.44, 1.80, 1.89, respectively). The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women in Japan was not as high as previously reported, similar to that for the general Japanese population. As the prevalence of RLS is lower than that in Western countries, genetic backgrounds may contribute more to the observed differences than pregnancy does. In this study, like others, the prevalence of RLS increased during the third trimester of pregnancy, and strong associations were observed between RLS and difficulty initiating sleep and between RLS and difficulty maintaining sleep.

AB  - Objectives: To describe different sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness in a French population of randomly selected young women during pregnancy and to evaluate the frequency of these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: Cross-sectional design with retrospective survey of pre-pregnancy, symptoms and prospective survey of current symptoms. Mothers were interviewed during pregnancy with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep before pregnancy and to assess alterations in their sleep according to the trimester. Results: 871 pregnant women completed the questionnaire. The rate of pregnant women with insomnia with non-refreshing sleep and frequent awakenings increases during the second and the third trimester reaching more than 75% of the women, essentially due to an urge to urinate, movements of the fetus, backache and restless legs syndrome. Snoring also increases throughout the pregnancy with more than 18% of them snoring every night. Conversely, more than 75% of the women complained of a decrease in their vigilance and a need to nap inreased during the pregnancy. Conclusions: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy and increases throughout the pregnancy, except for excessive daytime sleepiness which was more frequent during the first trimester.

AB  - Several modifiable pre- and postnatal determinants of childhood overweight are known, but no one has examined how they influence risk of overweight in combination. We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex ≥95th percentile) at age 3. We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child pairs breastfed for <12m, and 31 % of infants slept <12h/day. Among the 3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model, the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact on prevention of childhood overweight. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes for women during pregnancy and the postnatal period.
AU  - Jomeen, Julie
AU  - Martin, Colin R.
T2  - Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice
AB  - Rationale: Psychological factors are acknowledged to impact on pregnancy, birth, neonatal outcomes and maternal mental health. The importance of psychological well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes. Methods: 165 antenatal women were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14 days and 6 months postnatal. Results: No significant differences between groups were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible, however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can affect psychological status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although fatigue is a common experience for pregnant women and new mothers, few measures of fatigue have been validated for use with this population. To address this gap, the authors assessed psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, which was used in 2 independent samples of pregnant women. Results indicated that the psychometric properties of the scale were very similar across samples and time points. The scale possesses a high level of internal consistency, has good convergent validity with measures of sleep quality and depression, and discriminates well from a measure of social support. Contrary to previous evaluations of the MAF, data strongly suggest that the scale represents a unidimensional construct best represented by a single factor. Results indicate that the MAF is a useful measure of fatigue among pregnant and postpartum women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Epigenetic programming of the stress response in male and female rats by prenatal restraint stress.
AU  - Darnaudéry, Muriel
AU  - Maccari, Stefania
T2  - Brain Research Reviews
AB  - Exposure to hostile conditions results in a series of coordinated responses aimed at enhancing the probability of survival. The activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a pivotal role in the stress response. While the short-term activation of the HPA axis allows adaptive responses to the challenge, in the long run this can be devastating for the organism. In particular, life events occurring during the perinatal period have strong long-term effects on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to stressors. In male and female rats exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS), these effects include a long-lasting hyperactivation of the HPA response associated with an altered circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, male animals exhibit sleep disturbances. In males, these HPA dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young, adult and aged animals, thus suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after exposure to an intense inescapable footshock, female PRS rats durably exhibit a blunted corticosterone secretion response to stress. In male PRS rats exposed to an alcohol challenge, the HPA axis is similarly hyporesponsive. Rats exposed to PRS also show behavioral disturbances. Both male and female PRS rats show high anxiety levels and depression-like behavior during adulthood, although some studies suggest that female PRS rats present low anxiety levels. With ageing, male and female PRS rats exhibit memory impairments in hippocampus-dependent tasks, while female PRS rats improve their memory performance during adulthood. The gender effect on behavior seems to be related to a reduction in hippocampal plasticity in male PRS rats, and an increase in female PRS rats. Despite the permanent imprinting induced by early stress, the dysfunctions observed after PRS can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategies such as environmental enrichment or antidepressive and neurotrophic treatments. Mechanisms underlying the effects of PRS on the offspring remain largely unknown. However, previous studies have demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during pregnancy play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported in male offspring. Finally, gestational stress has long-lasting effects on the HPA axis and on behavior in the dams. Alterations in maternal behavior could thus also make a strong contribution to the long-term effects of PRS, through epigenetic mechanisms.

T2  - Acta Paediatrica
AB  - Aim: To analyse the importance of mothers’ smoking during pregnancy and/or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in early childhood for children’s health and well-being at the age of 3 years. Methods: Four groups from a population based cohort (n = 8850) were compared: children with nonsmoking mother during pregnancy and nonsmoking parents at the age of 3 years (n = 7091); children with only foetal exposure (n = 149); children exposed only postnatally (n = 895) and children exposed both pre- and postnatally (n = 595). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Children exposed both pre- and postnatally had more wheezing (1.14; 1.07–1.21) and rhinitis (1.16; 1.06–1.26), used more cough-mixture (1.07 ; 1.01–1.14) and broncodilatating drugs (1.08; 1.02–1.15) and suffered more from excessive crying (1.31; 1.13–1.51) and irritability (1.27; 1.09–1.48) compared to children with nonsmoking parents. Children exposed only postnatally had more rhinitis (1.24; 1.12–1.37), used more cough-mixture (1.14; 1.05–1.29) and suffered more from poor sleep (1.26; 1.07–1.47) than children of nonsmoking parents. Children with prenatal exposure only used more broncodilatating drugs (1.45; 1.03–2.04) and suffered more from poor sleep (2.06; 1.09–3.87). Conclusion: Health differences, small but significant, indicate that prenatal and/or postnatal ETS exposure alone, or in combination, seems to interfere with child health, supporting the importance of zero tolerance. However, as most smoking parents in Sweden try to protect their children from ETS exposure, the results also might indicate that protective measures are worthwhile.

AB  - Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Subjects and methods: Between April 2005 and March 2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI) > 25, AHI < 5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI < 25, AHI < 5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson's and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP. Results: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25 ± 0.23, 0.58 ± 0.55, and 0.51 ± 0.37 mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n = 23), obese non-apneics (n = 45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n = 29), respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p = 0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p = 0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r = 0.22, p = 0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r = 0.10, p = 0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (β = 0.02, p = 0.01). Conclusions: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To examine patterns of postpartum parental sleep and levels of fatigue at 2, 12, and 20 weeks following hospital discharge of newborn twins. Design: Descriptive longitudinal pilot study. Setting: Recruitment from 2 hospital postpartum units. Data collected in parents’ homes. Participants: Eight primiparous parents caring for twins delivered at 33 to 38 weeks gestation. Methods: Home visits to deliver and retrieve study equipment: wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries to measure sleep, standardized instrument to measure fatigue, and an investigator-developed form to measure demographics and related variables. Results: Fathers had significantly less night sleep (5.4 hours) and less 24 hour sleep (5.8 hours) than mothers (6.2 and 6.9 hours, respectively) at 2 weeks after twins were discharged. Sleep efficiency increased significantly over time in a linear fashion for both parents. Morning and evening fatigue levels were not significantly different between parents and remained constant over time. Conclusion: Pilot data suggest that mothers and especially fathers of twins experience sleep disturbances after discharge of their twins. Further study is needed to more fully describe the evolution of sleep patterns and clarify factors that influence sleep in parents of twins.

AB  - This book's 13 chapters offer a step-by-step method of differential diagnosis for some of the most common sleep complaints encountered in today's professional clinical practices. After a brief overview of sleep physiology and pathology, each of the chapters addresses the symptoms, tests, and various behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for a wide range of sleep conditions. The latter chapters discuss sleep disorders in distinct patient demographics—specifically children, women (during pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause) and the increasing population of older adults. The manual also includes a variety of figures and tables throughout, as well as several helpful patient handouts. No other clinical text provides such a breadth of information in such a compact, easy-to-carry volume. By classifying sleep disorders by clinical presentation, patient demographic, and related conditions, the Clinical Manual for Evaluation and Treatment of Sleep Disorders offers clinicians and students a valuable reference tool in diagnosis and treatment.

T2  - Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics
AB  - Case: Sophia is a 3-year-old girl who was brought to her pediatrician by her parents who were concerned about inconsolable night-time awakening. Her mother indicated that she has frequent (>6), early nocturnal awakenings accompanied by screaming and crying lasting up to 1 hour since her birth. These episodes increased in intensity and frequency in the past year since the birth of her brother. With a bedtime routine (a cup of water by bedside with a washcloth and touching mother's nose, chin, and cheeks), Sophia falls asleep easily; however, within 1 hour she awakes screaming and flailing unaware of her surroundings and unable to be comforted. There are no tonic-clonic movements. Prior interventions, including a sleep coach and "letting Sophia cry it out," did not change her sleep pattern. Sophia's mother reports that she needs to be on a specific daily routine including set times for awakening, activity, snacks, naps, and meals. Diversion from the routine and separation from her mother results in a tantrum (kicking, hitting, screaming, and inconsolability) often lasting more than 30 minutes. Sophia was born after an uncomplicated 37-week gestation. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia required readmission for 24 hours of phototherapy; serum bilirubin levels were performed daily for 3 weeks after discharge. At 6 weeks, daily episodes of screaming, inconsolability, forceful vomiting, and inability to sleep led to a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Medication trials were not successful, but the symptoms resolved by 5 months. Formula intolerance and difficulty swallowing and chewing different textures of solid food occurred in the first year. Occupational therapy was of "no benefit"; Sophia was overwhelmed by the activity and took a long time to warm up to the therapist. Her texture aversion resolved by 2 years of age. She prefers one-on-one play and has minimal interactions with other children. She has met all her developmental milestones appropriately and has no other health issues. Sophia lives with her parents and infant brother. There is a maternal family history of insomnia and sleep walking and a paternal history of sleep walking. Her mother adheres to a strict daily schedule. Sleep deprivation, different parental child-rearing practices, social isolation, and lack of quality parent time were all identified by the mother as significant marital stressors. During the office visit, Sophia required 30 minutes to warm up and smile, and over 60 minutes before she spoke her first word. Physical examination was normal (including growth measurements) and the developmental examination was age-appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment, she was engaging, playful, and cooperative with the pediatrician. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Gender plays a significant role in the development of major depression, a fact evidenced by lifetime prevalence rates as high as 21% in women compared with 12.7% in men (Kessler et al., 1994; Alonso et al., 2004). Although the diagnostic criteria for depression are the same for both sexes, women with depression more frequently experience guilt, anxiety, increased sleep, weight gain and comorbid eating disorders. In addition, women with bipolar disorder spend more symptomatic time in the depressive state compared to men with the same diagnosis (Perugi et al., 1990). The role of gender in bipolar disorder has not been studied to the same extent as has gender in other chronic mental illnesses (Leibenluft, 1996; Hendrick et al., 2000, 2003; Blehar et al., 1998; Weissman et al., 1988) but there are some specific features of bipolar disorder in women that set them apart from other patient populations. This chapter discusses bipolar disorder across the female reproductive cycle; treatment strategies for menstrual related mood changes; pregnancy and treatment strategies during pregnancy; pharmacotherapy during pregnancy and the postpartum; menopause; treatment strategies for menopausal related mood changes; and future directions.

AB  - The decisions of if and when to have a first child are very important for any woman or couple. This paper develops a model to examine when a woman should begin trying to conceive, which depends on the personal circumstances and values of each woman. The model incorporates separate objectives for a woman's professional, social, and family aspects of life and integrates them into a quality-of-life function that includes the changing relative importance of these aspects with age over a woman's life. Descriptions of the relative quality of each of these three aspects of a woman's life are modeled over time for different cases. One case involves no child and other cases involve the woman giving birth at different ages from 21 to 50. The probabilities of conceiving when trying, as a function of a woman's age, are included. The relative pros and cons of waiting until the late thirties to have a child to avoid perceived detrimental impacts on one's career or social life are investigated. Several illustrations are included in the paper to demonstrate insights that can be generated using the model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Treatment in Psychiatry begins with a hypothetical case illustrating a problem in current clinical practice. The authors review current data on prevalence, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. The article concludes with the authors' treatment recommendations for cases like the one presented. The current article discusses two case studies. The first is a 30-year old woman, 6 weeks postpartum, who feels as if a "a curtain descended upon" her. Her symptoms include low mood, tearfulness, decreased sleep and appetite, significant weight loss, and anhedonia. She feels she cannot care for her son properly and has intrusive thoughts that some unspecified harm may come to him. The other case study looks at a 27-year-old woman with a history of recurrent major depression since age 18 presents for a consultation during her second trimester of pregnancy. The patient has a history of nonresponse to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been hospitalized twice for severe depressive episodes.

AB  - The IV All-Russian Symposium on Slow Oscillatory Processes in the Human Body and the II School/Seminar on Nonlinear Dynamics in Physiology and Medicine were held at the Laboratory of the Physiology of Slow Wave Processes. The scope of the symposium and school/seminar was substantially widened compared to previous symposia. The lecture by N.I. Kolchanov (Novosibirsk) dealt with the molecular genetic aspects of the complexity of, and control over, physiological processes. The circadian rhythm gene networks consisting of hierarchically organized oscillators were considered in terms of the symposium subject, with special emphasis on the generation and synchronization of oscillatory processes at the molecular genetic and physiological levels. The concluding part of the lecture concerned the molecular epidemiology of lipid metabolism. The factors of the current epidemic of obesity in the United States were discussed. The results of the spectral analysis of the heart rate wave dynamics in women were used to show the approaches to noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and prediction of pathological processes and complications of pregnancy and childbirth, including those related to the development of energy deficiencies in the mother. The achievements of Russian researchers serve as the basis for large-scale clinical implication of the promising developments in the field of functional diagnosis based on the slow-wave analyses of hart rate and other physiological processes.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurological disorder. It usually appears when patients try to relax in the evening or to sleep at night with, sometimes, unpleasant restless feelings in their legs and/or need to move them which can be relieved by movement or walking. RLS is a very common condition and, often, disabling; epidemiological studies suggest that it affects 5-10% of the general population in the United States and Northern Europe. It occurs typically in adults and elders, but it can affect also children. The prevalence and severity of RLS increase with age and its incidence in women is the double than in men. The most frequent form of RLS is idiopathic, but it can occur as a consequence of or in association with a series of different clinical conditions, such as iron deficiency, pregnancy, renal failure, spinocerebellar ataxia, spinal stenosis, polyneuropathies, lumbosacral radiculopathy, and Parkinson's disease. The current therapeutic approach is based on dopamine-agonists which are usually effective for the relief of the subjective symptoms and motor disturbances which precede and accompany RLS patients' sleep. The knowledge of this syndrome is important for the real possibility to modify positively its disturbing symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Geary, Nori
T2  - Appetite
AB  - Richter fully appreciated the fundamental biological importance of sex differences, in particular the challenges of female reproductive function to the two classes of behavior that most engaged him, endogenous rhythms and "self-regulatory" behaviors. Indeed, his contributions in these areas justify honoring him as one of the founders of behavioral neuroendocrinology. During the 1920s Richter, together with Wang, Kinder and other students, performed elegant phenomenological and mechanistic studies of sex differences in rats' spontaneous locomotor activity, nest building, and food intake. All of these behaviors display rhythms entrained to the ovarian cycle in female rats, and Richter's analyses of them formed the bases of many current areas of behavioral neuroscience. Slightly later, Richter made fundamentally important discoveries related to nutrient self-selection in pregnant and lactating rats, including changes in micronutrient and macronutrient selection. These data played a major role in the development of his concept of behavioral regulation of homeostasis. Unfortunately, some of these discoveries are rarely recalled. This is both historically regrettable and potentially an impediment to contemporary research progress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to modulate arousal, waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, especially at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 350 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, 3 times per day, from day E14 until birth, and the pups allowed to mature. Intracellularly recorded PPN neurons in 12-21 day rat brainstem slices were tested for intrinsic membrane properties, including the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih, which is known to drive oscillatory activity. Type II (A-current) PPN cells from 12-16 day old offspring of treated animals had a 1/2max Ih amplitude of (mean ± SE) 4.1 ± 0.9 mV, while 17-21 day cells had a higher 1/2max Ih of 9.9 ± 1.1 mV (p h of 1.3 ± 0.1 mV, which was lower (p h of 3.3 ± 0.3 mV, which was also lower (p < 0.01) than in cells from prenatally treated offspring. In addition, changes in resting membrane potential [control -65. ± 0.9 mV (n=32); exposed -55.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p < 0.0001)], and action potential (AP) threshold [control -56.5 ± 0.7 mV (n = 32), exposed -47.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p < 0.0001)], suggest that prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke induced marked changes in cells in the cholinergic arm of the RAS, rendering them more excitable. Such data could partially explain the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders.

TI  - RLS patients: Who are they?
AU  - Schapira, A. H. V.
T2  - European Journal of Neurology
AB  - Four essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been identified. Patients experience an urge to move the legs, which typically begins or worsens during periods of rest. The symptoms are at least partially relieved by movement, and are typically worse in the evening and night than in the day. All four criteria are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RLS. In addition, a family history of RLS, the presence of periodic leg movements in sleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic therapy are useful supportive clinical features to confirm the diagnosis. Whilst many cases of RLS are idiopathic, secondary RLS is often observed in pregnant women, patients who have severe renal dysfunction, or in those with iron deficiency. Several other conditions have symptoms similar to those of RLS, but a detailed patient history is usually sufficient to identify these differential diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of RLS should result in considerable improvements in patients quality of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In rodents, during late embryonic and early neonatal development, circadian rhythms develop in synchrony with those of their mothers, which in turn are synchronized with the environmental photoperiod. This paper examines the effect of maternal ganglionectomy (pineal gland sympathetic denervation) or extirpation of the pineal gland on pups' drinking rhythms, a behavior that is continuously monitored in individual animals starting after weaning and studied up to 3 weeks later. Maternal ganglionectomy or pinealectomy performed on the 7th day of gestation significantly disrupts rat pups' drinking behavior, within and among litters. In both treatments, circadian rhythm characteristics of the free-running period (tau), phase, amplitude and alpha were significantly altered compared to those of the control pups born from sham-operated mothers. With the exception of the alpha component, both maternal treatments have similar effects. When melatonin was given to the mothers instead of the endogenous pineal secretory activity for 5 days during the late period of gestation, this treatment reversed the effects of maternal ganglionectomy and pinealectomy. These observations, together with previous studies of our group, indicate that the maternal superior cervical ganglia and pineal gland are necessary components of the mechanism for maternal synchronization, and that maternal melatonin may, directly or indirectly, affect the performance of the pups' central oscillator during early pup rat development.

AB  - Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient.

TI  - Onset of sentience: The potential for suffering in fetal and newborn farm animals.
AU  - Mellor, David J.
AU  - Diesch, Tamara J.
T2  - Applied Animal Behaviour Science
AB  - Sentience and consciousness are prerequisites of suffering. Thus, animals must have sufficiently sophisticated neural mechanisms to receive sensory information and to transduce this information into sensations, and they must also be conscious to be able to perceive those sensations. Moreover, those sensations must be sufficiently noxious or aversive to cause suffering. The neural apparatus of embryos and fetuses of farm animals is inadequate to support sentience for at least the first half of pregnancy, but the required structures and mechanisms do develop by the time of birth. Thus, although one of the preconditions for suffering is satisfied shortly before birth, the embryo and fetus are apparently never conscious for the following reasons. The embryo-fetus initially does not have brain structures that are functionally capable of supporting consciousness, and subsequently, when the fetal brain might have that capability, it displays electrical activity indicating a continuous state of sleep and therefore unconsciousness. Furthermore, the fetus is apparently actively maintained in sleep-like states by several endogenous neuroinhibitory mechanisms which involve adenosine (a potent neuroinhibitory and sleep inducing agent), allopregnanolone and pregnanolone (two neurosteroidal anaesthetics), prostaglandin D₂ (a potent sleep-inducing hormone), a placental neural inhibitor, warmth, buoyancy and cushioned tactile stimulation. Consciousness evidently appears for the first time only after birth. This results from a substantial withdrawal of the neuroinhibitors, especially adenosine, and the involvement of neuroactivators including 17β-oestradiol (a potent neuroactive steroid with widespread excitatory effects in the brain), noradrenaline (released from excitatory locus coeruleus nerves that extend throughout the brain), and a barrage of novel sensory information associated with the newborn's first exposure to air, gravity, hard surfaces, unlimited space and, usually, to cold ambient conditions. We conclude that the embryo and fetus cannot suffer before or during birth. Furthermore, we conclude that suffering can only occur in the newborn when the onset of breathing oxygenates its tissues sufficiently to substantially reduce the dominant adenosine inhibition of brain electrical activity. The implications of these observations for managing fetuses and newborns in ways that minimise suffering are considered briefly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M = 20 weeks). They were designated depressed (N = 172) or nondepressed (N = 258) on the Structured Clinical Interview of Depression (SCID) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). They were given a second assessment when they were approximately 32 weeks gestational age. At both assessments they were given self-report measures (CES-D, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the State Anger Inventory) and provided urine samples for assays of cortisol, catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) and serotonin. They were also given the VITAS scale for lower back pain and leg pain and a sleep disturbance scale. The stability of mood states and biochemistry across pregnancy (20 and 32 weeks) were assessed inasmuch as mood states, and biochemistry have been noted to predict prematurity and low birthweight. Significant correlations were noted for all variables except serotonin. Relationships between mood states and biochemistry were also noted but only between cortisol and depression, cortisol and anxiety, and epinephrine and anxiety. Significant stability was noted between the 20-week measures and the 32-week measures including depression, anxiety, anger, and cortisol. These were, in turn, correlated with each other and with, low back pain, leg pain, and sleep disturbance. These data suggest the stability of mood states and cortisol across pregnancy.

AU  - Yamazaki, Akemi
T2  - Sleep and Biological Rhythms
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the association between the regularity of sleep patterns for first-time Japanese mothers in the early postpartum period and the sleep and wake activity of their infants and partners. Longitudinal time-series studies of 101 healthy Japanese childbearing couples were conducted between May 2002 and January 2003. Data were obtained from couples at 32-6 weeks pregnancy and 4-5 weeks after birth. The questionnaire packet for each father and mother included a demographic questionnaire, a sleep-wake log for 7 days, a social rhythm metric for 7 days and a morningness-eveningness questionnaire. A four-stage hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed in which the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength was the dependent variable. The variance in postpartum sleep-wake rhythm strength for first-time mothers was explained by three predictor variables. Household income, the mother's chronotype during pregnancy and the father's daily social rhythm at 4-5 weeks after birth made unique contributions to the variance (24.7%) in the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks postpartum. A mother's own tendency to be a morning or evening chronotype and the regularity of the father's daily schedule of activities appear to influence first-time mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength during early postpartum recovery more than disruptions from the infant's sleep-wake activity itself. Health-care providers should counsel couples on how factors associated with the parents themselves may impact on the regularity of a mother's sleep patterns.

T2  - Obesity
AB  - Objective: To examine the extent to which maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits are associated with obesity and overweight in 5-year-old Japanese children. Research Method and Procedures: We studied 1417 mother-child pairs enrolled in Project Enzan--a prospective cohort study. The dependent variables, childhood overweight and obesity, were defined with an international cut-off value. Maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits were used as independent variables. Results: Maternal smoking habits were associated with overweight in the 5-year-old children [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 4.11]. Maternal sleep duration of ≥8 h/d negatively affected childhood overweight (adjusted OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.04). Children whose mothers skipped breakfast were likely to become overweight (adjusted OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.77). The results of childhood obesity analysis were similar to those of childhood overweight analysis. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that there are effects of smoking during early pregnancy and other maternal lifestyle habits on the onset of childhood obesity in Japan. Therefore, interventions in maternal lifestyle habits are required to prevent childhood obesity, and these interventions should be initiated before pregnancy.

AB  - Bed-sharing among Barbadian mothers and infants was studied in relationship to maternal and infant characteristics. This prospective study followed 226 healthy, well-nourished mother-infant dyads at birth, 7 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum. At each age, approximately half of the infants shared the same beds as their mothers. Bed-sharing was associated with demographic characteristics, especially fewer home conveniences, and also maternal characteristics, including less information seeking by the mother and younger maternal age at first pregnancy. Bed-sharing was also associated with lower infant birth weights. Maternal moods were significantly correlated with bed-sharing, such that mothers who reported having more despair and anxiety were also more likely to sleep with their infants. Bed-sharing was also significantly associated with increased breastfeeding at all infant ages, but this relationship was no longer significant once the effects of maternal moods were controlled. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing maternal moods in studies evaluating the risk and benefits of bed-sharing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Background: Fetal behavioral states are important indicators of fetal physiology and pathology associated to typical fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. Aim: To provide linear and nonlinear analysis of FHR patterns associated with fetal behavioral states regarding a better understanding of these states and patterns. Study design and subjects: Fifty FHR tracings from normal term pregnancies with a median duration of 40.3 min were acquired with the SisPorto® 2.01 system for computerized analysis of cardiotocograms. Each tracing was divided into consecutive 10-minute segments and each segment was classified by two experts as pattern A, B, C or D. Outcome measures: Linear and nonlinear indices were computed in each segment, namely mean FHR, long-term irregularity index (LTI), very low (VLF), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency spectral indices, approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn). Kappa statistic (κ) and proportions of agreement (Pa) were used for assessment of inter-observer agreement. Bootstrap percentile confidence intervals and nonparametric statistical tests were calculated for statistical inference. Results: Overall agreement between experts in pattern classification was good to excellent with values for κ and Pa of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.94) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96), respectively. Most linear domain indices increased significantly with rising fetal activity whereas the opposite occurred with nonlinear indices, except for SampEn(2, 0.1). LF/(MF + HF) ratio also significantly increased with fetal activity, denoting an increased sympatho-vagal balance. Conclusions: Results support the hypothesis that entropy and linear variability indices measure different FHR features. FHR patterns associated with active sleep (B) and active wakefulness (D) evidenced more signs of autonomous nervous system activity, with sympatho-vagal imbalance, and less signs related to complexity or irregularity control systems than patterns associated with calm sleep (A) and calm wakefulness (C).

AB  - Study objectives: Evaluate the prevalence and phenomenology of dream-associated behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum mothers. Episodes consist of anxious dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion). Design: Three-group design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures. Setting: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by telephone. Participants: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum: n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 ± 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas); pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 ± 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age = 28.5 ± 6.34 years). Interventions: Subjects completed questionnaires about pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares, associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors. Measurements and Results: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%). Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P < 0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%) as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%) (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of dream-associated behaviors. Conclusion: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.

T2  - Infant Mental Health Journal
AB  - The primary goal of this study was to examine sleep problems in a sample of cocaine-exposed 7-month-old infants and to determine if maternal psychopathology mediated any existing association between substance exposure and sleep behaviors. We also examined the differences in sleep behaviors of cocaine-exposed infants in parental custody and cocaine-exposed infants in nonparental custody. Participants were 65 cocaine-exposed and 53 nonexposed infants and their primary caregivers who were recruited at delivery and assessed at 7 months of infant age. As expected, women who used cocaine during pregnancy had more psychiatric symptoms than nonusers. Prenatal exposure to heavier amounts of cocaine was significantly related to more severe sleep difficulties, and maternal anxiety mediated this association. Approximately 28% of cocaine mothers lost custody of their infants by 7 months of age. Nonmaternal caregivers had significantly fewer symptoms of psychopathology than the cocaine-using women who retained custody of their children. Infants who were in nonparental care at 7 months of age also had less severe sleep problems than did infants who remained in parental care.

AB  - The patient was a 15 year-old Caucasian female, 7 weeks pregnant when she presented to our outpatient clinic for increased irritability. Her current stressors were her pregnancy and subsequent termination of her relationship with her 16 year-old boyfriend. The patient had a medical abortion at 9 weeks gestation and was re-assessed 8 weeks after this procedure. Within 1 week of her abortion, she developed progressive hoarding behaviours, involving garbage, water bottles and dirty plates, and was eventually unable to sleep in her bedroom due to the collected items. A trial of fluoxetine was initiated at 10 mg per day in conjunction with cognitive-behavioural therapy. Due to her persistent symptoms, her fluoxetine dose was gradually titrated to 50 mg/day and risperidone 0.5 mg at night was added at week 18 to treat residual OCD symptoms and irritability. Her irritability was not suggestive of akathisia or mania. After 22 weeks of CBT and pharmacotherapy treatment, her CY-BOCS and BDI scores decreased to 16 and 14 respectively. She completed a 14 session course of CBT and was maintained on fluoxetine 60 mg and risperidone 0.5 mg per day. After 12-months of treatment, the patient no longer met the criteria for OCD (CY-BOCS = 0), although she had residual depressive symptoms (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - About what was lost: 20 writers on miscarriage, healing, and hope.
AB  - Elizabeth Oness describes her sense of loss in a series of miscarriages. When our son was two years old, blue-eyed and precocious, strangers started telling me it was time to have another baby. I did want another child, or part of me did, but I was tired, physically and mentally, of juggling household logistics and childcare with my husband. We had just finished our PhDs without putting our son in day care. Motherhood was consuming, but right after my husband landed a tenure-track job in La Crosse, Wisconsin, we decided to have another child. Of course, I weighed it all: another baby, more insanity, more distraction, less sleep. I felt anxious about the idea that a second child would cut further into my writing time, but decided this was the time to do it, since life with a two-year-old was already full of upheaval. I was pregnant twice after Jensen was born, when he was two and a half, and when he turned three. Both times, I passed the "safe" twelve-week mark before losing the pregnancy. When I asked the midwife how long I should wait before getting pregnant again, she told me that I didn't need to wait--after one period I could get pregnant again. Later, searching medical studies on the web, I learned that when a woman gets pregnant within three months of a miscarriage, there's a significantly higher rate of her having another miscarriage or problem pregnancy. I wish someone had told me this. I would have waited, let my body gain a bit more strength--or would I? I didn't question whether it was the right thing to do. Like many women after a miscarriage, I wanted to get pregnant again, right away. And so I did. I lost the third pregnancy at sixteen weeks, a little girl with a profound genetic abnormality. The doctors said it was nothing I'd done. I was older; my eggs were older. It was simply bad luck. Still, I felt that something was terribly wrong--in the cosmic sense--that this should happen again. I consulted an acupuncturist, whose diagnosis didn't contradict what the Western doctors had said. It was simply put in different terms. I'd gotten pregnant when I was exhausted and this was the result. The acupuncturist provided specific directions for preparing for pregnancy again, including Chinese herbal regimens and chi management. I told myself that I could be more brave and optimistic, more spiritually centered with the next baby. But the genetic problems with my last pregnancy frightened me, and my desire to have another child didn't outweigh my fear of calamity. And that was it. I realized that if I couldn't conceive a child while feeling a certain measure of happiness and optimism, it simply wasn't the right thing to do. We are still three. And I have this to report: We are just fine. More than fine, we're happy, when not coping with life's vicissitudes. I don't feel regret about choosing not to get pregnant again. My sisters have had children in the last few years, and my nieces and nephews are adorable, but they don't make me want to roll the dice again.

T2  - The Lancet
AB  - Background: Results of case-control studies in the past 5 years suggest that the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has changed since the 1991 UK Back to Sleep campaign. The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to assess these potential changes. Methods: Population-based data from home visits have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69 explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993 and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen "reference" sleep before interview have been used for comparison. Findings: Over the past 20 years, the proportion of children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone--rather than because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer are breastfed. Interpretation: Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families, and particularly, infant sleep environments.

T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - It is important to consider the potential contribution of seasonality to postpartum depression (PPD; Hiltunen et al, 2004). A possible link between seasonality and PPD may have implications for not only choice of treatment, but also in considering pregnancy planning. The objectives of this pilot study were to examine whether women with seasonal mood changes demonstrated greater incidence of PPD, and to determine if seasonality scores were predictive of PPD. The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ; Rosenthal et al, 1987) was used to assess seasonality of mood. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between clinical factors, SAD diagnosis, SPAQ global seasonality score (GSS) and season of SPAQ administration and PPD. In our sample, twice as many women in the PPD group were found to have SAD compared to the control group. The PPD group also had a higher group GSS mean (10.44) than did the control group (8.84). However, logistic regression analysis showed that higher seasonality scores in women with PPD were not necessarily predictive of PPD. While more women in the PPD group reported increased seasonal weight fluctuation and less sleep in the spring and summer, these items alone did not predict depression after childbirth.

A subsample was seen again at the neonatal stage (n = 152), and their infants were observed for sleep-wake behavior. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to caffeine use. Mothers who consumed more caffeine also smoked more often, were younger, were less educated, reported less sleep effectiveness and more obstetric complications. Their newborns were lower birthweight, they spent less time in REM sleep, and they showed more stress behaviors including hiccups, tremors and jerkiness.

TI  - The effect of co-bedding hospitalized preterm multiple birth infants on selected physiological variables and behavioral cues.
AU  - Orlando, Susan M.
AB  - Reports in the nursing literature suggest there is benefit when hospitalized premature twins share a single crib. Few studies have been done to support this practice yet many nurses implement co-bedding for premature twins. Case study design was used to study the effect of co-bedding hospitalized preterm twins on selected physiologic variables and behavioral cues. Four sets of premature twins born at 32-35 weeks gestation were observed before and during co-bedding. Neonatal physiologic monitors were used to record heart rate, pulse rate, respiration rate, and oxygen saturation levels. Infant behavior was continuously recorded by surveillance cameras. The Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP)reg; method was used to assess physiologic and behavioral signs of stability and stress before and during co-bedding. A significant increase in stability signs during co-bedding was found in half of the cases. Significant decreases in stress were seen more often during co-bedding than were increases in stability signs. The direction of change in the physiologic measures varied between and within the cases. No detrimental physiologic changes were seen in any infant during the co-bedding period. Infants demonstrated increased sleep and greater sleep/wake synchrony during the co-bedding period. A different pattern of physiologic and behavioral responses to co-bedding was seen in each case. Nurses must consider individual infant responses when implementing co-bedding for premature twins.

T2  - Substance Use & Misuse
AB  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health professionals at the Maipú Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption, and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p=0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age (p < 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile, clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Brain Research Reviews
AB  - This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain formation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA), ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA=SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ=NAP have shown neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides.

TI  - Postpartum depression and sleep loss in first time mothers.
AU  - Goyal, Deepika
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe depressive symptoms and sleep in first-time mothers. Predictors of postpartum depressive symptoms, including perceived stress, social support, and maternal adjustment were also examined. Another purpose was to compare objective and subjective sleep in mothers with and without depressive symptoms in the third trimester (Time 1) and at 12 weeks postpartum (Time 2). This descriptive, correlational, longitudinal, secondary analysis utilized data from two randomized clinical trials. Depressive symptoms, psychosocial measures, and subjective and objective sleep measures were collected on a sample of 161 first-time mothers between the ages of 18 and 43 years. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Mean CES-D scores at Time 1 (12.2 + 7.0) significantly improved at Time 2 (8.8 + 6.7). However, of the 46 women scoring in the depressed range at Time 1, 32.6% (n = 15) continued to experience depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Of the 115 women with minimal symptoms at Time 1, 7% (n = 8) experienced depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance were significantly associated at Time 1 and Time 2. Overall sleep disturbance, minutes to fall asleep, ability to stay asleep, and daytime sleepiness significantly improved from late pregnancy to 12 weeks postpartum. Women with depressive symptoms in the late third trimester and 12 weeks postpartum reported significantly more sleep disturbance, trouble falling asleep and more daytime sleepiness than women without depressive symptoms. Fifty-seven percent of the variance in mothers' depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum was explained by six independent variables. However, antenatal CES-D score alone was a significant predictor of postpartum depression scores, accounting for 16.7% of the variance in depression scores at 12 weeks postpartum. The results of this study underscore the need for health care providers to assess depressive symptoms and sleep during pregnancy and during the first few postpartum months. Furthermore, results suggest that complaints of sleep disturbance, especially prolonged sleep onset latency and increased daytime sleepiness, may be relevant screening questions in relation to risk for postpartum depression.

T2  - Infant Mental Health Journal
AB  - This longitudinal, year-long study compared sleep-wake state organization in two groups of infants--infants whose mothers abused substances during their pregnancies and nonexposed, typically developing, age-matched comparison infants--to determine whether differences in sleep-wake state organization existed between the two groups. Seventeen infants of mothers who were participating in a parent-infant residential treatment program for substance abuse were enrolled. Their sleep-wake state organization over the first year of life was compared to that of 17 age-matched comparison infants. The intent was to follow each infant on five occasions over the first year of life using established methods of time-lapse videosomnography to record sleep-wake state organization; however, attrition in the substance-abusing group was problematic. Some sleep-wake variables (i.e., Active Sleep%, Quiet Sleep%, Awake%, number of nighttime awakenings) were similar for both groups of infants at comparable ages across the first year. Total sleep time and the longest sustained sleep period (sleep continuity variables) differed significantly at some of the ages measured. Although overall sleep architecture appears highly resilient and well organized, some indications of sleep fragmentation and shortened nighttime sleep periods were observed in the substance-exposed infants. More research is needed to explain why sleep-continuity variables and not sleep-state proportion variables differed between the two groups.

AB  - Objective: To elucidate the synchronization of phases of diurnal rhythms in fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline between twin fetuses and the occurrence of sustained fetal tachycardia. Methods: FHR was simultaneously recorded in twins for 24 h in 7 monochorionic diamniotic (MD) and 8 dichorionic diamniotic (DD) twin pregnancies at 35 to 38 weeks of gestation. The diurnal rhythms of the hourly mean FHR baseline were tested in each fetus, and the time of occurrence of sustained fetal tachycardia was compared between twins. The correlation coefficients and phase lags of diurnal rhythms between the hourly mean FHR baselines of twins were calculated in each case. Results: There were significant diurnal rhythms in the hourly mean FHR baselines of all twin fetuses (p<0.01). The patterns of diurnal rhythms were similar for each pair of twins, with the exception of the periods of sustained fetal tachycardia. Sustained fetal tachycardia was not coincident between twins. Analysis in which the periods of sustained fetal tachycardia were excluded demonstrated a significant correlation between the hourly mean FHR baselines of twins in all cases (p<0.01). In the case of DD twins, the phase lag between twins was 0; however, phase lags were observed in 4 cases of MD twins. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that the diurnal rhythms in the FHR baseline correlated well between twins, and that the occurrences of sustained fetal tachycardia were completely independent.

AU  - Palacio-Espasa, Francisco

T2  - Innovations in parent-infant psychotherapy.
AB  - Brief parent-infant psychotherapy is a short-term psychotherapeutic intervention method targeting parents with their child. This type of psychotherapeutic intervention was principally created for babies presenting functional symptoms (sleep or food disorders) or behavioral disorders. During research programs on brief mother-infant psychotherapy, the father sometimes wished to participate in the sessions with the mother and infant. Of course, the therapist accepted and thereafter worked with this triad. Thus, the present authors became interested in studying the specific characteristics of these brief psychodynamic psychotherapies carried out with the mother-father-infant triad. They have emphasized that the "third party role" is not exclusively the privilege of the father. Both parents are equally capable of playing this role in relation to the fantasies of exclusive fusion of his/her spouse with the infant. This paper will also emphasize the clinical impression that the father's and mother's fantasy experiences with their infant are quite similar. Both present oedipal and anaclitic fantasies concerning the child that are related to the problems of separation and loss of the object. The narcissistic parental scenario including the infant corresponds to the defense mechanisms erected by the parents to cope with painful feelings stemming from their past experiences of loss. However, the mother maintains closer biological ties with the child, developed during pregnancy, childbirth, and breast-feeding, that augment the intensity of her anaclitic fantasies. A mother-infant relationship of this type would impel the father to experience feelings of exclusion when faced with this "new" couple. At this point, the father more easily falls prey to oedipal fantasies stimulated by this situation in which the mother-infant relationship relegates him to the role of an outsider. The contrast existing between the conviction with which various authors emphasize the father's importance in mother-infant psychotherapies and the difficulty with which these distinctive elements are demonstrated when the father is present during these treatments has led us to a more systematic review of our clinical practice. For this reason, we have concentrated on the clinical and technical aspects of these cases, which were examined in great detail in our research on brief parent-infant psychotherapy treatments in which the father participated. Our theoretical and technical reflections will be represented through several illustrative clinical cases that demonstrate the types of difficulties encountered in these clinical situations.

T2  - Visual Neuroscience
AB  - A model of the development of L/M cone ratios in the Old World primate retina is presented. It is supposed that during gestation, the cone cycles randomly between states in which it transcribes either L or M opsin. The current state determines and increases the probability that it will transcribe the same opsin in future cycles. These assumptions are sufficient to formalize the process as a Markov chain that can be modeled as an urn containing two types of balls, L and M. Drawing one ball results in the increase of its species and the decrease of the other. Over the long run, the urn will become populated with a single type of ball. This state corresponds to the photoreceptor adopting a fixed identity for its lifetime. We investigate the effect of the number of states and the rule that regulates the advantage of transition toward one cone type or another on the relation between fetal and adult L/M cone ratios. In the range of 100 to 1000 states, small variations of the initial L/M ratio or the transition advantage can each generate large changes in the final L/M ratio, in qualitative accord with the variation seen in human adult retinas. The time course to attain stable L/M ratios also varies with these parameters. If it is believed that the cycling follows a circadian rhythm, then final L/M cone ratios would be expected to stabilize shortly after birth in the human being and the macaque.

AU  - Makhoul, Imad R.

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Background: Emerging evidence on faster growth in preterm infants with higher heart rate as opposed to the classical approach calls for further research. Aims: to test whether (1) high or low heart rate and (2) heart rate during the first days of life predict greater weight gain in preterm infants. Methods: A retrospective study analyzing two daily measures of heart rate obtained during restful sleep, total daily calorie intake and daily weight gain measured always in the morning before meal were collected from the medical files. Results: Analysis of 90 healthy preterm infants born at 32-36 weeks of gestation revealed that increased mean heart rate during hospitalization predicted greater weight gain even when controlling for calorie intake, birth weight, gestational age, appropriateness of birth weight for gestational age, and length of hospitalization. Mean heart rate during the first three days of life yielded the same pattern of results. Post-hoc analysis of variance between infants with mean daily heart rate ≤ 139 bpm vs. ≥ 140 bpm showed that infants with higher heart rate achieved a significantly higher weight gain. Conclusions: It is suggested that, contrary to adults, in neonates an anabolic activity is represented by increased sympathetic functioning within the normal range. The implications of a slower growth rate for additional developmental care and individual considerations of appropriate stimulation in preterm infants are discussed.

TI  - Evolving applications of light therapy.
AU  - Terman, Michael
T2  - Sleep Medicine Reviews
AB  - The psychiatric intervention, light therapy, grew from an intensive 25-year research focus on seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Dosing and timing strategies have been honed to optimize the antidepressant effect, and efficacy relative to placebo has provided the evidence base for widespread implementation. A persistent question has been whether the model system for SAD has wider utility for psychiatric disturbance, even beyond depression. The circadian phase-shifting capacity of timed light exposure is universal, and chronobiological factors are at play across the disease spectrum. Recent promising initiatives extend to light treatment for nonseasonal major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, including drug and electroconvulsive therapy-resistant cases. With light therapy, patients with antepartum depression may find an alternative to medication during pregnancy. Cognitive improvement under light therapy has been noted in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor function in Parkinson's disease has improved in parallel with the antidepressant effect of light therapy. The rest-activity disturbance of elderly dementia has been partially allayed under light therapy. In a new initiative, three major chronotherapeutic inventions--light therapy, sleep deprivation (wake therapy) and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being combined to snap hospitalized patients out of deep depression and maintain longterm improvement.

T2  - Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research
AB  - Study Objectives: To evaluate sleep practices regarding maternal, infant, and socioeconomic factors in an infant population and to propose a scoring scale associated with high versus low risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Design: Cross-sectional, population-based study. Setting: Passo Fundo, Brazil. Participants: 2,285 newborns. Interventions: Perinatal information was collected from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed. Measurements and Results: Application of the score allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age ≤ 20 years (p < .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p < .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices. Conclusions: High-risk sleep practices were widely observed in the study population. The significance of this study lies in the future application of this information via public health measures targeted at high-risk populations.

TI  - Order and disorder in the brain function.
AU  - Quadens, Olga
T2  - Activitas Nervosa Superior
AB  - The interest in studying the brain electrical activity as a function of the development of intelligence has been spurred by the need to understand how the brain responds to environmental information. The description of sleep in mentally retarded children reveals deviant patterns of the EEG-spindles and of the eye movement activity (REM sleep) when compared to normal children. The patterns may be considered as a valuable index of mental function. According to experimental evidence, the distribution of the eye movements of sleep appears either as random or ordered. The latter are altered in the mentally handicapped in whom the appearance out of chaos, of the order which is needed for intelligence and memory to function, is altered. The sleep signs are redundant as from birth. Their pattern is also related to the psychomotor development of the infant. If their distribution remains random, or appears in long uninterrupted sequences of waves as in epilepsy, intelligence does not develop. A similar strategy appears to function in the foetus when nature organizes the structures that will lead to the development of intelligence. The eye movement patterns of sleep change in the pregnant women as a function of term and resemble those of premature babies of a similar gestational age. They also change as a function of the menstrual cycle and more generally as a function of age. The hypothesis that attention is the diurnal equivalent of REM sleep is discussed. Attempts at modelling the eye movement patterns of REM sleep as a function of near zero gravity environments have been made. 1) By means of a Montecarlo simulation using the semi Markov model during the Spacelab 1 flight. 2) With the method of the single and multiple g-phase transition analysis of the strange attractor dimension (d) during parabolic flights. The implication of the latter for the neural processes involved in learning is that the central nervous system can preserve intact, from input to output, over a period of several days, all the information it receives 3) The relation between spindles and eye movements has also been viewed by a quantum approach which is another medium between the information and the way of describing it.

AU  - Jomeen, Julie

T2  - Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology
AB  - Sleep quality is integral to optimal physical functioning and mental health during pregnancy. There has, however, been little work conducted to determine the most appropriate measure of sleep quality in this clinical group, a surprising observation given the complex and dynamic psychobiology of pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated to determine the usefulness of this measure in early pregnancy. The psychometric properties of the PSQI were evaluated in women at 14 weeks of pregnancy and revealed the instrument to have good internal consistency and convergent and divergent reliability properties. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the removal of the PSQI sleeping medications sub-scale from the global sleep quality total score calculation would improve the utility of this measure in early pregnancy. Women classified as depressed on the basis of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were found to have significantly poorer sleep quality scores on the majority of PSQI sub-scales. The relationship between sleep quality and depression was found to be statistically significant and clinically relevant during early pregnancy and the PSQI would appear to be an appropriate measure to assess sleep quality in this group.

AU  - Williams, Maynard M.
T2  - Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry
AB  - Objective: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for postnatal depressive symptoms in a cohort of mothers of Pacific Island infants in Auckland, New Zealand. Method: The data were gathered as part of the Pacific Island Families Study, in which 1376 mothers were interviewed when their babies were 6 weeks old. The interview included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: 16.4% of mothers were assessed as probably experiencing depression. Prevalence rates varied from 7.6% for Samoans to 30.9% for Tongans. In addition to ethnicity, risk factors identified by stepwise multiple logistic regression included low Pacific Island acculturation, first birth, stress due to insufficient food, household income less than $40,000, difficulty with transport, dissatisfaction with pregnancy, birth experience, baby's sleep patterns, partner relationship and home. A large prevalence difference between Tongans and other groups remained when the effects of other risk factors were controlled statistically. Conclusions: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among Pacific mothers is at the upper end of the range typically reported. Focus on the overall rate, however, obscures substantial variation between groups. Risk factors are generally similar to those identified in previous research. Implications: The findings have implications for prevention and treatment and caution against assuming homogeneity within ethnic categories. Further research is required to explain differences in prevalence between Tongan and other Pacific Island groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Independently, prenatal malnutrition and psychological/physical stress have been shown to affect sleep architecture in adult rats. As malnutrition and stress commonly co-exist in malnourished human populations, the objective of the present study was to ascertain the combined effects of these two insults by examining sleep-wake parameters following a brief restraint stress in prenatally protein malnourished rats. The male offspring of rats provided with a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were implanted with recording electrodes beginning at postnatal day 90. Polygraph recordings were obtained to quantify sleep states during the first 4 h of the dark phase of the cycle on 2 consecutive days. The first followed a 24-h habituation session to the recording chamber (baseline). The second occurred at the same time of day but followed 20 min of restraint stress in a Plexiglas tube. During baseline, prenatally malnourished rats spent more time in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in the first 2 h after "lights off" (block 1), and greater amounts of wakefulness (W) with a corresponding reduction in slow wave sleep (SWS) in the second two hours (block 2), as compared with controls. Following stress, the sleep architecture of both groups of rats remained unaltered in block 1 relative to their baseline day. In block 2, both groups exhibited significant reductions in SWS and REMS with significantly greater reductions being expressed in the prenatally malnourished group (most dramatically, REMS was completely eliminated). These findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be more severe in those malnourished human populations subjected to acutely stressful experiences.

AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the factors associated with their smoking behavior. Method: Five hundred institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these institutions, 260 participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2002. Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior. Results: Data were obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% CI 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep duration and in women who drank. Conclusion: Smoking among pregnant women remains an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote antismoking measures based on the results of this study.

AB  - The current study investigated the attentional mechanisms associated with goal engagement and disengagement in a lifespan context. Women approaching the end of their childbearing years (N = 29) were compared with women who had passed that deadline (N = 28). Participants' goal engagement was measured with a goal nomination task, an incidental recall task of goal-relevant sentences, visual attention to goal-relevant vs. goal-irrelevant images, and a memory task of goal-relevant images. The attention data indicated that women approaching the deadline had a longer first fixation on baby images than women who had passed the deadline. This novel finding was supported by a replication of the previous finding that women approaching the deadline were more engaged with the goal of childbearing than women who had passed the deadline. The connection between attention and memory of goal-relevant information is explored as evidence of cognition working in the service of motivation and developmental regulation.

AU  - Friese, Carrie
AU  - Becker, Gay
AU  - Nachtigall, Robert D.
T2  - Social Science & Medicine
AB  - Over the past generation, aging and female reproduction have been lodged within the gendered and gendering debates regarding women's involvement in the workforce and demographic shifts toward delayed parenting that culminate in discourses on the "biological clock". Technological solutions to the biological clock, specifically in vitro fertilization, have led to clinical attempts to assess "ovarian reserve", or qualitative and quantitative changes in the ovary that correlate with aging and with successful infertility treatment. Rupturing the longstanding historical connections between menstruation and female reproductive capacity by specifically focusing on the aging of a woman's eggs, the clinical designation of "diminished ovarian reserve" has come to imply that a woman has "old eggs". This is associated in practitioners' and patients' minds with the eclipse of a woman's reproductive potential and with hidden harbingers of menopause. In an ethnographic interview study of 79 couples in the US who conceived after using donor oocytes, we found that women voiced two different narratives that described their experience and attitudes when confronted with an apparent age-related decline in their fertility. The "eleventh-hour mom" narrative was voiced by women who initially tried to become pregnant with their own eggs and turned to donated oocytes as a second-choice option, whereas the "miracle mom" narrative was expressed by women who were generally older, some of whom had entered infertility treatment hoping to conceive with their own eggs, but some who knew from the outset that it was not going to be possible. Through their narratives women not only embodied and made meaningful "diminished ovarian reserve" in varying ways that connect with cultural, social, structural/organizational, symbolic and physical aspects of aging, they reproduced the socio-biological project of the biological clock, but rooted this social project in the metaphor of "old eggs" rather than menopause.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin. Methods: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Results: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance. Conclusion: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

Methods: The study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5–27.1 years). The principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic snoring. Results: The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education, height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing. Conclusions: Premature infants with very low birth weight have a twofold risk of sleep-disordered breathing as young adults. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of sleep-disordered breathing by more than twofold. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Experimental animal data link prenatal stress with sleep disturbance in offspring, but the link in humans is unclear. Aims: To investigate the link between prenatal maternal anxiety and depression and infant sleep disturbance from 6 to 30 months of age. Study Design: Longitudinal prospective study of a large birth cohort from pregnancy to 30 months. Questionnaire measures of anxiety and depression were completed by mothers at 18 and 32 weeks gestation and at 8 weeks and 8 months postpartum. Subjects: The ALSPAC cohort, a prospective community study of women in the UK who have been followed since pregnancy. Outcome Measures: Measures of total sleep time, number of awakenings, and broadly defined sleep problems were available on children at ages 6, 18, and 30 months. Results: Reliable measures of total sleep time, nighttime awakenings, and sleep problems were identified at 6, 18, and 30 months. Higher levels of prenatal maternal anxiety and depression predicted more sleep problems at 18 and 30 months, after controlling for postnatal mood and obstetric and psychosocial covariates; the association was not restricted to clinical extremes. No link with total sleep time was observed. Conclusions: Mood disturbance in pregnancy has persisting effects on sleep problems in the child, a finding that is consistent with experimental animal research. The findings add to a growing literature showing that maternal prenatal stress, anxiety, and depression may have lasting effects on child development.

AB  - Health and well-being, as well as physical and cognitive functioning, can be severely compromised by poor sleep and chronic sleep loss. Most women’s sleep loss is attributable to lifestyle factors such as staying up late to complete household responsibilities, caring for young or elderly family members, or working long hours or at night in healthcare or transportation industries. At other times, women’s sleep can be disturbed by an acute or chronic illness. Although a single pregnancy and postpartum period spans only about 2 years in a woman’s entire life, sleep disturbance during this reproductive phase can have a major effect on the health of the mother as well as her infant. Beginning early in pregnancy, sleep can be disrupted by urinary frequency, nausea, leg cramps, and other discomforts. Insufficient sleep during the third trimester may place women at higher risk for longer labors and cesarean births. This special perinatal section primarily focuses on maternal sleep experiences prior to delivery and sleep loss associated with postpartum recovery and maternal mental health. It is hoped that the studies enclosed in the perinatal section of this special issue spotlight the essential sleep needs of new mothers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sleep disturbance is a typical complaint during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies of this phenomenon have not measured sleep in the last days of pregnancy as women transition into labor. Poor sleep can have potentially adverse effects on labor and delivery. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of sleep obtained in the 5 days preceding childbirth, and the relationship between sleep in this time frame and both pain and fatigue during early labor. Methods: Thirty-five nulliparous women were recruited from childbirth preparation classes. Sleep was measured with wrist actigraphy continuously until hospital admission for delivery. Participants completed self-report measures of pain and fatigue in early labor prior to hospital admission. Result and Discussion: Most women experienced spontaneous labor onset during the night. Sleep quality deteriorated progressively over the last 5 days of pregnancy, and was the lowest on the night before hospital admission. This was the case even when labor was induced (40%). Conclusion: There was a significant relationship between the amount of sleep the night before hospitalization and pain perception in women with spontaneous labor onset. Results from this study can be used to advise women in late pregnancy about expected sleep patterns and measures to optimize sleep and rest.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn from 20 mothers about their experience of sleep during pregnancy and the immediate months of becoming a new mother. The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. Methods: Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. Results and Conclusions: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps, development of a “sleep consciousness,” and bed-sharing. Mercer’s stages of becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes into their lives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: This study describes the patterns of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms in a sample of childbearing women from the third trimester through the postpartum period. The relationship between sleep and depressive symptoms is also examined. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of sleep and depressive symptoms between women with depressive symptoms in comparison with women with minimal or no depressive symptoms in the third trimester and in the third month postpartum. Methods: This longitudinal, descriptive study followed 124 primiparous women from their last month of pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. Questionnaires on sleep and depressive symptoms were completed during the third trimester (Time 1), 1 month postpartum (Time 2), 2 months postpartum (Time 3), and during the third month postpartum (Time 4). Sleep measures in a subset of women with depressive symptoms were compared with those of women with minimal or no symptoms at Time 1 and Time 4. Results and Conclusions: Sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were associated at Time 1 and Time 4. For new mothers, a complaint of trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep onset latency) may be the most relevant screening question in relation to their risk for postpartum depression.

AB  - Study Objective: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by passive smoking. In this study we investigated the effects of passive smoking on sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Design: Two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys conducted in 2002 and 2006. Setting: Clinical institutions specializing in obstetrics and gynecology that participated in the nationwide surveys: 260 in the 2002 survey and 344 in the 2006 survey. Participants: 16,396 and 19,386 pregnant women in Japan surveyed in 2002 and 2006, respectively. Intervention: N/A. Measurements and Results: Pregnant women exposed to passive smoking were likely to have sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably. Smoking pregnant women had the same sleep disturbances and also experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and early morning awakening. The prevalence of 5 types of sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably) among nonsmokers with environmental tobacco smoke showed a mean value intermediate between that of active smokers and that of nonsmokers without environmental tobacco smoke. Conclusion: Passive smoking is independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The objectives of this study were a) to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among women with postpartum depression, b) examine the association between severity of depressive symptoms and level of impairment in physical and mental HRQoL and c) to identify contributors to physical and mental HRQoL. Seventy-eight women scoring ≥10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale completed the questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form SF-36), sleep quality, life stress, and social support. All women underwent a cardiovascular stress test to determine aerobic capacity. Compared to Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored significantly lower on all SF-36 domains, as well as on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean delivery, poorer sleep quality, life stress, and less social support predicted poorer mental health status.

AU  - Pinder, Roger M.
T2  - Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment
AB  - Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the limbs accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, leading to disturbed sleep and a poor quality of life. Symptoms usually begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, and are partly or completely relieved by active movement. Symptoms tend to worsen in the evening and at night. RLS is a chronic neurological condition that occurs in two forms, a primary disorder independent of other disorders, and a form that is secondary to other conditions such as pregnancy, iron deficiency, and end-stage renal disease. RLS affects about 5%-10% of the general adult population, but the risk increases in the elderly and in women. It can also affect children and adolescents, and is more common in children with ADHD. In this issue of Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment the biopsychosocial aspects of RLS and particularly mental health problems like disturbances of mood and cognition are reviewed.

AB  - Retrospective (questionnaire) and prospective (5-day diary) self-reports of sleep were obtained from 209 women during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. On average, the women slept for 465 min, took around 20 min to get to sleep, and were awake for just over 30 min after initial sleep onset having woke 2.6 times on average. Sleep efficiency was around 89%. Significant differences were found between retrospective and prospective reports only on the number of minutes awake after sleep onset and on sleep efficiency. However, these differences were small. Retrospective and prospective reports were only moderately correlated. These results were not markedly different from values reported in much smaller, previous studies of pregnant women using polysomnography, suggesting that the self-reports were valid. The findings suggest that sleep parameters are not as adversely affected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy as is generally believed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Pregnant women have been prescribed bed rest for a variety of reasons: preterm labor, incompetent cervix, high-blood pressure, multiple gestation, placenta previa, and many other patient-specific complications. However, while the prescription of bed rest has become routine, the effectiveness of this potentially harmful treatment is still controversial. Pregnant women that are confined to bed rest are at an increased risk for physical, emotional and economic hardships. By understanding these effects, utilizing appropriate interventions and educating this at-risk population on coping strategies, we as health care providers, can improve the quality of care we give our patients during this life-changing event.

Results: The prevalence of RLS in pregnant women in the outpatient department was 12.4% (14/113), the percentage of RLS pregnant women with PSQI total score higher than 7 was 28.6%, and that was 10.1% in the pregnant women without RLS (χ² = 3.86, P < 0.05). Other factors such as age, annual income were not related to RLS. Conclusions: The sleep quality of pregnant women with RLS is poor, and the age, annual income have no relation to the incidence of RLS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

Many women attribute sleep difficulties to abortion, but this self-diagnosis has not been tested using record-based evidence. Examination of records for 56,824 women with no known history of sleep disorders or sleep disturbances revealed that women were more likely to be treated for sleep disorders or disturbances following an induced abortion compared to a birth.

Tea was born during the sixth month of pregnancy after an induced labour. She weighed 600 grams because the placenta was not feeding her. She spent many months in an incubator fighting serious infections which often brought her dangerously close to death. From an organic point of view, she is a healthy child with a lively intelligence and an extremely rich, expressive and appropriate vocabulary. The work discusses some methods of interpretation and their result in the work of smoothing down the little girl's defences: on recommencing after the summer break, she is tending to exercise an inflexible control over the analyst, designed to avoid contact with feelings of fragility, impotence and need which are intolerable for her at the moment.

AB  - We report the case of a 32-year-old woman hospitalized for a brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset. Gestation proceeded without major problems, delivery occurred at term uneventfully. Breastfeeding was initiated after birth. At day 9 postpartum, the mother presented auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusional ideas. Her behavior was grossly disorganized and her speech incoherent. She was hospitalized with her infant. At admission, she received haloperidol 5 mg and levopromazine 25 mg IM. Olanzapine 20 mg/d was prescribed the same day, levopromazine was required to control anxiety and sleep troubles. On the mother's request and after informed consent, nursing was discontinued the day of admission. Olanzapine was administrated each day at 5:30 PM. Breast milk spontaneously produced was collected by an electric pump twice a day, homogenized, and 7 mL aliquots were kept for analysis. In this case report, olanzapine appears to be excreted into breast milk in relatively small amounts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The influence of psychological forces on childbearing delay in women nearing the end of fecundity.
AU  - Slosar, Heather Kelly
AB  - This research examined the subjective experiences of eight childless women nearing the end of fecundity who had delayed childbearing without consciously choosing to do so. A primary goal was to understand the role that conscious and unconscious psychological forces played in these women's reproductive lives and decisions. Conscious and unconscious conflict toward motherhood and pregnancy were explored via semi-structured interviews and projective cards from the TAT and Pregnancy TAT (Murray, 1943; Knobel & Vigneau, 1967). The author does not take a pronatalist position. Rather, the assumption is that unconscious or unwitting avoidance and postponement of decisions about reproductive choices is an undesirable outcome, one that may lead to strong disappointment and regret once the biological clock runs out. Results yielded a list of common factors that appear to have contributed to reproductive delay. All participants consciously stated a desire to have children, and expressed the feeling that forces out of their control have led to their delay. All participants appeared to externalize the reasons for their delay to the men they have dated or married. The most noteworthy finding was the influence of childhood object relations on childbearing conflict. Specifically, a striking lack of parental nurturance, love, and affection was reported by all subjects. Other findings common among the majority of participants included: a history of significant childhood trauma or loss that was never discussed; disavowal of maternal identification; avoidance of responsibility as adults; pregnancy fears including body image concerns with pregnancy; anger at parents due to childhood treatment; use of defense mechanisms such as repression, denial, and intellectualization to protect against reality that childbearing may not be possible; mis-information about fertility including a belief that women can easily conceive children into their late forties and beyond, being youngest child in family of origin; older childless siblings; and a lack of parental encouragement to have children. While these common factors may ultimately have value in identifying women who are at risk for unwitting or unconsciously delayed childbearing which later results in profound disappointment, future research is needed to clarify and generalize these findings.

AB  - The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to compare psychological distress as measured via self-reported perceived stress, sleep, and fatigue levels in lactating mothers of a term infant and mothers of a preterm infant and (b) to determine whether the addition of psychological distress to a previous model predicts milk volume at Postpartum Week 6 by gestation group. The convenience sample of 95 mothers of a preterm infant ( ≤31 weeks) and 98 mothers of a term infant completed the Perceived Stress Visual Analogue Scale, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, and the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale. Stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue levels decreased during the 6-week study period for mothers of a term but not for mothers of a preterm infant. Perceived stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue during the first 6 weeks postpartum were not related to milk volume; thus, the mother's perceived psychological distress had no apparent effect on lactation.

AB  - A huge amount of knowledge about sleep has accumulated during the last 5 decades following the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nevertheless, there are numerous areas of considerable ignorance. One of these concerns the particularities of sleep in women. Most basic and clinical studies have been performed in male subjects, and only very recently research groups around the world have addressed women's sleep in health and disease. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge on the influence of oestrogens on the brain and on the distinctive changes of sleep across the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy and menopause. In addition, studies in female rodents are reviewed as well as the knowledge on female peculiarities regarding the interactions between sleep regulation and age-related changes in circadian rhythms. We also address specific aspects of sleep loss and sleep disorders in women. Finally, very recent studies on the sociology of sleep are summarized and future directions in the field are discussed.

AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maternal smoking, sleeping position, sleep state and postnatal age on heart rate changes following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation in infants. Subjects: We studied healthy term infants, 13 of whom were born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. Each infant was studied using daytime polysomnography on 3 occasions: (a) 2-3 weeks, (b) 2-3 months and (c) 5-6 months after birth. Nasal air-jet stimulation was presented in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. Results: We found no difference between infants of smoking and non-smoking mothers in any of the parameters measured. Minimum HR (MinHR) following nonarousing trigeminal stimulation was significantly lower in the supine compared to the prone sleeping position at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months of age (p<0.05) in AS, and at all 3 ages in QS (p<0.01). MinHR was significantly lower in QS compared to AS at 2-3 months when infants slept prone and at 5-6 months when sleeping supine (p<0.01). In QS, MinHR became lower with increasing postnatal age in both sleep positions (p<0.01). In AS, there was no maturational effect. The normalized bradycardia (AHR%) was significantly greater in AS than in QS at 2-3 weeks of age (p<0.05) when infants slept supine. Conclusion: Our study has shown that there was a decrease in heart rate (MinHR) following trigeminal stimulation in infants up to 6 months of age and this was affected by sleep position and sleep state, being larger in the supine sleeping position and the QS state.

TI  - Mother-Infant Bedsharing is Associated with an Increase in Infant Heart Rate.
AU  - Richard, Christopher A.

T2  - Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research
AB  - Objectives: We hypothesized that mother-infant bed sharing, compared to solitary sleeping, would be associated with higher infant heart rates. The objective was to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported, differences in the same infants. Design: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a room alone. Setting: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine Medical Center. Participants: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the study. Interventions: None. Results: Analysis of variance indicated that, irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate. Conclusions: Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.

AB  - Dopaminergic agents, particularly dopamine agonists, have been used with increasing frequency in the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder. These evidence-based practice parameters are complementary to the Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, published in 1999.1 These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of dopaminergic agents in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Levodopa with decarboxylase inhibitor, and the dopaminergic agonists pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Other dopamine agonists (talipexole, cabergoline, piribidel, and alpha-dihydroergocryptine) and the dopaminergic agents amantadine and selegiline may be effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD, but the level of effectiveness of these medications is not currently established. Lastly, no specific recommendations can be made regarding dopaminergic treatment of children or pregnant women with RLS or PLMD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Objective: In a large unselected population of normal spontaneous pregnancies, to estimate the biologic variation of the interval from the first day of the last menstrual period to start of pregnancy, and the biologic variation of gestational length to delivery; and to estimate the random error of routine ultrasound assessment of gestational age in mid-second trimester. Study design: Cohort study of 11,238 singleton pregnancies, with spontaneous onset of labour and reliable last menstrual period. The day of delivery was predicted with two independent methods: According to the rule of Nagele and based on ultrasound examination in gestational weeks 17-19. For both methods, the mean difference between observed and predicted day of delivery was calculated. The variances of the differences were combined to estimate the variances of the two partitions of pregnancy. Results: The biologic variation of the time from last menstrual period to pregnancy start was estimated to 7.0 days (standard deviation), and the standard deviation of the time to spontaneous delivery was estimated to 12.4 days. The estimate of the standard deviation of the random error of ultrasound assessed foetal age was 5.2 days. Conclusion: Even when the last menstrual period is reliable, the biologic variation of the time from last menstrual period to the real start of pregnancy is substantial, and must be taken into account. Reliable information about the first day of the last menstrual period is not equivalent with reliable information about the start of pregnancy.

AB  - The study estimates the unpredictable disorder (chaos) within the 24 h pattern of sinus R-R intervals (SRRI) in clinically healthy pregnant women (CHPW) and clinically healthy non-pregnant women (CHNPW), in order to evaluate the early gestational changes in neurovegetative cardiac pacing. SRRI were provided by the 24-h Holter ECG of 10 CHPW and 10 CHNPW. SRRI were investigated by descriptive conventional statistics by means of the Time and Frequency Domain Analysis, and subsequently, in their chaotic component by means of entropy analysis. Both the SRRI and entropy were tested via the Cosinor method to better decipher whether or not the periodic disorder in heart rate variability is modified in pregnancy as a result of a gestational tonic resetting of the cardiac sympatho-vagal regulation. Cosinor analysis documented that the circadian rhythm of both the SRRI and entropy were preserved in CHNPW and CHPW. However, the circadian rhythm of SRRI and entropy in CHPW exhibited a significantly decreased 24 h mean. Via the analysis of the rhythmicity of entropy, this study has documented that the chaos in the 24 h pattern of SRRI is less prominent in CHPW than in CHNPW. Such a reduction of level in the deterministic periodic chaos of heart rate variability provides evidence that, in early pregnancy, a tonic elevation of the sympathetic activity regulates cardiac pacing.

T2  - Infant Behavior & Development
AB  - Eighty pregnant women were assessed for depression during mid-pregnancy (Mean gestational age = 25.9 weeks) and shortly after delivery in order to assess the effects of the onset and chronicity of maternal depression on neonatal behavior. The women were classified as reporting depressive symptoms: (1) only during the prepartum assessment; (2) only during the postpartum assessment; (3) during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments; or (4) reporting no depressive symptoms at either the prepartum or the postpartum assessment. Neonates born to mothers reporting symptoms of depression at any time point exhibited greater indeterminate sleep than neonates of non-depressed mothers. Neonates born to mothers reporting prenatal depression spent more time fussing and crying and exhibited more stress behaviors than neonates born to non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression only during the postpartum assessment. Finally, neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments exhibited less optimal Brazelton neurobehavioral assessment scores than neonates of non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers who exhibited symptoms of depression during only the prepartum or only during the postpartum assessments. Taken together these findings suggest that neonatal behavior is influenced not just by the presence but also by the timing and duration of maternal depression symptoms.

T2  - Infant Behavior & Development
AB  - Evaluation of risk factors and short-term outcomes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are essential to identify infants in need of developmental intervention after discharge. This study examined risk factors with the potential to affect short-term neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes in preterm infants born at <31 weeks gestation. Data were obtained in a larger longitudinal randomized study of the effects of cycled light and continuous near darkness on health. Severity of neurological insults and caffeine use predicted poorer neurobehavioral outcomes; and severity of neurological insults, caffeine use, length of hospitalization and ventilator days were associated with altered sleep-wake state organization. There were no significant effects of environmental lighting on the short-term developmental outcomes of preterm infants. Early knowledge of an infant's neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes can provide families and health care providers with important information to target the utilization of early intervention services.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe factors associated with actigraphic and subjective sleep quality in young women. Methods: Participants were 73 regularly menstruating women, 20-40 years old, who were not taking oral contraceptives, pregnant, or shift workers. Women contributed an average of 7 nights of actigraphy data during the luteal menstrual cycle phase, resulting in a total of 595 nights of data. Results: One night of actigraphy data was unreliable for measuring total sleep time, sleep onset, and time in bed (intraclass correlation ≤.15) but was acceptable for measuring sleep efficiency and total wake time (intraclass correlation [ICC]=.52). Going to bed late, medication use, employment, increased daylight hours, longer menstrual cycle length, and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with poorer actigraphic sleep measures. Employment, age, and perceived stress were associated with subjective sleep quality. Conclusion: Multiple factors were associated with sleep quality in these young women who were sleeping at home. However, the associations differed for subjectively versus actigraphically assessed sleep quality. Actigraphy is feasible for measuring sleep, but multiple recording nights may be needed to obtain reliable estimates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Sleep patterns of women at risk for the development of preterm labor.
AU  - Strange, Laura Blankenship
AB  - Prematurity, delivery prior to 37 weeks gestation, is the primary cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Extensive research on its prevention and management reveals that corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and cytokines play significant roles in the development of preterm labor. These substances also influence sleep, suggesting a possible, but previously unexplored, association between sleep pattern changes and preterm labor. Thus, in order to begin a systematic examination of this potentially important relationship, this study explored subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. The Bi-Dimensional Stress Model, which describes the influence of physiological and psychosocial stress in stimulating the immune and endocrine responses associated with preterm birth, provided the theoretical framework for this study. The design consisted of a convenience sample of 220 subjects participating in a descriptive, prospective, comparative study. Subjects completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during routine antenatal visits in the second trimester of pregnancy. Delivery outcome data identified those subjects who delivered preterm. Sleep latency, a component of the PSQI and a measure of the period from "lights out" to sleep onset, was longer in those who delivered preterm compared to those who delivered at term. The daytime dysfunction score, a component of the PSQI and a measure of problems with maintenance of alertness, was higher in those who experienced a term delivery. No differences were detected between the preterm and term groups in the total scores of the other primary variables (PSQI, ESS, and PSS), in the other sleep variables measured by the PSQI (sleep efficiency, total sleep time), or in the other component scores of the PSQI. The preterm group reported more cigarette smoking, previous preterm births, and experienced more twin gestations than the term group. However, only previous preterm birth and sleep latency were predictive of preterm birth. This study represents the first investigation to explore the potential relationship between sleep and preterm labor. Outcomes from this research suggest a possible, relationship between sleep onset insomnia and preterm birth. In addition, recommendations for further research are identified.

AB  - This study examined the association between maternal smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during pregnancy and infant heart rate. Participants were 62 mother-infant dyads where mother smoked during pregnancy, 47 dyads where mother did not smoke during pregnancy but was exposed to ETS and 47 dyads where mother did not smoke and was not exposed to ETS. Average heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were assessed at 2-4 weeks of age during sleep. Infants in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than nonexposed infants. Furthermore, boys in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than girls. These results highlight the importance of considering prenatal ETS exposure and infant gender when assessing infant outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research
AB  - Study Objective: Changes in sleep-disordered breathing associated with late pregnancy have not previously been systematically investigated; however, a number of case reports indicate exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea in late pregnancy, often in association with maternal hypertension. We aimed to compare the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated maternal blood-pressure responses in late pregnancy with the nonpregnant state. Design: Case-controlled, longitudinal study of sleep-disordered breathing during late pregnancy and postpartum. Study Patients: Ten women referred for suspected sleep-disordered breathing during the third trimester of pregnancy. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Full overnight polysomnography and continuous systemic blood pressure were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and 3 months following delivery. Parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, including apnea hypopnea index and minimum overnight arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, were compared between antenatal and postnatal studies. An improvement in both apnea-hypopnea index and minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation occurred consistently in all subjects postnatally. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, mean apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 63 ± 15 per hour antenatally to 18 ± 4 per hour postnatally (P = .03), and in rapid eye movement sleep, from 64 ± 11 per hour to 22 ± 4 per hour (P = .002). Minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was increased from 86% ± 2% antenatally to 91% ± 1% postnatally (P = .01). Arterial blood-pressure responses to apnea peaked at 170 to 180 mm Hg antenatally, while they only peaked at 130 to 140 mm Hg postnatally. Conclusion: This study indicates that late pregnancy may be associated with increased severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated blood-pressure responses.

AU  - Hermida, Ramón C.

T2  - Chronobiology International
AB  - Studies based on conventional office blood pressure (BP) measurements concluded that both maternal age and parity have significant effects on BP during pregnancy. Previous results have also indicated predictable trends of BP variability with gestational age. Accordingly, we have evaluated possible differences in the circadian pattern of ambulatory BP as a function of parity, maternal age, and stage of gestation in normotensive women who were systematically studied by ambulatory BP monitoring during their pregnancies. We analyzed 1408 BP profiles obtained from 126 nulliparous and 109 multiparous pregnant women sampled for 48 consecutive h every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (usually within the first trimester of pregnancy) until delivery. Data were divided for comparative analysis according to parity (nulliparous versus multiparous), age (≤25, 26-30, 31-35, and ≥36 yrs), and trimester of gestation. Circadian BP parameters established by population multiple-components analysis were compared between groups using a nonparametric test. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern described by a model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12h is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic BP for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (always p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the 24h mean among groups divided by parity at any age or stage of pregnancy. A trend of increasing BP with age was found for diastolic but not for systolic BP. Although statistically significant, differences in the 24h mean of diastolic BP among groups divided by age were always less than 2 mm Hg. Data obtained from systematic ambulatory monitoring in normotensive pregnant women indicate the lack of differences in BP according to parity. The small, although significant, increase in diastolic BP with age may have scarce influence in the proper identification of women with gestational hypertension. Reference thresholds for BP to be used in the early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy could thus be developed as a function of the rest-activity cycle and gestational age only, and independently of parity or maternal age.

AB  - The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness. An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated. The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past. Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

AB  - Supplementation during pregnancy forms a vital part of the well-being and development of the unborn child as well as the mother. Very often different brands of over-the-counter vitamins and minerals are taken, without considering the possibility of exceeding the maximum daily allowance, particularly where it concerns fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A. Although many people are aware of the consequences of taking too little vitamin A, this fat-soluble vitamin is stored in the body and over-dosage may occur when taking high doses. In this paper we investigate the effects of hypo- and hypervitaminosis A on craniofacial structures, lungs, hearts, limbs and the kidneys as well as the involvement in foetal nervous system development and post-natal sensorimotor functioning. Furthermore, we discuss how hypo- and hypervitaminosis A may affect the midline and lateral parts of the cerebellum, vermis, flocculi, ganglionic cell layer as well as the suprachiasmatic nucleas of the brain. Changes in the functioning of these areas due to hypo- and hypervitaminosis A, may lead to developmental and learning disabilities involving all forms of motor learning, vestibular functioning, eye and visual system deficits, disrupted sleep rhythms as well as altered mood and emotional processes.

T2  - Brain Research Reviews
AB  - Our understanding of when the fetus can experience pain has been largely shaped by neuroanatomy. However, completion of the cortical nociceptive connections just after mid-gestation is only one part of the story. In addition to critically reviewing evidence for whether the fetus is ever awake or aware, and thus able to truly experience pain, we examine the role of endogenous neuroinhibitors, such as adenosine and pregnanolone, produced within the feto-placental unit that contribute to fetal sleep states, and thus mediate suppression of fetal awareness. The uncritical view that the nature of presumed fetal pain perception can be assessed by reference to the prematurely born infant is challenged. Rigorously controlled studies of invasive procedures and analgesia in the fetus are required to clarify the impact of fetal nociception on postnatal pain sensitivity and neural development, and the potential benefits or harm of using analgesia in this unique setting.

TI  - Prenatal depression effects on the fetus and neonate.
AU  - Field, Tiffany
T2  - Emotional development: Recent research advances.
AB  - Prenatal depression effects include excessive activity in the fetus and unresponsive behavior, low activity levels, indeterminate sleep, low vagal tone, and atypical patterns of frontal EEG activation in the newborn. The fetuses and neonates of depressed mothers differ as a function of their mothers' type of depressive behavior, including withdrawn or intrusive behavior. The different neurotransmitter imbalance in withdrawn and intrusive depressed mothers during pregnancy (elevated norepinephrine, depressed serotonin, and depressed dopamine in withdrawn mothers and elevated norepinephrine, depressed serotonin, but elevated dopamine in the intrusive mothers) may contribute to the differences noted in their fetuses and neonates. Fetal activity is greater in the fetuses of withdrawn mothers than the fetuses of intrusive mothers. By the neonatal stage, the physiological and biochemical profiles of these infants match their mothers' profiles. The differential dysregulation pattern noted at the neonatal period is then compounded by inadequate stimulation and arousal modulation from the depressed mothers, with the intrusive mothers being overstimulating and the withdrawn mothers being understimulating. By preschool, the children of withdrawn mothers are exhibiting internalizing problems and the children of intrusive mothers are showing externalizing problems. This review is uniquely focused on prenatal depression effects, and highlights the need for early identification and intervention for prenatal depression.

T2  - Sleep: Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research
AB  - Study Objectives: Recent studies suggest a specific association between intrauterine growth restriction that commonly occurs in preeclampsia and decreased maternal cardiac output. Sleep is associated with marked hypertension in preeclampsia. We therefore aimed to determine how sleep influences other hemodynamic parameters in preeclampsia, specifically to determine if sleep-induced exacerbation of hypertension was associated with reductions in cardiac output. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Setting: King George V, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Patients: Twenty-four women with severe preeclampsia and 15 control nulliparous subjects. Intervention: Full polysomnography including beat-to-beat blood-pressure recording. Stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and ejection duration were derived from the blood pressure waveform. Half of the 24 preeclamptic subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure and the other half to receive no treatment. Measurements and Results: Heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were similar in controls and patients with preeclampsia during wakefulness, while total peripheral resistance was significantly elevated. Sleep induced marked decrements in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output in preeclamptic subjects and resulted in further increments in total peripheral resistance. Cardiac output during sleep was correlated with fetal birth weight (r2 = 0.64, P < .001). When preeclamptic subjects were treated with continuous positive airway pressure, reductions in cardiac output were minimized, while increments in total peripheral resistance were also reduced. Conclusions: These data indicate that sleep is associated with adverse hemodynamic changes in women with preeclampsia. These changes are minimized with the use of continuous positive airway pressure. Reduced cardiac output during sleep may have an adverse effect on fetal development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is implicated in the control of circadian rhythms of gonadal function. Although several structures surrounding the SCN are sensitive to the effects of gonadal steroids, similar effects in the SCN remain unclear. For example, there are conflicting data on whether the SCN is sexually differentiated. This study attempted to determine sex differences in the number of SCN cells generated during late gestation, and if testosterone mediates these differences. Pregnant female rats were treated with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) on gestational day 18 (E18), the day when aromatase activity peaks in the developing rat fetus. These animals were also given injections of oil or testosterone propionate (10 mg/0.1 mL peanut oil) from E15 until parturition. Litters were allowed to survive until adulthood and were killed on postnatal day 60 (PN60). Following fixation, brain sections containing the SCN from these rats were processed for BrdU immunocytochemistry. A second set of SCN sections was processed for immunocytochemistry detecting BrdU and some of the cell groups prevalent within the SCN. Data showed that female rats have a higher number of cells labeled with BrdU in the SCN, particularly in the medial and caudal SCN. This sex difference was abolished in animals treated with testosterone during late gestation. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that BrdU-labeled cells were neurons expressing calbindin-D28K, vasoactive intestinal peptide and, to a lesser degree, vasopressin. Our results unveiled a previously unknown effect of gonadal steroids on the developing SCN, which may contribute to the emergence of gender-specific circadian rhythms.

TI  - Maternal cognitive functioning in pregnancy and its association with gestation, endocrine factors and fetal sex:  A longitudinal study in women from early pregnancy to the postpartum period.
AU  - Vanston, Claire M.
AB  - Research addressing the effects of maternal cognitive changes during pregnancy has yielded equivocal findings with both confirmatory and negative results appearing fairly equally in the literature. In an attempt to evaluate and further test this phenomena, 45 women where tracked from early pregnancy until postnatal resumption of menses. An age and education matched control group of 45 non-pregnant women were tested concurrently. At each of the five test sessions participants completed a battery of cognitive tests. Results showed no effect of pregnancy on any of the dependent measures, with pregnant women performing no worse than control women on the nine cognitive tasks administered. One possible explanation for this negative finding (and the research ambiguity in this area) could be linked to the sex of the fetus. When fetal sex was considered, a selective and persistent effect on maternal cognitive function was observed. Those women pregnant with sons consistently outperformed women pregnant with daughters on the tests of working memory. On several other cognitive tests fetal sex was unrelated to maternal performance. This effect was evident from the first test session and persisted until the final session and was unrelated to sleep, mood and demographic measures. This result suggests either a fetal-derived factor that differs in type or concentration between male and female fetuses may influence the mothers' cognition both during pregnancy and into the postnatal phase. Or, alternatively, qualities inherent to the mother may be related to both her propensity to deliver a specific sex and her cognitive profile. Both possible explanations are discussed.

T2  - Maternal and Child Health Journal
AB  - Objectives: Reduction of prone infant sleep position has been the main public health effort to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Methods: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a stratified random sample of women after a live birth. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response). Results: Overall, 9.2% of all women "usually" chose prone infant sleep position, while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics (6.1%) or other sites (8.3%). Compared to health department prenatal clinic patients, private prenatal patients were more likely to choose prone infant sleep position, adjusted odds ratio=4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-13.92). Conclusions: Health Department clinics have done a better job than private physicians in educating mothers about putting infants to sleep on their backs. Providers--especially private providers--should continue to stress the importance of supine sleep position for infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Mutual regulation: The relationship between maternal-fetal attachment, maternal prenatal sleep, and postnatal infant sleep patterns.
AU  - Spletzer, Petra Ursel
AB  - This study examines the prenatal-postnatal relationship. Recent studies have shown that a mother's psychological state and attachment to her fetus affects the infant's regulatory capacities after birth. Ninety women during their 35th to 40th week of singleton, low-risk pregnancies and their infants postnatally participated in this study. The study used the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI) (Muller, 1993), which consists of 21 items and assesses the mother's prenatal attachment to her fetus. The participants charted their prenatal sleep and their 1-week-old and 3-month-old infant's postnatal sleep over a 3-day period using the Sleep/Activity Record (SAR) (Barnard, 1999). Assessed infant sleep characteristics included average number of sleep segments, longest sustained sleep, and total sleep over three 24-hour periods. These scores were then correlated with the PAI score and total maternal prenatal sleep. Correlational analysis revealed that contrary to expectations, PAI scores did not correlate with either infant sleep segments or longest sustained sleep. The study found an inverted correlation between PAI scores and infant total sleep at 1 week. The study also found an inverted correlation between maternal total sleep and infant sleep segments at 1 week and 3 months. Furthermore, 1-week-old infant sleep correlated with 3-month-old infant sleep. The study extends current literature on prenatal to postnatal continuity.

AU  - Gruber, Christian J.

T2  - Maturitas
AB  - Interactions exist between progestins and the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A where C₂₁-steroids function as activators. Other interactions between progesterone and neurotransmitter systems include stimulation of dopamine release in striatal tissue, stimulation of GnRH release from hypothalamic neurons and inhibition of opioid receptor binding and activation. Cyproterone acetate increases dopaminergic responses and binds to opiate receptors independently of its classical effect on the androgen receptor. Progesterone substitution in perimenopausal women promotes length and quality of sleep. Progestins also play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Migraine symptoms occur predominantly during the perimenstrual stage. Women who suffer from menstrual migraine triggered by premenstrual progesterone loss often benefit from cyclic progesterone administration. Women whose migraine symptoms subside during pregnancy, however, benefit from intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate. Myelination of axons is promoted when progesterone is added to cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia. Progestins promote the growth of meningioma as progesterone receptors predominate in meningioma tissue. Progesterone and synthetic progestins should therefore not be prescribed in these patients.

AB  - The signs that characterize motoric, psychosocial and mental development, and temperament of children were selected from the data of mothers and attending physicians in examination of children at the age of 3 and 5 years within the scope of the prospective longitudinal study-ELSPAC. The prenatal and early postnatal exposition of children to cigarette smoke was assessed according to mothers' testimonies about their smoking behavior, which was mapped 6 weeks after child delivery. The followed data was gathered about 3,400 3-year-old and 4,983 5-year-old children: 90.5% of children in both stages of the examination was not exposed to smoking; 7.2% of children had mothers that smoked during the whole pregnancy period. The prenatal expositions of children to passive smoking was related to significantly more frequent absence of skills requiring more complicated motoric coordination, as well as to occurrence of data on absentmindedness, inability to concentrate oneself, hyperactivity, absence of social plays and absence of contacts with other children, and manifestations of aggressive behavior. At the age of 5 years, the exposed group manifested more frequent signals of possible delay in school maturity development. The physicians, in both stage of examination, found in the exposed children-with greater frequency significance-a delayed mental development in the area of vocabulary-expression advancement, concentration, socialization, school maturity, and significant negativisms. Significantly higher was also the frequency of sleep and food disorders in these children, and-on the contrary, the lowest occurrence of the apparent right-hand preference.

Actigraphy was used to record and show time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small wristwatch-like Actiwatch® actometers. Nursing/feeding times were recorded by using the actometers' integrated event marker button. Recordings in both C-section groups were performed in the hospital; for neonates born vaginally and for some born by C-section, recordings were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation. Amount of sleep time during daytime, nighttime, and 24h, as well as sleep bouts during the daytime and nighttime, were compared. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Swann, Alan C.

A2  - Ginsberg, David L.
AB  - While the prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in women and men, the course of illness tends to be more severe in women. In 50% of women with bipolar disorder, illness onset occurs at or within 1 year of menarche. Despite this pattern, most women with bipolar disorder are not accurately diagnosed until they have had a child and developed an episode of PPD. The occurrence of PPD in a patient with recurrent depression but no history of mania or hypomania should raise the index of suspicion for the presence of an underlying bipolar disorder. Medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder can result in side effects, such as sexual dysfunction or weight gain, and in drug-drug interactions. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills while sodium valproate may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most common cause of menstrual disturbance in women of reproductive age. Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not protect against bipolar disorder relapse. Thus, physicians must be proactive in protecting the mother from relapse. In general, physicians should use nonpharmacologic measures as much as possible, pharmacology when necessary, and consider electroconvulsive therapy when the risks of medications are too great. Psychotic, floridly manic, or profoundly depressed patients should be given medication, for which information concerning safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding exist. For less severe problems, nonpharmacologic strategies can be employed and include promoting the maintenance of healthy nutrition and activity, protecting social and activity/sleep rhythms, educating patients and their families on how to recognize a prodrome of illness, and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address mild symptoms of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse.

T2  - Journal of Pediatric Psychology
AB  - Objective: To examine the association between maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and physiological measures of regulation, which included heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Methods: Potential mediators and moderators of this association were explored. Participants were 141 mother-infant dyads (77 cocaine exposed and 64 nonexposed) recruited at birth. Average infant HR and RSA was assessed at 4-8 weeks of age during a 15 minute period of sleep. Results: Results indicated a dose-dependent effect of prenatal exposure to cocaine on RSA. There was no evidence that fetal growth or other prenatal exposure to substances mediated this association or that fetal growth or maternal age moderated this association. Regression analyses also indicated that birth weight (BW), but not birthlength (BL), head circumference (HC) or other substance use, mediated the association between prenatal exposure to cocaine and heart rate. Conclusions: These results suggest that cocaine exposure is associated with physiological regulation at 4-8 weeks of age and highlight the importance of considering level of exposure when assessing infant outcomes.

For this purpose, we examined 24 h serum leptin profiles of ewes exposed to natural photoperiodic conditions and subjected to two different feeding schedules (regular feeding and fasting). The results show for the first time the existence of daily rhythm of plasma leptin in regularly fed ewes, with a minimum during the light phase and a peak during the dark phase. Daily rhythms of serum leptin persisted after 50 h of fasting, although fasting shifted the peak of the rhythm to the beginning of the light phase and significantly reduced daily leptin production. To gain a better understanding of the role of leptin in the temporal organization of physiological events related to pregnancy and lactation, we measured serum leptin profiles throughout 24 h in ewes either during pregnancy or lactation. Daily leptin rhythms were found to persist during pregnancy and lactation, but both physiological conditions altered leptin concentrations. Maternal serum leptin concentration rose between early and mid pregnancy, then decreased in the late pregnancy and during lactation. Daily serum leptin concentration was significantly lower in nonpregnant, nonlactating ewes, compared either to lactating or to early pregnant ewes.

AB  - Bright light therapy was shown to be a promising treatment for depression during pregnancy in a recent open-label study. In an extension of this work, we report findings from a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. Ten pregnant women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly assigned from April 2000 to January 2002 to a 5-week clinical trial with either a 7000 lux (active) or 500 lux (placebo) light box. At the end of the randomized controlled trial, subjects had the option of continuing in a 5-week extension phase. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version was administered to assess changes in clinical status. Salivary melatonin was used to index circadian rhythm phase for comparison with antidepressant results. Although there was a small mean group advantage of active treatment throughout the randomized controlled trial, it was not statistically significant. However, in the longer 10-week trial, the presence of active versus placebo light produced a clear treatment effect (p = .001) with an effect size (0.43) similar to that seen in antidepressant drug trials. Successful treatment with bright light was associated with phase advances of the melatonin rhythm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Maternal prenatal stress has been found to be related to over-activity and/or dysregulation of the HPA-system in the offspring. These effects are more readily apparent in response to novel situations. The aim of the present report was to examine whether pregnancy stress predicted HPA-axis reactions of children to the first day of school after the summer break. Children of mothers with more prenatal stress were compared to those of mothers with less stress. Habituation was studied by comparisons between the first school day and a second school day a week later. Finally, cortisol levels at school were compared to those of a weekend day. The participants were 29 mother-child pairs (20 girls and nine boys, mean age 5.31 years, SD = 0.50). The children's cortisol levels were determined in saliva. Multilevel analysis (hierarchical linear modelling) was used to analyze the data. Both prenatal cortisol and pregnancy anxiety were related to the children's cortisol levels as a reaction to the first school day. Children whose mothers had higher levels of morning cortisol during pregnancy, and more fear of bearing a handicapped child showed higher levels of cortisol on school days. In addition, the circadian rhythm of cortisol on school days appeared to have a steeper slope as compared to that of the circadian curve on a weekend day.

AB  - Few studies exist that identify a useful self-report measure of physical activity for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the self-report exercise diary with the pedometer and determine if self-report measurement provided useful physical activity measures during pregnancy. The pregnant women's sleep, parity, and related demographic factors were further analyzed for relationships to the physical activity measures. Physical activity was assessed in a sample of 94 pregnant midwestern U.S. women ages 18 to 38 years. The women wore a pedometer during all waking hours for 3 consecutive days at 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for a total of 6 days. During the same 6 days of monitoring, the women kept a diary account of the minutes they exercised per day. The pedometer and self-report exercise diary results correlated significantly (r = 49, p = .02). When examining for usefulness in measuring physical activity, a comparison of the women's occupational categories revealed no significant differences in self-reported minutes of exercise or pedometer counts per day.

AB  - Sleep disordered breathing can occur during pregnancy due to the development of hormonal changes and respiratory function abnormalities that perturb patency of the upper airways. Habitual snoring has been described in 25 p. 100 of the women during the third trimester of pregnancy. The incidence of sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome is unknown due to the lack of longitudinal epidemiological data, and results of the main studies are in favor of upper airway resistance syndrome. However, these sleep-related breathing disorders are more frequently associated with maternal and fetal complications such as maternal hypertension, pre eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. This article points out the importance of such associations because of the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure on the regression of these nocturnal respiratory and vascular complications.

AB  - Context: The precise function of sleep in animals and human beings is still unknown, and any sort of physical, social or psychological variation may change the normal sleep-wake cycle. Purpose: This research aims is to determine the sleep disorders (SD) for each of the three trimesters of the pregnancy comparing them to the pre-pregnancy state (PG). Method: SD were investigated in three hundred pregnant women 11- to 40-years-old through with a brief clinical interview based on directed questions. One hundred pregnant women were considered for each trimester. Results: The rate of pregnant women with insomnia increased by 23% in the 2nd trimester (pnd trimester (prd trimester (prd trimester (pst trimester, by 80% in the 2nd trimester and by 84% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.001).

AB  - A descriptive, correlational design was used to examine the associations of sleep quality and stage of illness with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected African-American women. Participants were recruited from 12 health clinics and AIDS service organizations (ASO) in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The sample consisted of 144 African-American women who ranged in age from 20 to 48 years (m = 34.8, SD = 6.8). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered. Participants were categorized as good sleepers (PSQI global score <7) or poor sleepers (PSQI global score ≥ 7) using the median global sleep quality score. Differences in HRQOL between good and poor sleepers, as measured by the SF-36, were tested using MANOVA. Good sleepers scored significantly higher (p < 0.0001) for each SF-36 quality of life dimension and the mental and physical health summary scores. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sleep quality is associated with HRQOL, independent of the individual's stage of illness, more so with mental HRQOL than with physical HRQOL. The results suggest that treatment for poor sleep quality should be a primary concern for the treatment of HIV infection and a means for improving HRQOL.

T2  - Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience
AB  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are recognized as times of vulnerability to mood disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis. Recently, changes in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review what is known about changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum "blues," depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited. Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period, particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders.

AB  - Study Objectives: To clarify the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the relationship between sleep problems and RLS, in order to discuss ways for pregnant women to obtain comfortable sleep and to improve the health of both the mother and child. Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey Setting: 500 clinical institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of organizations identified in a survey by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these 500 institutions, 260 participated in the survey. Participants: 16,528 pregnant women living in Japan Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: In this survey of pregnant women, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%. An analysis was conducted on the relationship between RLS and other factors such as subjective evaluation of sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awaking, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The result of this analysis suggested that women with these sleep-related problems were more likely to have RLS than those without. In addition, RLS was more prevalent in the later stages of pregnancy. Conclusion: In the pregnant women in our survey, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%, which is higher than the prevalence of RLS that has been found in the general public in a previous study. This suggests that RLS-related sleep problems may be an important public health issue among pregnant women in Japan. This finding may have implications for attempts to improve sleep hygiene in this group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

The anatomical and physiological reasons for these complaints are discussed in the following section.  Menstrual-Related Sleep Disorders / Grace W. Pien and Elizabeth A. Beothy / This chapter will examine changes in sleep and the circadian rhythm during normal menstrual cycles and will review how oral contraceptives and disorders of the menstrual cycle such as dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome affect sleep. Finally, we will describe the features of menstrual-related sleep disorders and review therapies for these conditions.  Sleep Disordered Breathing in Women / M. Safwan Badr / Sleep apnea affects both men and women and should be recognized and treated in both genders. This chapter will address the gender differences in physiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and polysomnographic features of sleep disordered breathing in women versus men.  Sleep During the Perimenopausal Period / Naomi L. Rogers and Ronald R. Grunstein / While much research and attention have focused on the effects of menopause and postmenopause on sleep and physiological changes, there are few reports on the sleep changes that manifest during the perimenopausal period. The primary physiological changes associated with perimenopause include changes in the length and frequency of the menstrual cycle, changes in blood sugar levels, weight gain, decreased sex drive, headaches, increased premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms, night sweats, hot flashes, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.  Sleep During Postmenopause / Karen E. Moe / Women and men experience many of the same age-related changes in sleep, though the extent of these changes appears to vary with gender. More older women than men have sleep complaints. Objective measures show that women are less likely to experience a decline in slowwave sleep (SWS) with age and more likely to experience problems with sleep maintenance. Sleep changes in older women are often associated with chronic physical or mental illness and related factors such as caregiving. In addition, the sleep of older women may be affected by some unique factors such as chronic hot flashes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by smoking and/or drinking. We investigate here the joint effect of smoking and drinking with respect to sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Methods: Survey of about 16,000 pregnant women in Japan, conducted in 2002 using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Both smoking and drinking increased the odds of sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness and restless legs syndrome. The joint odds ratios for smoking and drinking corresponded more or less to the products of the odds ratio for smoking or drinking. Conclusion: Smoking and drinking are independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy, in addition to their other well-known side-effects.

AB  - Links between neonatal biological rhythms and the emergence of interaction rhythms were examined in 3 groups (N=71): high-risk preterms (HR; birth weight <1,000 g), low-risk preterms (LR; birth weight =1,700-1,850 g), and full-term (FT) infants. Once a week for premature infants and on the 2nd day for FT infants, sleep-wake cyclicity was extracted from 4-hr observations and cardiac vagal tone was measured. At term age, infant orientation was tested with the Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale. At 3 months, arousal modulation and emotion regulation were assessed, and mother-infant synchrony was computed from microanalysis of face-to-face interactions using time-series analysis. Sleep-wake amplitudes showed a developmental leap at 31 weeks gestation, followed by a shift in vagal tone at 34 weeks gestation. At term, differences among FT, LR, and HR infants were observed for biological rhythms in a linear-decline pattern. Sleep-wake cyclicity, vagal tone, newborn orientation, and arousal modulation were each uniquely predictive of mother-infant synchrony. The organization of physiological oscillators appears to lay the foundation for the infant's capacity to partake in a temporally matched social dialogue.

AB  - Epileptic comorbidity and its management in the contemporary therapeutic scene should not be unnoticed anymore. To ignore psychiatric comorbidity of a chronic disorder such as epilepsy means approaching the subject in a partial way and thus preventing the implementation of an integrated treatment. Emphasis is made in treatment attachment, not only of convulsive crises, but also of comorbid psychiatric symptoms and disorders. This paper reviews the therapeutic approaches, specially the pharmacological ones, of epileptic comorbid disorders, including depressive syndromes, suicide attempts, anxiety, psychotic, sleep and sexual disorders, pregnancy, psychomotor agitation, as well as self-medication and substance abuse. The appropriate management of the above mentioned comorbidity represents a definitive issue on these patients' life quality, and that is why health education directed to the community is an essential tool. Thus, an integrative view of the human being is not only a fundamental premise, but also a promoter of will and of the activities in favour of health.

AB  - 52 pregnant women recruited during their 2nd trimester were given EEGs and divided into greater relative right and left frontal EEG activation groups. The greater relative right frontal EEG women had lower dopamine levels during their second trimester and lower dopamine and higher cortisol levels during the neonatal period. The newborns of the right frontal EEG mothers also showed greater relative right frontal EEG, had lower dopamine and serotonin levels, spent more time in indeterminate sleep and had inferior Brazelton scores. A discriminant function analysis based on the mothers' prenatal depression scores and biochemical measures correctly classified 74% of the women as greater relative right or left frontal EEG group members, (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 45 parturient women (aged 19–36 yrs) were divided based on a psychological poll into subgroups with a high (changed mental state, CMS) and low (unchanged mental state, UMS) number of signs of changes in the MS during and after delivery. The MSs studied included active and passive wakefulness, dozing, and sleep. Background EEG was recorded before and after delivery. EEG processing included the calculation of indices of the basic rhythms, the parameters of auto- and cross-correlation functions, and the conditional probabilities of the mutual transitions of the EEG wave components that belong to the basic rhythm components according to their duration. Statistical comparison of the EEG characteristics of the subgroups, as well as their comparison with similar characteristics of the reference group of healthy nulliparous women, showed that the subgroups differed in some parameters; the differences were generalized by lead zones. The EEG characteristics of the CMS subgroup differed from those of the reference group more than those of the UMS subgroup. The differences between the 2 subgroups suggest an imbalance of the regulatory mechanisms in the former with the predominance of excitation at the predelivery stage and a more manifest physiological cerebral reaction to the delivery.

TI  - The infant 'motoric' dream: Where mothers' eye and scientist meet.
AU  - Salzarulo, Piero

T2  - Infant and Child Development
AB  - 120 pregnant women were asked about their ideas on infants' dreams. Two interviews were undertaken, before birth and 1 month after birth. The majority of women (both before and after birth) responded that infants dream. The reasons why they attributed dreaming to infants changed from before birth to after birth. At one month, these reasons were based on infant movements and behaviours, factors also taken into consideration by sleep researchers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry
AB  - The reviewer explains that this book (J. Martín Maldonado-Durán (Ed), 2001; see record 2003-02314-000)is divided into four sections (1) Theoretical framework, (2) Therapeutic approaches to relationships and their disturbances, (3) Therapeutic approaches to psychophysiological disturbances, and (4) illustrative case examples. All of these sections are well served by the individual chapters and, while a broad range of material is presented, the book retains theoretical coherence. Section II is weighty and deals with attachment during pregnancy and the nature of transgenerational patterns in attachment. Therapeutic interventions are dealt with in a chapter, which promotes attachment theory as a powerful therapeutic tool, balanced by the subsequent chapter, which considers the potential of a wide range of interventions, including cognitive behavioural and systemic approaches. The third section of the book deals with epidemiology, differential diagnosis and management of sleep, feeding and excessive and persistent crying. The reviewer's only criticism of the book is the relative lack of explicit commentary on therapeutic outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The discussion article speaks about the behavior of the fetus during the prenatal and postnatal periods. The development of the fetus has been discussed. The development of the brain and the lungs has been studied. It has been found that if in a prenatal stage a pregnant woman is given steroids then there is lower number of neurons in the hippocampus. The usage of steroids during pregnancy does not have extra positive effects on lung development. The movement of twins has also been discussed and studied. Some studies say that in twin pregnancies the sleep states will be a bit shorter, certainly not the non-REM sleep state, but that is probably biased, because the other one has been kicking and that is not really a nervous system effect. The consumption of alcohol during the pregnancy stage is not preferable as it hampers the development of the lungs and the liver. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Annual review of nursing research, 2001: Women's health research.
T3  - Annual review of nursing research.
AB  - This chapter provides a review and synthesis of research on women's sleep and fatigue from a nursing perspective. Most of the research involves four primary issues for women: menstrual cycles, childbearing, chronic mental or physical illness, and oncology. Research with healthy women focused on diurnal fluctuations in fatigue and relationships to sleep, without regard for exercise or level of daytime activity. Research on chronic illness and cancer fatigue focused on general fatigue and its impact on activity, without regard for sleep or therapeutic use of rest and naps. A comparison of these two areas highlights gaps in nursing knowledge about sleep and fatigue. Further research is needed to understand relationships between nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, and symptoms related to poor quality of life. From a synthesis of these studies, nonpharmacologic interventions that could be prove useful in promoting a higher quality of life for those with either acute or chronic fatigue are then proposed.

AB  - Women have twice the incidence of major depression compared with men. They are prone to develop episodes of depression during times of reproductive hormonal change at puberty, with use of oral contraceptives, during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, postpartum, and during the perimenopause (B. L. Parry 1995a). A. Wirz-Justice (1995) describes the variety of disturbances in biological rhythms observed in mood disorders. This report involving 12 women describes the chronobiological disturbances observed in female-specific mood disorders, namely, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, pregnancy and postpartum depression, and menopause. It is hypothesized that changing reproductive hormones, by affecting the synchrony or coherence between components of the circadian system, may alter amplitude or phase (timing) relationships and thereby contribute to the development of mood disorders in predisposed individuals.

AB  - Presents the case study of the use of kangaroo care (KC) for adoptive parents. An adopted female was born at 27 wks gestation with respiration distress syndrome. Despite the critical situation, KC was begun at 3 days after birth and involved 2-hr daily bonding sessions as the infant was placed on either parent's chest. Sessions took place in the neonatal intensive care unit on a recliner where both parent and child could sleep. Both parents reported feelings of immediate and intense connection to their adoptive daughter and felt that KC provided an important opportunity to bond.

AB  - The study presents a survey of the effects of pregnancy on parasomnias. In an area of a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community, women were interviewed during and after their pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess the frequency of their parasomnias. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last one the 3 months after delivery. Altogether 325 mothers filled all the five questionnaires and constitute the study group. The total number of parasomnias declined during pregnancy and even more among the primiparas than among the multiparas. Among various parasomnias reported, sleep talking and sleepwalking decreased from the prepregnant period to the second trimester, and the reported sleep starts also diminished from the prepregnant time to the first trimester, but these phenomena did not change during the follow-up. Altogether 55.7% of the women reported having nightmares 3 months before the pregnancy, and 47.7, 49.5, 41.2 and 40.3%, respectively, at first, second and third trimester and after the delivery. Reported hypnagogic hallucinations decreased from the prepregnant time to the first trimester, but returned thereafter to the previous level.

T2  - Chronobiology International
AB  - During the first weeks of life, preterm neonates show fewer circadian rhythms in their physiological parameters than full-term neonates. To determine whether preterm neonates differ in their temporal adaptation to the daynight cycle from full-term neonates at the early age of 1 week, we compared activity-rest behavior of both groups. Activity-rest behavior of 10 neurologically healthy preterm neonates (born in 34th to 36th week of gestation) and 10 neurologically healthy full-term neonates (born in 37th to 42nd week of gestation) was monitored longitudinally for 8 successive days in the first 2 weeks of life. Actigraphy was used to register and display time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small actometers, which resemble a wristwatch. Nursing/feeding was recorded using the actometer's integrated event marker button. Recordings for preterm neonates were conducted in the hospital; recordings for full-term neonates were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Amounts of daily sleep time, nightly sleep time, and sleep time during 24h were compared. Nursing/feeding epochs were also analyzed for 5 preterm and 5 full-term neonates to compare their food intake behavior. The majority of preterm neonates showed a multitude of ultradian frequencies in their spectra. In contrast, several full-term neonates showed a distinct circadian frequency. In preterm neonates, average nightly sleep and average daily sleep of all recorded days were very similar, but after the fourth day of life, only average nightly sleep increased. In full-term neonates, average nightly and daily sleep time of all recorded days differed by about 1h. Average sleep time during 24h for preterm and full-term neonates was similar. Preterm neonates showed longer intervals between events of food intake than full-term neonates. The circadian peaks in the frequency spectra of full-term neonates may indicate the initial adaptation in the first week of life to a 24h day. This is in agreement with our results concerning the different durations of nightly and daily sleep. The increase in nightly sleep time of preterm neonates may be attributed to the progressing adaptation to a circadian activity- rest pattern.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that autonomic dysfunction may be involved in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The major risk factors for SIDS are the prone sleeping position and maternal smoking. Our aim was to examine the effects of sleeping position and maternal smoking on the postnatal maturation of autonomic function by examining heart rate responses following arousal in healthy term infants. Twenty-four infants (11 born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and 13 to mother who did not smoke) were studied using daytime polysomnography and multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cm H₂0) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). We demonstrated no difference between smoking and non-smoking groups of infants in any of our measurements, and thus combined data from the groups. Baseline (BHR) was elevated in the prone compared to the supine position in quiet sleep (QS) at 2-3 weeks (p < 0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.001), and in active sleep (AS) at 2-3 and 5-6 months (p<0.05). BHR was significantly elevated in AS compared to QS in the supine position at all ages (p<0.01) and in the prone position at 2-3 (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.05)...

AB  - Investigated the welfare of pregnant mares kept in straight stalls for 6 mo and given only limited exercise, conditions similar to those in the pregnant mare urine industry. 16 pregnant mares were randomly assigned to 2 groups: EX (exercised in paddock 30 min per day) or NoEX (exercised for one 30-min period every 14 days). Behavior was recorded on videotape once per week for 24 hrs. Major behaviors were eating hay, standing, and stand-resting. There was no differences between groups in stall behaviors or the number of foot lifts per min. Nine of 16 mares were not observed in recumbency throughout the 6-mo period, suggesting that horses with no experience in straight stalls may be reluctant to lie down. 13 of 16 mares dropped to their knees at least once, probably during REM sleep while standing. There were no significant differences between groups in baseline plasma cortisol levels or in cortisol response to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). After 30 min exercise, NoEX mares showed an increase in cortisol; EX mares showed a decrease. NoEX horses confined for 2 wks trotted more and galloped more than EX horses released daily, but walked less and grazed less. Confined horses showed rebound locomotion (compensatory increase) when released from confinement, indicating a response to exercise deprivation.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about sex differences in human fetal heart and behaviour. Patients and methods: One hundred twenty-three nulliparous healthy women carrying a male (n=56) or female (n=67) fetus participated in this study. All pregnancies remained uncomplicated and delivery was uneventful. Ultrasound observation of fetal general movements (GM) was performed for 1 h at 15-17 (T1) and 27-28 (T2) weeks of gestation and for 2 h at 37-39 weeks (T3). Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring occurred simultaneously with fetal ultrasound observations at T2 and T3. The incidence of GM (percentage of time), FHR and its variability, and the incidences of fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) A-D and behavioural states 1F-4F were compared between boys and girls. Results: There were no significant differences between males and females in the distribution of HRP A-D, overall behavioural state distribution, and basal FHR, FHR variability or the presence of GM during quiet and active sleep. A Time × Sex interaction effect for GM assessed for total record length and a higher %GM in male fetuses at term age were the only significant findings. Conclusion: Our data do not provide evidence for a difference in fetal functional development or maturation between the two sexes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Clinical Pediatrics
AB  - The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has alerted pediatricians to the importance of safe sleep environment for infants. Prior studies have demonstrated that health care professional advice is influential in determining infant care practices and the reduction of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The authors surveyed a random sample of 3,717 physicians in North Carolina and the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area to determine knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction among physicians caring for pregnant women and infants. Of the 835 physicians who responded, most were aware of prone sleeping and cigarette smoke exposure as risk factors for SIDS. Almost all physicians agree that there are measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS, and they consider it important to discuss SIDS and SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents of young infants. In spite of this belief, only 56% of family/general practitioners, 18% of obstetrician-gynecologists, and 79% of pediatricians discuss SIDS routinely. Overall, pediatricians are more likely to be aware of the AAP recommendation and to discuss SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Lee, Brenda

T2  - The Journal of Neuroscience
AB  - It has been proposed that prostaglandin (PG) D₂ induces physiological sleep in mammals by acting on sleep centers located in the anterior hypothalamus. In fetal sheep, definitive rapideye- movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep states appear at ∼125 d gestation (term is ∼147 d). In adult animals, PGD synthase (PGDS) (functionally and structurally homologous to β-trace protein) is secreted into CSF with a circadian pattern, with the highest concentrations present during sleep. In this study we show that PGDS/β-trace protein is present in fetal sheep CSF at 125 and 135 d gestation but not at 90 d gestation. SeCl₄, a specific inhibitor of PGDS, was given to unanesthetized fetal sheep (130–140 d gestation) by intracerebroventricular infusion at a dose of 25, 100, 500, or 1000 pmol/min for 4 hr. Artificial CSF was infused in control experiments. Arousal behavior, defined as the presence of nuchal muscle electromyogram activity, electro-ocular activity, and breathing movements during low-amplitude electrocortical activity, increased from 3.8 ± 1 min/hr to 6.6 ± 0.5 and 7.0 ± 0.3 min/hr at doses of 100 and 500 pmol/min, respectively (p p < 0.05). When 500 pmol/min PGD₂ was infused immediately after a 4 hr infusion of SeCl₄ (500 pmol/min), the SeCl₄-induced increase in arousal behavior was abolished. Together, the presence of PGDS/β- trace protein in fetal CSF in late gestation and the effects of SeCl₄ in increasing the incidence of arousal-like behavior suggest that PGD₂ has a role in the induction and maintenance of prenatal sleep.

T2  - Military Medicine
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether stress, sleep disturbance, or fatigue at 22 to 26 weeks of gestation is related to the incidence of preterm labor and birth in military women. Data were collected prospectively by questionnaires measuring factors contributing to preterm labor and birth. Hours worked per week were ascertained by telephone until the participants delivered. Postpartum medical records were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. There was a trend for preterm labor to be associated with lower perceived fatigue severity, low sleep disturbance, and more negative life events. Officer rank was related to both preterm labor and delivery. Findings indicate that the perception of fatigue may be protective against preterm birth and that military officer rank is a risk factor for preterm labor and birth.

AB  - Explored risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among American Indians. A population-based case-control study of 33 SIDS infants and 66 matched living controls was carried out. Data sources included standardized parental interview, medical record abstraction, autopsy protocol, and infant death review. The proportions of case and control infants who were usually placed prone to sleep (15.2% and 13.6%, respectively), who shared a bed with parents (59.4% and 55.4 %), or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (69.7% and 54.6 %) were similar. However, mothers of 72.7% of case infants and 45.5% of control infants engaged in binge drinking during pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression revealed significant associations between SIDS and 2 or more layers of clothing on the infant, any visits by a public health nurse, periconceptional maternal alcohol use, and maternal first-trimester binge drinking. Public health nurse visits, maternal alcohol use during the periconceptional period and first trimester, and layers of clothing appear to be risk factors for SIDS among Northern Plains Indians. Strengthening public health nurse visiting programs and programs to reduce alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age could potentially reduce the high rate of SIDS.

Subjects were 10 primipara (aged 26- 40 yrs) and 12 non-pregnant women (aged 28-39 yrs). Their polysomnographic recordings were made using a Medilog recorder at home. In interrupted sleep, low sleep efficiency, decreased total sleep time, and a decreased percentage of stage 2 were significantly observed compared with non-pregnant women. Sleep parameters of non-interrupted sleep, except for increased percentage of stage 4, did not show any significant differences from non-pregnant women. Mothers sleep fluctuated between interrupted sleep similar to the early post-partum sleep from 1 to 6 weeks and non-interrupted sleep with increased stage 4.

AB  - 48 newborns (62% female) were divided on the basis of greater relative right (GRRF) versus greater relative left frontal (GRLF) EEG to determine whether these groups differed in other ways at the neonatal period including behavior physiology, and biochemistry. The authors also were interested in whether these EEG patterns were related to any prenatal maternal variables (PMV) including mood states and biochemistry as well as fetal activity. The GFFR EEG newborns had mothers with lower prenatal and postnatal serotonin and higher postnatal cortisol levels. The mothers of the GRRF EEG newborns also had GRRF EEG activation and lower vagal tone. The GRRF EEG newborns themselves had elevated cortisol levels, showed a greater number of state changes during sleep/wake behavior observations, and performed less optimally on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment (T.B. Brazelton, 1973) including the habituation, motor range of state, excitability, and depressive symptoms scales. Data suggest that GRRF EEG newborns may be at greater risk for developmental problems than those with GRLF EEG activation. In addition, a discriminant function analysis correctly classified 67% of the newborns' EEG by PMV, suggesting that these might be used to target pregnant women for prenatal intervention.

AB  - This book demonstrates how health psychology has risen to the challenge to find new ways to reach and treat at-risk populations. Using as a springboard their experiences in responding to the HIV/AIDS crisis over nearly two decades, chapter authors illustrate how they identified avenues for intervention and new targets for behavior change and designed new methods to address critical problems. Each chapter presents the theoretical rationale for a host of strategies, empirical validation for the effectiveness with a specific population or presenting problem, and step-by-step procedures for implementation. Experts demonstrate how basic behavioral science principles were used to develop intervention to target individuals, families, small groups, and communities. They share guidance for treating chronic pain, sleep disturbance, noncompliance with complex medical regimens, and the miracle-cure/quick-fix mentality. They describe their successes in tailoring interventions to specific risk populations, such as adolescents, pregnant women, African American women, gay men, and IV drug users. These findings are invaluable for addressing a wide range of public health concerns, from sexually transmitted diseases to coping with chronic illness.

AB  - Thirty-eight 1st-time mothers were recruited from childbirth classes and were assessed at 4 different time periods: the last trimester of pregnancy, 2-4 weeks postpartum, 12-16 weeks postpartum, and 12-15 months postpartum. Measures included a daily sleep-wake diary and a depression scale (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, CES-D). Results reveal significant differences in weekday night sleep schedules (rise time, time awake due to disruptions, and nap time) at 2-4 weeks postpartum in comparison to other times of measurement. Total sleep time and bedtime was not significantly different between times of measurement. More depressive symptoms were reported at 2-4 weeks postpartum than at later postpartum measurements. Mothers who developed clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D ≥ 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum reported more total sleep time, later rise times, and more time napping at the end of pregnancy in comparison to those mothers that reported fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D < 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum.

T2  - Child: Care, Health and Development
AB  - Examined the development of adult-like biorhythms in infants as measured by the age-related fall of deep body temperature with sleep. This papers reports on 2 twin sets, where differences with singletons are identified. Both twins were seen at home from the age of 6 wks. Deep body temperature was monitored overnight. Results show that the pattern of body temperature change was similar for twins as for singletons, but sibling comparison shows differences, which may be unique to twins, and highlights the shortcomings of comparison with singletons. Within the first set, maturation occurs simultaneously at 15 wks, perhaps slightly delayed as a consequence of being 36 wks gestation, or perhaps to zygosity, since dizygosity appears to be the likely origin of these twins. The differences in twin set 2 show a more than 5 wk separation, with the larger female infant later than her smaller brother. It is concluded that this contradicts the findings in singletons where females and larger infants tend to develop earlier than smaller males.

AB  - This open-label prospective study examined maternal and neonatal saftey and efficacy outcome measures during and following prenatal buprenophine exposure. Three opioid-dependent pregnant women received 8 or 12 mg sublingual buprenorphine tablets daily for 15–16 weeks prior to delivery. Results showed that buprenorphine in combination with comprehensive prenatal care was safe and effective for these women. Prenatal exposure to buprenorphine resulted in normal birth outcomes, a mean of 4.33 days hospitalization, and a "relatively mild" neonatal abstinence syndrome comprised primarily of tremors, hyperactive moro and shortened sleep after feeding. The infants required no pharmacological treatment. Onset of neonatal abstinence signs occurred within the first 12 hrs after birth, peaked by 72 hrs, and returned to below pre-12 hr levels by 120 hrs. It is concluded that buprenorphine has potential utility for the treatment of pregnant opioid-dependent women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This longitudinal study investigated sleep-wake behavior patterns during and after pregnancy, using an actimeter worn on the non-dominant wrist and a sleep log. Records were obtained from ten mothers, from the 34th week of gestation until the 15th week postpartum. Ten non-pregnant women were used as a control group, data being collected from them for 2 weeks. The sleep-wake behavior after delivery, obtained from wrist actigraphy, was greater in the postpartum period. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and circadian amplitude decreased in the weeks immediately following parturition, but wake after sleep onset increased. Subsequently, all the sleep and circadian variables improved slightly, but they had not returned to the levels of the non-pregnant control group even by the 15th postpartum week. The length of daytime naps increased, in order to make up for nocturnal sleep deprivation when the number of awakenings during nighttime had increased. There were significant positive correlations between total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and the length of daytime naps, but the numbers of awakenings at night and daytime naps did not show this correlation. The total sleep time indicated by sleep logs tended to be greater than that indicated by actigraphy, but wake after sleep onset tended to be underestimated by the sleep logs. The implications of these results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined activity–rest patterns of couples during late pregnancy and the alterations in the periodic structure of parental and neonatal time patterns during the 1st 4 mo after birth. The effects of late pregnancy and birth to the mother's rest–activity patterns and those of the father and, what time pattern the infant developed were examined. How activity patterns of the entire family agree or disagree with each other and how the infant synchronizes with the environment were investigated. Activity data of 7 families were recorded. Parental activity was recorded at the beginning of the 37th wk of gestation, and continued with the infants' recordings in 3 series of 3 wks each until 4 mo after birth. Records were kept of household routines, parental activities, type of feeding, initiation of sleep or waking up. Activity data of 7 non-pregnant women were used as a control. Irregular nocturnal activity epochs occurred frequently in pregnant women and were absent in non-pregnant women. Period lengthenings and shortenings of the circadian rhythms appeared in both parents from prepartum to postpartum. Activity at night increased from prepartum to postpartum in parents. All 7 infants showed a predominant circadian rhythm between day 8 and 19 after birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health
AB  - Examined specific sleep characteristics in neonatal opiate withdrawal, referred to as the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), by measuring sleep efficiency, deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation in 3 newborn groups (aged 36-42 wks gestation): (i) healthy term neonates; (ii) opiate-exposed neonates who were treated for opiate withdrawal; and (iii) a group of opiate exposed neonates who did not require treatment. 21 neonates were exposed to opiates during pregnancy. Polygraphic recordings of sleep, movement and breathing were made continuously after a daytime feed. Sleep deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation were found in newborns with NAS and were associated with the severity of the withdrawal. Neonates treated for NAS displayed increased wakefulness during early treatment (deprivation), but were similar to controls once stabilized. Both treated and non-treated groups had reduced amounts of quiet sleep (deprivation). Treated newborns showed an increase in indeterminate sleep (disorganization) and arousals-to-wakefulness (fragmentation). The findings contribute to a further understanding of the physiology underlying neonatal opiate withdrawal and suggest that some changes in sleep are due to opiate withdrawal but others may reflect opiate dependency in utero.

AB  - Common marmosets maintained in captivity were observed by focal sampling at 2 non-consecutive days per week during 2 nonconsecutive pregnancies (pregnancy 1: the last 8 fortnights before parturition; pregnancy 2: the last 5 ones) and after parturition (4 fortnights for both). The hourly percentiles of the duration of self-grooming and allogrooming interactions of the reproductive pair were submitted to analysis for 24-hrs. The reproductive female's progesterone was monitored by fecal collection twice a week. During pregnancy 1, all interactions of the reproductive pair showed a 24-hr statistically significant period. However, after parturition this periodicity is not present in some behaviors of the reproductive male. This animal presents the 24-hr periodicity only toward to the reproductive female, the subadult son and to the newborns. Hormonal levels of the reproductive female showed isolated increases above 100 ng/g at the 2nd and 3rd fortnight after parturition, but did not characterize ovulation. Between pregnancy 1 and 2, the family was increased by the birth of 4 Ss. During pregnancy 2, a statistically significant 24-hr period was found only in self-grooming of the reproductive male and female, and in the interactions between the reproductive pair.

T2  - Biological Rhythm Research
AB  - Rat or hamster pups exposed to constant light or darkness since birth exhibit many circadian rhythms synchronized with those of the mother. During early development, a number of cues derived from the maternal circadian system synchronize the fetal and neonatal circadian clock. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation during early pregnancy disrupts maternal synchronization of parotid α-amylase and testicular malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythms in rat pups. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation was used to study potential agents able to synchronize the fetal or neonatal circadian clock. The present authors studied the synchronizing effect of a benzodiazepine compound, diazepam. This GABAA agonist synchronized testicular malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity of pups when it was injected to sympathetic denervated pregnant dams (from the 14th to the 20th day of gestation) or orally administered to the pups (from the 10th to 24th day of life). Co-injection of diazepam and GABAA antagonist, flumazenil, blocked the synchronizing effect of diazepam. The results demonstrate that diazepam has a synchronizing effect on the development of the circadian clock in rats and suggest that modulation of maternal GABAA could participate in mammalian maternal synchronization.

AB  - Assessed the level of recognition and knowledge about treatment of depression by General Practitioners (GPs). Questionnaires completed by 2,500 GPs attending a series of workshops aimed at improving their knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of depression were analyzed. Findings suggest that the majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge and skills in counseling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms used to identify depression were sleep disorders, and only 54% listed depressed mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) major depressive disorder, which supports views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. 47% of GPs used medicine together with nonpharmacologicai treatment in the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range recommended in the product information.

AB  - Attempted an intervention against alcohol-induced damage by treating pregnant mice with peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-hr post-alcohol administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

AB  - The birth of a healthy child is supposed to be a joyous time for you, but post-delivery hormonal imbalances and sleep deprivation can overwhelm you with tears, anxiety, and depression. A range of negative emotional reactions--categorized as postpartum depression (PPD)--hits over 400,000 new mothers each year, and an astounding 8 in 10 women will experience some kind of mood alteration during or following pregnancy. Based on original research and clinical practice, this book provides a scientifically proven plan for beating PPD. For the first time in 1 book, 3 authors with complementary degrees combine their expertise in obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, and parenting to provide you, your partner, and your family with specific, healing steps as well as up-to-date information on: the medications--from alternative therapies to prescribed antidepressants--you can take during pregnancy and following childbirth, even while breastfeeding; why getting counseling can be an important part of your recovery, and advice on choosing the kind that is right for you; how you can bond with your new baby despite your mood, and invaluable tips for postpartum parenting; and the ways in which your partner may also be suffering and what can be done about it.

TI  - Developing a parental identity:  Expectations about parenthood and descriptions of self as parent.
AU  - Delmore-Ko, Patricia Michelle
AB  - The purpose of the two studies described in this thesis was to investigate and develop the notion of a parental identity. During the transition to parenthood, one's identity as a parent is rapidly developing. The initial nature of this identity may be manifested in the kinds of expectations one has about what parenthood may be like. Thus, in study one, the relationship between individuals' prenatal expectations about parenthood and their postnatal experiences was examined. During their third trimester of pregnancy, 73 primiparous couples were interviewed and asked open-ended questions regarding their expectations about becoming parents. A content analysis of their prenatal responses was conducted to examine the nature and style of their expectations. Cluster analysis of women's expectations identified three clusters labelled Prepared, Fearful, and Complacent. Six- and 18-month postnatal comparisons of these clusters indicated that women in the Prepared cluster had significantly lower levels of stress and higher levels of self-esteem than women in both the Fearful and Complacent clusters. Cluster analysis of men's expectations replicated these three clusters and generated a fourth style of conceptualizing parenthood that was labelled Mixed. Postnatal comparisons indicated that men in the Prepared cluster had significantly lower levels of stress than did men in the Complacent cluster. In addition, there was a marginally significant effect of depression with men in the Prepared cluster scoring lower than men in the Complacent cluster. Gender differences were apparent in two distinct areas: the specific content of their thoughts and the time orientation of their thoughts. Women, more often then men, expressed concern regarding their ability to parent effectively, the lack of sleep they expected to get, and the labour/delivery process. Women were more likely to speak of their unborn child in terms of it being an infant. Men talked more often about playing with and teaching their child and spoke about their unborn child in terms of it being a child or an adolescent. Results are discussed in terms of the content of expectations about parenthood, gender differences in expectations, and the relationship between individuals' prenatal expectations and their postnatal experiences of parenthood. Results are also interpreted in terms of their contribution to the early development of one's identity as a parent. Based on the results of study one, study two was designed to further investigate and understand the notion of a more mature stage of parental identity in women. Using the same qualitative methodology as in study one, mothers of children aged three to eight were asked open-ended questions regarding descriptions of themselves as parents, how they felt and thought about being parents, and what they believed was their role as parents. Cluster analysis of their responses resulted in three distinct clusters of women labelled Stressed, Teaching, and Nurturant. Analysis comparing the clusters across a variety of behavioural components of parenting indicated that individuals in the Stressed cluster perceived there to be more parenting stress in their lives than individuals described as Nurturant, and they also reported having more difficulty dealing with the demands of their children than individuals in the Teaching cluster. Results are discussed in terms of the development of parental identity and the relationship between parental identity and parenting behaviour.

T2  - Chronobiology International
AB  - Despite poor sensitivity and specificity, office blood pressure (BP) determinations are still the "gold standard" for diagnosing gestational hypertension. This prospective blind study evaluates the prognostic value of office values as compared with ambulatory monitoring in pregnancy. We analyzed 2175 BP series systematically sampled from 355 non-preeclamptic pregnant women for 48 h every 4 wks from the first hospital visit until delivery. Women were divided for comparative purposes into three groups: "detected" gestational hypertension, defined on the basis of casual clinical BP> 140/90 mmHg after 20 wks of gestation and hyperbaric index (area of BP excess above the upper limit of a time-specified tolerance interval adjusted for the circadian pattern of the reference population) consistently above the threshold for diagnosing hypertension in pregnancy; "undetected" gestational hypertension, women with office BP0.715). In pregnancy, the hyperbaric index is markedly superior to office BP measurements for diagnosis of what should be truly considered gestational hypertension, and for prediction of the outcome of pregnancy.

AB  - Studied whether prenatal depression effects on the fetus and neonate vary by ethnicity and SES. 86 depressed pregnant women were compared by ethnic group, Hispanic and African-American, and by SES (upper/lower) on prenatal and neonatal outcome variables. The Hispanic mothers were older, had a higher SES and had higher prenatal norepinephrine levels. Their fetuses were also more active. At the neonatal period they had higher anger scores, but also higher serotonin levels, and their infants had higher dopamine and lower cortisol levels and they spent less time in deep and indeterminate sleep. The comparison by middle/lower SES revealed that the middle SES group was older, had more social support and showed less depressed affect but had higher norepinephrine levels prenatally. At the postnatal period the middle SES mothers had lower depression, anxiety and anger scores and lower norepinephrine levels. Their infants also had lower norepinephrine levels, fewer postnatal complications and were less excitable on the Neonatal Behaviour Assessment Scale.

T2  - Depression and Anxiety
AB  - One hundred sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anxiety during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high anxiety women also had high scores on depression and anger scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the fetuses of the high anxiety women were noted to be more active and to experience growth delays. The high anxiety mothers' high prenatal norepinephrine and low dopamine levels were followed by their neonates having low dopamine and serotonin levels. The high anxiety mothers' newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high anxiety mothers spent more time in deep sleep and less time in quiet and active alert states and showed more state changes and less optimal performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (motor maturity, autonomic stability and withdrawal). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the possible effects of reproductive experience (RE) on hypothalamic concentrations of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5HT) and their major metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), 3-methoxy mandelic acid (VMA) and 5-hydroxyindole 3-acetic acid (5HIAA), respectively. These parameters were measured in 92 pregnant rats during the light dark shift and the prolactin surges. Primi- and multigravid rats were sacrificed on the 7th-8th day of pregnancy between 1700 and 1900 hr (light-dark shift and diurnal prolactin surge) or 0200 and 0400 hr (nocturnal prolactin surge). The prolactin surge was confirmed and multigravid rats showed significantly lower serum prolactin levels as compared to primigravid rats between 0200 and 0400 hr. During the light-dark shift DA and NE concentrations increased while DOPAC/DA, HVA/DA and 5HIAA/5HT ratios decreased in multigravid rats compared to primigravid rats. Except for 5HIAA/5HT, these differences were not observed during the prolactin nocturnal surge. Results suggest that a previous reproductive experience induces central functional changes during pregnancy which are expressed differently according to the time of day.

AB  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as been found to be consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than full term infants. This study investigated whether a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia affected the maturation of arousal responses. 25 premature infants were studied. A perinatal risk score was determined for each infant and infants were divided into those with a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia (n = 16) and those without (n = 9). All infants were studied using daytime polysomnography on 3 occasions: (a) a preterm study around 36 wks gestation, (b) within 3 wks of term, and (c) 2–3 mo post-term. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cmH₂O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). Arousal thresholds were elevated in apnoeic infants compared to control infants in both AS and QS at the term study and in QS at 2–3 mo post-term. It is concluded that a history of prematurity with neonatal apnoea has a persisting effect on decreasing arousabilty from sleep and these infants may be at increased risk for SIDS.

AB  - The effects of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy on behavioral and physiological measures of arousal were examined in a sample of 50 neonates (mean age 39.5 wks; mothers aged 18–39 yrs). After the effects of alcohol, caffeine, and maternal demographic variables were statistically controlled, regression analyses show that maternal smoking during pregnancy is predictive of higher heart rates overall and during quiet and active sleep. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is also predictive of lower heart rate variability and an increased number of tremors and changes in behavioral state. These findings suggest that maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy affects the regulation of spontaneous autonomic activity in neonates.

T2  - Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics
AB  - Reports results of the first longitudinal study of outcome correlates of parent-child bedsharing. 205 families in nonconventional and conventional family lifestyles have been followed since 1975. A target child in each family was followed from the 3rd trimester of mother's pregnancy through age 18 yrs. Bedsharing in early childhood was found to be significantly associated with increased cognitive competence measured at age 6 yrs, but the effect size was small. At age 6 yrs, bedsharing in infancy and early childhood was not associated with sleep problems, sexual pathology, or any other problematic consequences. At age 18 yrs, bedsharing in infancy and childhood was unrelated to pathology or problematic consequences, nor was it related to beneficial consequences. These results are discussed in light of widespread fears of harm caused by parent-child bedsharing. It is suggested that such fears are without warrant if bedsharing is practiced safely as part of a complex of valued and related family practices.

The assessment was made at 18 to 24 wks of pregnancy and the Ss mean age was 27 yrs. The data suggested that the withdrawn mothers had lower dopamine levels during pregnancy, and their infants had lower Brazelton scale scores. The infants of withdrawn mothers also had the highest cortisol levels and the lowest dopamine and serotonin levels as well as the most asymmetrical EEG patterns. Newborns of depressed mothers were more likely to show a greater incidence of obstetric and postnatal complications, as well as more indeterminate sleep and less optimal Brazelton habituation, orientation, motor, and depressed symptoms scores than newborns of nondepressed mothers.

AB  - Notes that besides their binding to cognate intracellular receptors gonadal steroids may also act as functional antagonists at the serotonin type 3 (5-HT₃) receptor. It is argued that steroids appear to interact allosterically with ligand-gated ion channels at the receptor membrane interface. The functional antagonism of gonadal steroids at the 5-HT₃ receptor may play a role for the development and course of nausea during pregnancy and of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 3α-reduced neuroactive steroids concurrently modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-type A receptor and regulate gene expression via the progesterone receptor after intracellular oxidation. Animal studies showed that progesterone is converted rapidly into GABAergic neuroactive steroids in vivo. It is also contended that progesterone and 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone produce a benzodiazepine-like sleep EEG profile in rats and humans. Neuroactive steroids may further be involved in the treatment of depression and anxiety with antidepressants in patients during ethanol withdrawal. It is concluded that neuroactive steroids affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions through their unique molecular properties and may constitute a yet unexploited class of drugs.

It was found that total sleep time shortened, sleep efficiency decreased, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) increased in the weeks immediately after delivery. Compared with late pregnancy, total sleep time and sleep efficiency deteriorated significantly from the delivery week to the 12th post-partum week and there was a longer period of WASO until the 11th postpartum week. The after-delivery sleep parameters estimated by the actigraph were worse than those estimated from sleep logs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The interactions of 3-month-old infants and their depressed mothers were classified as intrusive, withdrawn or good interactions. Analyses of retrospective data suggested that all depressed groups scored higher on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scales and had similarly elevated cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine during pregnancy. The depressed mothers and their newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation. Despite these group similarities, the infants of the "good interaction" mothers did not show high amounts of indeterminate sleep and they received better scores on the Brazelton scale. The more organized behaviors of these newborns may have contributed to the better interaction ratings of the "good interaction" depressed mothers.

AB  - Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities, reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function. 68 nurses (aged 22-39 yrs) completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual function, and pregnancy outcome. 53% of the women noted menstrual changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more physiological symptoms, slept approximately 1 hr less when working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep when working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork intolerance.

AB  - Examined awareness of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and risk reducing recommendations in a sample of mothers, and to examine their infant care practices. Interviews were conducted with 195 women using a standardized questionnaire. 191 questionnaires were analyzed; 134 Caucasian and 57 indigenous women. Eight had never heard of SIDS. 29 had heard of SIDS and 154 had heard of SIDS and could list risk recommendations to reduce its incidence. Multivariate analysis identified ethnicity as the only significant predictor of maternal knowledge. Indigenous mothers knew less about SIDS. Avoidance of prone sleeping was the most frequently identified recommendation (n=132), with no smoking in pregnancy (n=48) and breastfeeding (n=40) identified least frequently. There were 80.2% of mothers who put their infant in non-prone positions to sleep. Only 48 women identified smoking in pregnancy, and 93 smoking in the infant's environment as risk factors. Indigenous women were more likely to smoke in their pregnancy, bed share with their infant, and have smokers in the home. There is a high level of awareness of SIDS and the main associated risk factor of infant prone sleeping, but the link between SIDS and smoking requires further emphasis.

AB  - Women in the reproductive age group are at increased risk of unintended pregnancy, and impaired mental and physical health status early in pregnancy is linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, we examined health-related quality of life (HRQOL) indicators to assess the extent of physical and mental impairment among women by social and economic group and to identify populations that may be at higher risk. The measures in this study were constructed using 14 days or more as the cutoff value for determining the chronic presence of mental and physical health problems among women in the reproductive age group. SUDAAN software was used for analysis to account for the complex sample design. The results of this analysis show that the majority of women reported that their general health was excellent or very good (62%), more than a quarter reported that their health was good, and about 10% reported that their health was fair or poor. Data on cigarette smoking and binge drinking showed that women who currently smoked cigarettes or who reported binge drinking were more likely to report experiencing frequent mental distress, depression, and stress or anxiety. These data show that women in the reproductive age group frequently experience a substantial amount of physical and mental distress, depression, and stress or anxiety, and a high proportion of these women do not get enough rest or sleep.

T2  - Psychology and Aging
AB  - This quasi-experimental research investigates developmental regulation around a critical life-span transition, the "biological clock" for childbearing. The action-phase model of developmental regulation proposes contrasting control orientations in individuals approaching versus those having passed a developmental deadline. Individuals in an urgency phase close to the deadline should be invested in goal pursuit, whereas those who have passed the deadline without attaining the goal should focus on goal disengagement and self-protection. In 2 studies, women at different ages and with or without children were compared with regard to various indicators of primary and secondary control striving for goal attainment versus goal disengagement and self-protection. Findings support the action-phase model of developmental regulation. Patterns of control striving congruent with the participants' status as pre-versus post-deadline were associated with superior psychological well-being.

Results show that 6.3% of Ss reported IPA during the previous year. Those experiencing IPA were more likely to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HIV testing, and condom use. Ss experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance but did receive routine health care. Findings suggest that females in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for serious emotional and physical health concerns and that most are in routine contact with health care providers.

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Investigated whether state transitions in 12 low risk term fetuses (39–41 wks post menstrual age, PMA; control group) differ from those in 12 uncomplicated pregnancies >41 wks PMA (study group). All Ss underwent one behavioral study in which fetal heart rate pattern, eye and body movements were recorded simultaneously. 23 transitions from 1F to 2F (non-REM sleep to REM sleep) and 20 from 2F to 1F were recorded. Median (range) duration for transitions from 1F to 2F was 85 (10–180) sec in the study group, and 60 (10–180) sec in the control group. Transitions from 2F to 1F lasted 80 (10–140) and 60 (30–100) sec, respectively. In both groups, the fetal heart rate pattern was the 1st variable to change in transitions from 1F to 2F, however, in transitions from 2F to 1F, no specific order in change of variables could be demonstrated. It is concluded that the study of transitions does not distinguish between the term and after term fetuses under optimal conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Determined whether there is a relationship between fetal behavior and maternal anxiety during pregnancy in uncomplicated human pregnancies at 38 to 40 wks gestation. 18 pregnant nonsmoking mothers completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. After an overnight fast, each S was given a standard meal on arrival to the fetal testing unit. Each fetus was examined for 4 hrs using heart rate monitoring and real-time sonography. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body movements. Compared with fetuses of mothers with low trait anxiety scores, fetuses of mothers with relatively high trait anxiety scores spent significantly more time in quiet sleep and exhibited less gross body movement when in active sleep. Results suggest that maternal anxiety during pregnancy may have a significant effect on fetal behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Sleepless nights: The development and maintenance of night waking in infants.
AU  - Lopez, Molly Mckee
AB  - The purpose of the study was to analyze the support for a portion of the Tri-Component Model of Sleep Development. Sixty-one women in their last trimester of pregnancy completed measures assessing maternal attachment characteristics, maternal psychopathology, knowledge about infant sleep, and demographic information. Subjects were contacted again 5 1/2 months after their infant's birth and asked to provide information about their pregnancy, labor and delivery, and child's medical history. They also completed measures of infant temperament, knowledge about infant sleep, impact of life events, and selected parenting behaviors. Subjects also completed a 1-week sleep diary, monitoring their infants sleep schedule during the night, and a rating of the problematic nature of their infant's sleep. Analyses supported the proposed path in which knowledge about infant sleep prior to the infant's birth had an indirect effect on infant sleep disruption through its relation with problematic parental bedtime behaviors, such as cosleeping and nighttime feedings. Significant indirect effects of infant fussy temperament and maternal anxious/ambivalent attachment on parental bedtime behaviors were not found. An additional model positing relations between infant gender and unadaptability with sleep disruption and an indirect effect of knowledge of infant sleep on sleep disruption through its relation with parental bedtime behaviors was supported in exploratory analyses.

TI  - How to help parents on young children: The Touchpoints model.
AU  - Brazelton, T. Berry
T2  - Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry
AB  - Presents the Touchpoints' model for parenting of young children. Touchpoints are periods during the first three years of life during which children's spurts in development result in pronounced disruption in the family system. Touchpoints are seen as a map of child development that can be identified and anticipated by both parents and providers. Thirteen touchpoints have been noted in the first three years, beginning in pregnancy. They are centered around caregiving themes that truly matter to parents (e.g., feeding, discipline), rather than traditional milestones. Awareness of these touchpoints and strategies of dealing with them can help reduce negative patterns that might otherwise result in problems in the areas of sleep, feeding, toilet training, etc. The guiding principles of the Touchpoints model are presented, as well as parent and practitioner assumptions. It is concluded that the Touchpoints ' framework can be seen as a foundation for how individuals and their systems can enhance their care for families.

AU  - Refinetti, Roberto
T2  - Behavior Genetics
AB  - Studied the role of the period of the environmental cycle during gestation and infancy on the circadian period of adult hamsters. Tau-mutant hamsters of all 3 genotypes (+/+, 24-hr circadian period; +/tau, 22-hr period; tau/tau, 20-hr period) were conceived and raised under either a 20-hr light–dark cycle or a 24-hr cycle. The circadian period in constant darkness was determined at 2 mo of age by inspection of records of running- wheel activity. Differences in circadian period of up to 1.2 hrs were observed. However, changes of the same magnitude were also observed in animals conceived and raised under a 24-hr cycle and exposed to a 20-hr cycle at 8 mo of age. Therefore, it is concluded that the aftereffects of entrainment can account for the apparent influence of the early environment. The free-running period of the circadian pacemaker seems to be under complete genetic control and not to be influenced by the period of the environmental cycle under which the animal is raised.

Benefits from participating in a singing group for 2 hrs a week included emotional expression, tension relief, and a powerful group solidarity. As the women clapped and tapped musical rhythms with their hands and feet, learning folk songs and lullabies, their babies seemed to be joining in their fun. Two older mothers (aged 39 and 42 yrs old) who were scheduled for Caesareans gave birth spontaneously and confidently. After their babies were born, the mothers who had sung to their unborn infants found themselves more proficient at calming their newborns to sleep, and they were able to continue to breastfeed longer.

AB  - Used a transmitter implanted into the abdominal cavity of a small pregnant rodent to simultaneously measure the heart rate, core body temperature, and general locomotory activity. Using this method, the heart rate of a female Mongolian gerbil decreased from a mean of 303 beats per minute during gravidity to a level of 248 beats per minute during lactation. At the same time, the core body temperature increased from 37.7°C to 38.0°C. During pregnancy, the general locomotory activity of this female followed the normal nocturnal pattern for this species, but there was an overall reduction in activity to 85% of the nonpregnant state. The level of activity was further reduced during lactation to about 43% of the nonpregnant state, which was largely the result of less activity during the dark.

AB  - Examined the prevalence and sources of midsleep awakenings in women prior to conception and during each trimester of pregnancy. Data were obtained from a larger study evaluating sleep patterns in women throughout the childbearing period (K. A. Lee et al, 1994). 25 women (mean age 31.24 yrs) completed sleep diary entries for 2 consecutive nights from each of the following 4 time periods: pre-conception, 1st trimester, 2nd trimester, and 3rd trimester. Results show a twofold increase in the number of awakenings from pre-conception to the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.  The predominant source of awakening during the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy was due to the need to urinate. Findings indicate that maintenance insomnia during pregnancy follows a pattern of prevalence that can be characterized by trimester and that parity and environmental circumstances can influence sources of awakenings. Implications for nurses working with childbearing women are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of stimulus intensity on heart rate response in 18 low-risk human fetuses between 37 and 40 weeks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated in quiet sleep with a 30-s voice sound at intensities of 80 dB and 90 dB. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal-processing techniques. We found that fetuses generally exhibited a 5- to 10-s decrease in heart rate following stimulus onset at an intensity of 80 dB. The response pattern changed from deceleratory to acceleratory when stimulus intensity was increased to 90 dB. Our findings suggest that a heart rate deceleration at low-stimulus intensity may be a component of the orienting reflex in the human fetus.

TI  - Fetal brain behavior and cognitive development.
AU  - Joseph, R.
T2  - Developmental Review
AB  - The human brainstem is fashioned around the 6th–7th wk of gestation, forming the medulla, pons, and midbrain. By the 7th–9th gestational wk the fetus displays spontaneous movements, 1 wk later takes its first "breath," and by the 25th wk demonstrates stimulus-induced heart rate accelerations. As the pons, which is later to mature, mediates arousal, body movements, and vestibular and vibroacoustic perception, from around the 20th–27th wks the fetus responds with arousal and body movements to vibroacoustic and loud sounds delivered to the maternal abdomen. The midbrain inferior-auditory colliculus followed by the superior-visual colliculus is the last to mature and in conjunction with the lower brainstem makes fine auditory discriminations and reacts to sound with fetal heart rate (FHR) accelerations, head turning, and eye movements—around the 36th wk. When aroused the fetus also reacts with reflexive movements, head turning, FHR accelerations, and may fall asleep and display rapid eye movements. Thus fetal cognitive motor activity, including auditory discrimination, orienting, the wake–sleep cycle, FHRs, and defensive reactions, appear to be under the reflexive control of the brainstem, which also appears capable of learning-related activity.

AB  - The last decade has seen an increased interest in the role oestrogens for the maintenance of psychological well-being. Episodes of change in oestrogen levels are high-risk periods for the emergence of psychological symptoms in some women. This may be due to a "kindling effect" for women with previous psychological disturbance, an effect on circadian rhythm activity and altered neurovegetative functions, or an effect on central rhythmic functioning between the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex, all mediated by effects on neurotransmitter systems. Data supporting these hypotheses come from animal studies as well as research on the psychological side-effects of oral contraceptives, the study of mood and cognitive disturbances related to the menstrual cycle, the studies of states of hormonal change such as pregnancy and the menopause and, of course, studies of women with psychiatric disorders such as major depression, seasonal affective disorder, and dementia. Current data support a relationship between oestrogen and psychological well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Discusses special considerations in the evaluation and treatment of depression in women. The prevalence of depressive disorders in women is twice that in men. This gender difference emerges around the time of puberty and persists through the childbearing years. Reproductive events and psychosocial factors are important influences on depression in women. Women often present with atypical depressive symptoms and comorbid disorders that can complicate both diagnosis and treatment. Sex differences in pharmacokinetics have been noted, as well as differences in antidepressant treatment response. While sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain may be part of the constellation of depressive symptoms, they are also important considerations in selecting a treatment option for depressed women.

AB  - Recorded fetal heart rate and fetal eye and gross body movements in 85 normal human fetuses (aged 37–41 wks gestation) for a total of 9,135 mins. As percent of periods of no coincidence (PNCs) increased, (1) the frequency of state changes increase; (2) the time spent in active sleep decreased; and (3) the number Ss entering an awake state decreased. Percent PNC was independent of the length of time spent in quiet sleep. Results suggest that extended PNC may result from disruption of homeostatic control mechanisms during active sleep.

TI  - A longitudinal study of cognitive performance during pregnancy and new motherhood.
AU  - Casey, Paul
T2  - Archives of Women's Mental Health
AB  - This longitudinal study examined the popular belief that cognitive performance is impaired during pregnancy. Both self-report and objective test data on cognitive performance were collected on six occasions from three groups of women at three monthly intervals. Ten women who initially planned a pregnancy, 18 women initially in the first trimester of pregnancy, and 24 non pregnant controls completed the study. At each data collection participants reported their perceptions of current everyday memory, sleep, health, exercise, depression, anxiety and stress levels, and undertook a set of cognitive tests examining vocabulary, reasoning, short term memory, working memory, and semantic memory. A personality test was taken once. The planning group showed a significant increase in reported forgetting during pregnancy, and significantly more variability in sleep patterns than the control group over the test period. The personality factor of conscientiousness and level of reported anxiety were significant predictors of reported absentmindedness and forgetting on errands. The reported increase in forgetting in some pregnant women is possibly related to a complex interaction of personality and particular life situations.

TI  - The effect of maternal emotion on fetal behavior.
AU  - Masakowski, Yvonne R.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of maternal emotion on fetal behavior. 32 nulliparous pregnant women (36-40 weeks gestation) were presented with three 30s film segments depicting breastfeeding, nature and labor scenes. Film segments were presented during the first period of low fetal heart rate variability, the fetal analog of quiet sleep. Maternal heart rate, blood pressure and respiration were recorded, as well as fetal heart rate, body movements and breathing movements. The breastfeeding film segment elicited a significant decrease in maternal blood pressure (- mm Hg, p<0.05) and a significant increase in maternal respiration rate (3.2, p<0.01). Concomitant with maternal physiological changes, there was a marginally significant increase in fetal heart rate (1.14 bpm, p<0.05) and a significant increase in fetal breathing movements, (3.5 breaths/minute, p<0.01), during the second 10s of the breastfeeding film. Fetal heart rates increased in association with an increase in maternal respiration rate, a decrease in breath amplitude and a decrease in blood pressure. Physiological changes associated with maternal emotions exert an influence on fetal behavior which may have consequences for neonatal development.

Pregnancy can pose a risk for developing sleep-disordered breathing, back pain, and leg cramps. It can trigger episodes of sleepwalking and periodic leg movements. Sleep disturbance during pregnancy also can be associated with frightening dreams, postpartum blues, and sometimes major depression and postnatal psychosis.

The Concise Guides are meant to complement the more detailed information to be found in lengthier psychiatry texts.  The authors discuss classification issues, with a focus on a symptom approach to the recognition of sleep problems. The reader is given basic information necessary to understand sleep: sleep architecture, sleep patterns, and sleep physiology and neurophysiology. The authors then turn their attention to a systematic discussion of 3 major categories of sleep disorders: transient and chronic insomnias, excessive sleepiness disorders, and parasomnias. The book is then concluded by describing 3 special populations who frequently have sleep problems: children, elderly people, and pregnant women.

AB  - Examined reasons women received no prenatal care, as well as changes in health behaviors to ensure positive neonatal outcomes and actual neonatal outcomes. The following questions were proposed: (1) What are the reasons reported by women for not receiving prenatal care? (2) What health behaviors did the women change to ensure a healthy baby? (3) What are the perceived and actual outcomes for the neonates whose mothers received no prenatal care? 12 urban New Mexican women who received no prenatal care were interviewed regarding their reasons for not receiving care during pregnancy, health behaviors, and perceived neonatal outcomes. Data on actual neonatal outcomes were taken from the medical record. Maternal reasons for no prenatal care were socio-demographic, system related, attitudinal, and outside forces of job and childcare. To ensure a healthy baby, the women made changes in their nutrition, self-care activities, substance use, sleep, and exercise activities. All of the women perceived they had a healthy baby. Yet 61% of the neonates had complications and 45% were low birth weight. The research findings were used to develop a care management program that included case management and utilization management.

AB  - Determined whether psychiatric morbidity in the 8th mo of pregnancy, as detected by a brief psychiatric screening questionnaire, predicted postnatal mental disorder. 500 women in their 8th mo of pregnancy were screened using the Shona Symptom Questionnaire. Based on their scores, 95 Ss were placed in a high risk group and 110 were placed in a low risk group. All Ss in the high risk group and a random sample of the low risk group were reviewed at 6–8 wks postpartum using the Shona version of the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule. 46% of the high risk Ss became cases, while only 9% of the low risk Ss did. The association was even stronger after adjustment for age, marital status, and occupation. The predictive accuracy of the Shona Symptom Questionnaire was: sensitivity 81.5%; specificity 66%; positive predictive value 46%; and negative predictive value 91%. Anxiety, worry, depression, fatigue, and sleep problems were the most common symptoms being reported by over 90% of cases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Pain Management Nursing
AB  - Pain management for premature infants raises challenging questions for nurses. This group of infants is often physiologically fragile and they may undergo frequent painful procedures on a daily basis. Contrary to ideas from the past, premature infants are able to feel pain, and nervous system elements required for the transmission of painful stimuli are functional by 24 weeks gestation. Painful procedures are harmful to the infant's physiological stability and the ability to self-regulate, which includes maintenance of motor control and stable sleep/wake cycles. Assessment of pain in the premature infant is complex. Major indicators of pain include facial grimaces and physiological parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) is one tool designed specifically for preterm infants. Nonpharmacological nursing measures such as swaddling or nesting and offering a pacifier are useful strategies to help infants cope with painful procedures. The nurse may also maintain a therapeutic environment to assist the infant in self-regulation. Pharmacological agents such as morphine, fentanyl, and acetaminophen are effective in relieving procedural pain. The use of oral sucrose before and during painful procedures offers new possibilities for pain relief. Recent research shows that oral sucrose is a safe and effective analgesic for short-term procedures. Research studies to determine the most effective doses and modes of oral sucrose administration are ongoing. It is thought that the relief of pain is owing to the sweet taste of the sucrose that activates endogenous pain-modulating systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This review describes the recently approved nonbenzodiazepine sleep agent, zaleplon. Studies of zaleplon were identified through a search of English-language articles listed in MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, with no limitation on year. These were supplemented by educational materials from conferences. The efficacy and tolerability of zaleplon have been documented in the literature. Zaleplon has been shown to improve sleep variables in comparison with placebo. Like most hypnotic agents, zaleplon can be used for problems of sleep initiation at the beginning of the night, but its short duration of clinical effect may also allow patients to take it later in the night without residual effects the next morning. Zaleplon can be taken ≤ 2 hrs before awakening without hangover effects. It is generally well tolerated, with headache being the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials (15%–18%). Compared with flurazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, zaleplon causes significantly less psychomotor and cognitive impairment. Zaleplon has not been studied in pregnant women or children. The dose of zaleplon should be individualized; the recommended daily dose for most adults is 10 mg.

T2  - Biological Rhythm Research
AB  - One family group of 1 male and 1 female common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) was observed in captivity under natural environmental conditions to describe the circadian pattern of grooming behavior during pregnancy of the reproductive female. Animals were observed by focal sampling during the active phase, during 2 non-consecutive days per week, from August–November 1996. The duration of self and social grooming of each animal were totaled each hour. The time series obtained were analyzed by cluster analysis and single cosinor analysis. The daily patterns of grooming behavior during pregnancy were divided by cluster analysis into 2 stages, one corresponding to the 2nd half of the 3rd month of pregnancy, and the other from the last half of the 3rd month to the last week before parturition. The confidence intervals of acrophases overlapped in all stages. The acrophases values of the first stage occurred between 10:09 hr and 11:00 hr, and on the second stage between 8:51 hr and 11:13 hr. The daily pattern of grooming behavior of adult males and females showed a tendency to increase in the first hours of the active phase. This trend to advance grooming behavior during the second stage of pregnancy may be due to the coming parturition itself or seasonal influences.

AB  - Pregnancy and the reproductive cycle were monitored in 13 captive southern white rhinoceros by measuring progesterone metabolites in fecal extracts and by observing behavior patterns. Fecal hormones were measured using a monoclonal antibody produced against 4-pregnen-11-o1-3,20-dione hemisuccinate:BSA. Several Ss exhibited flat or erratic endocrine profiles, but evidence was found for 17 reproductive cycles in 5 females. Mating behavior coincided with nadirs in pregnane concentrations. These cycles appeared to fall into 2 general categories: those of approximately 1 mo in duration and those lasting approximately 2 mo. Interluteal phase lengths were similar for the 2 cycle types, but Type II cycles were characterized by extended luteal phases lasting more than twice as long as Type I luteal phases. Because Type I cycles predominated and because evidence suggests that some Type II cycles may be aberrant, it is argued that these approximately monthly cycles represent the typical reproductive cycle for this species. Three females became pregnant during the course of the study. The authors were able to detect pregnancy by approximately 3 mo post-breeding, as indicated by sustained pregnane concentrations markedly higher than nonpregnant luteal phase concentrations.

AB  - Examined the relationship between behavioral state and the cardiac orienting reflex in 75 human fetuses between 36–40 wks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated with a 30-sec speech sound at an average intensity of 83 dB SPL in quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS). The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on heart rate (HR) pattern and the presence or absence of eye and general body movements. A significant HR deceleration occurred, in both QS and AS, following stimulus onset. However, HR decelerations occurred more often in QS than AS; and for fetuses exhibiting a HR deceleration, the magnitude of the deceleration was greater in AS vs QS. In AS, female fetuses exhibited a larger, more sustained HR deceleratory response than male fetuses. Based on these results, it is concluded that behavioral state is an important determinant of the HR deceleratory response in human fetuses.

AB  - Determined whether a novel quantitative measure of EEG activity, derived for the analysis of state dependent electrocortical activity in the fetal baboon, would discriminate neurologist-coded EEG patterns in the human preterm infant and whether this measure of EEG activity would vary as a function of behaviorally coded sleep states. 10 preterm infants (28–32 wks gestation at birth) were studied at 34–36 wks post conceptional age. Behavioral states were coded by a trained observer at 1-min intervals and EEG activity was recorded and was coded by a pediatric neurologist. Results show that the analytic method previously developed in fetal baboons for identifying EEG segments with and without Tracé-alternant (periods in which there are bursts of high-voltage slow wave activity in the EEG that alternate with periods of low-voltage activity) successfully distinguishes homologous patterns of EEG activity in preterm infants. The method provides an excellent objective approach for monitoring changes in EEG patterns that are coincident with behaviorally defined sleep states.

TI  - When does gender matter? Explaining the transition to adulthood as a gendered process. (feminist theory).
AU  - Mahaffy, Kimberly Autumn
AB  - Most gender theory and research focuses on two points in the life course: childhood and middle adulthood. Less attention is given to the period in between. The purpose of this dissertation is to determine whether and how the transition to adulthood is gendered. To what extent do school, family, and labor market contexts have a different effect on adolescent girls and boys as they become adults? Using data from the High School and Beyond 1980 Sophomore Cohort Study (1980-1992), 1 examine how social context differentially affects the plans for the future and adult status outcomes of young women and men. The adult status outcomes are union formation, becoming a parent, achieving residential independence, educational attainment, and occupational status attainment. I also determine whether self-esteem in adolescence has a different effect on these outcomes. I use probit, ordered probit, ordinary least squares, and two stage least squares regression. My findings indicate that some aspects of the transition to adulthood are gendered. However, the differential effects of social context and other factors are not as numerous or as consistent as we would expect based on the premise of gender theory that gender is a pervasive, organizing framework embedded in all social processes and institutions. I find that adolescent girls' expected timing of childbearing and socioeconomic plans are not interdependent. This was true for adolescent boys as well. A significant relation between the expected timing of marriage and childbearing indicates that adolescent girls are cognizant of their "biological clock" and expect to bear a child sooner than adolescent boys when both plan to delay marriage. I also find that school context is more likely to have a different effect on women's and men's socio-economic outcomes whereas family context is more likely to gender family formation outcomes. I conclude that self-esteem in adolescence is relatively unimportant to adult outcomes. To make sense of these findings, I articulate a theory of the transition to adulthood as a gendered process by explaining the occasions when gender influenced the process as well as when it did not.

When evaluation of parental preference was made by parents, mothers' favorites had learned to speak earlier, were more often the psychic leader of the pair, more often had sleeping difficulties and other psychosomatic symptoms in adolescence, and most often scored in class 2-3, nonspecific neurotic symptoms, on the PSE. Fathers' favorites were more often the physical leaders of the pair, showed less accident proneness, and most often reported tendencies toward autonomy from their co-twins. The fewest psychosomatic symptoms were seen in twins in the intermediate position regarding parental preference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Determined the degree of consistency in behavioral state organization for 30 low-risk human participants examined as fetuses at 38–40 wks gestation and again as neonates at approximately 2 wks postnatal age. Behavioral states were assigned similarly for fetuses and neonates in terms of heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body movements. Results show that as a group, fetuses and neonates spent virtually identical proportions of a sleep period in quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS), and indeterminate states. However, the only within-subject consistency between the fetal and neonatal periods was in the duration of complete QS epochs. Fetuses made fewer transitions between QS and AS, but neonates had shorter and more structured AS to QS transitions. These findings suggest that, whereas CNS processes governing QS do not change appreciably, the control of AS undergoes significant changes in the 4 wks spanning the fetal and neonatal periods. It is suggested that the duration of enclosed QS epochs provides the only stable measure of behavioral state development between the prenatal and postnatal periods.

TI  - Changes in sleep patterns of young women from late pregnancy to postpartum: Relationships to their infants' movements.

T2  - Perceptual and Motor Skills
AB  - Examined the changes in the sleep patterns of 10 23–31 yr olds from late pregnancy (36 wks) to the 6th postpartum week, focusing on the relationship between the mothers' sleep patterns and their infants' movements. The mothers' polyomnograms and their infants' ankle actigrams were simultaneously recorded at home in 3 sessions, during the 1st, 3rd, and 6th postpartum weeks. Analysis of the 8 mothers who adapted well to the postpartum period show that wake time after sleep onset increased significantly during the postpartum period vs late pregnancy. Results indicate a high synchronization between infants' movements and mothers' wakefulness. Eight mothers did not complain of sleep disturbance, while the 2 mothers who had difficulty with their infants did. It is suggested that mothers who can tolerate sleep interruption arising from feeding and maintain their Stages 3 + 4 and REM should not be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance. Mothers who have difficulty with their infants and complain of sleep disturbance should be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined changes in the behavioral and hormonal patterns of cooperatively breeding pairs in pygmy marmosets (PGMs) with the passing of time and with specific reproductive events. The authors (1) compared patterns of sexual (SB), agonistic, and affiliative behavior of newly paired PGMs with the same behavioral patterns immediately after the birth of their 1st set of infants; (2) determined if postpartum behavioral differences existed between pairs whose infants lived and those whose infants died; and (3) examined whether behavioral patterns changed over the course of ovarian cycles in parous PGMs as had been documented in nulliparous pairs. Males consistently altered their SB and olfactory monitoring of mates during periovulatory periods in the females' cycles both postpairing and postpartum, while similar rates of social and sexual behavior were maintained between the conditions. SB occurred throughout the females' ovarian cycles. Peaks in SB during the periovulatory period in nulliparous pairs disappeared after the birth of infants. Pairs whose infants died showed higher rates of SB than pairs with surviving infants. Social and SB may function to maintain the relationship both during and outside of ovulation, especially with the loss of infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tested the efficacy of critically timed sleep deprivation in major mood disorders (MMD) occurring during pregnancy and postpartum. Nine women who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for an MMD with onset during pregnancy or within 1 yr postpartum underwent a trial of either early-night sleep deprivation (ESD), in which they were sleep deprived in the early part of one night and slept from 03:00-07:00 h, or late-night sleep deprivation (LSD), in which they were deprived of sleep in the latter part of one night and slept from 21:00-01:00 h. Mood was assessed before the night of sleep deprivation, after the night of sleep deprivation, and after a night of recovery sleep by trained clinicians, blind to treatment condition, using standardized scales. More patients responded to LSD compared with ESD and they responded more after a night of recovery sleep than after a night of sleep deprivation. Pregnant women were the only responders to ESD and the only nonresponders to LSD. The results suggest that, critically timed sleep deprivation interventions may benefit women with pregnancy or postpartum major mood disorders and potentially provide a viable alternative treatment modality for those women who are not candidates for pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic interventions.

AB  - Determined the effects of external light stimulation on fetal behavioral states and the difference from those of vibroacoustic stimulation. A flashlight and a vibroacoustic stimulator was applied directly on the maternal abdomen to determine the response of 56 normal fetuses at 36-40 weeks gestation. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and body movements were recorded using an actocardiograph, and fetal eye movements were observed using real-time ultrasonography. Using Nijhuis's criteria, the fetal behavioral states (1F-4F) were determined. FHR acceleration was considered a fetal response to the stimulations. The lag time between stimulation and fetal response was within 4 s. A positive response rate to the light stimulation was higher at behavioral states 2F (82%) and 3F (83%) than at state 1F (4%). Light stimulation changed the behavioral state of two of the six 3F fetuses (33%) from 3F to 4F. No change of state was observed in fetuses that were in states IF and 2F. For vibroacoustic stimulation, fetal response was 100% positive and changes of states were observed frequently irrespective of the behavioral state before the stimulation. Fetal response to light stimulation is closely connected to fetal behavioral states and may reflect some distinct stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.

TI  - The hospitalized preterm labor patient: Perceptions of stressors, supports, and other psychological factors.
AU  - Graf, Ronald A.
AB  - A descriptive design was used to explore the psychological aspects of the antepartal hospitalization experience for preterm labor patients. Patient's perceptions of stressors and supports during hospitalization were assessed. A convenience sample of 30 multigravida women were used for the study sample. Patients hospitalized a minimum of four days or more participated in a semi-structured interview to assess their perceptions. A modified Sarason Life Experience Survey (LES) and a Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS), was administered following the interviews. Quantitative methods for analysis of the demographic, LES, and JCS data were done using descriptive statistics. Qualitative analysis of the audiotaped interviews were performed using the naturalistic paradigm. These hospitalized women reported people, events and issues as stressors. Critical areas identified were: environmental confinement, difficulty in interpersonal communications, loss of control, isolation and loss of the parental role. The primary means of support reported by these hospitalized women were people. Interactions and relationships that these women had with their immediate family and friends provided this support. Care given by the nurses and doctors in stabilizing the patient's medical condition and maintaining the pregnancy was critical. A greater number of negative life events than positive were identified in these women. Negative life events with the greatest impact were: change in sleep habits, recreation, other events, and social activities. Coping styles utilized and found most effective were Supportant, Optimistic, and Confrontive. Coping styles used less and found least effective were Fatalistic, Evasive, and Emotive. The relationships between stressful life events and coping styles used during hospitalization demonstrated that not all subjects utilized multiple support systems along with problem solving behaviors to cope with the stress of hospitalization. Younger women reported more stressfu (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Developmental Psychobiology
AB  - Operant responding on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for intravenous cocaine as well as sucrose reinforcement was examined in female rats throughout the reproductive process. Self-administration sessions began before mating, and continued throughout pregnancy and until lactational Day 8; following parturition, litters were present with dams during operant sessions. Physiological changes associated with the reproductive process dramatically altered PR responding for cocaine, while PR responding for sucrose was relatively stable throughout pregnancy and lactation. Female animals exhibited the highest number of responses/session for cocaine during estrus and the 1st trimester of pregnancy and the lowest responding near parturition, with levels only partially recovering during lactation. Dams self-administering cocaine exhibited notably different patterns of maternal behavior in the operant chambers than dams responding for sucrose. Thus, cocaine's reinforcing efficacy may be influenced by (a) the changing physiological profile associated with the reproductive process and (b) competition from the reinforcing properties of offspring during lactation.

AB  - Assessed the effects of discontinuing coffee ingestion (common in toddlers in Guatemala) on cognitive development and sleep patterns in 132 iron-deficient 12–24 mo olds who had received coffee for >2 mo. Children were stratified by hemoglobin and randomly assigned to an experimental (sugar and coloring substitute), or control group (continuation of coffee). Anemic children received iron supplements for 2–3 mo. After 5 mo, testers evaluated children with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, including scales from the Behavior Rating Scales (BRS). Sleep was assessed on the 1st visit and every 2 wks. There were no significant effects of treatment on test scores or BRS ratings. In the 24 hr period reported on at the final visit, experimental children slept more during the night and overall, a difference not found at the 1st visit. There were no differences in sleep difficulty or waking at night. Women's coffee intake during pregnancy was associated with lower BRS ratings. The effects of postnatal coffee ingestion in Guatemala were seen for sleep duration, but not for cognitive development. Prenatal coffee ingestion was negatively associated with the BRS.

T2  - Cerebral Cortex
AB  - Examined the processes of cortical activation and deactivation of the fetal sheep brain during spontaneous sleep transitions and during central nervous processing of vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) through the nonlinear analysis of electrocorticograms (ECoGs). ECoGs were collected of 7 fetal sheep at 133–141 days of gestation before and during VAS from the maternal abdominal surface, with data analyzed according to an algorithm to estimate the predictability of the ECoG in its time course by means of a point prediction error (PPE). Results show deterministic and nonlinear portions in fetal ECoGs. PPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. VAS in NREM sleep resulted in an abrupt increase of the PPE, not reaching the level of REM sleep. The steep increase of the PPE at onset and its slow decrease after cessation of VAS were very similar to the dymanics of spontaneous sleep state transitions, suggesting the involvement of the same cortical activating mechanisms. It is concluded that the stage and the time course of fetal brain activation and deactivation patterns can be clearly shown by PPE techniques, a method that complements linear analysis methodology.

AB  - Studied sleep disorders in 16-year-old children and adolescents in Hunan province in a 2-stage epidemiological survey, in 1990. Human subjects were 4,596 male and 4,048 female Chinese preschool, school-age children, and adolescents (aged 4–16 yrs) from 6 areas of Hunan province, 5,513 from urban areas and 3,131 from rural areas. Ss' mental health status were investigated by parents and teachers with a mental problem screening scale; and Ss with positive symptoms of sleep problems were further tested for sleep disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R). Parents of 117 Ss with sleep disorders and 110 normal Ss completed a scale investigating the factors of family economics and culture, maternal diseases in mother's pregnancy, abnormality in mother's childbirth, child's brain injury and serious diseases after birth, developmental delays, family mental illness history, and child rearing problems. Prevalent rate of sleep disorders was studied in 4 age groups, by living areas, and by sex. Sleep disorders accompanied with other problems, such as enuresis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mental retardation, emotional disorders, and stuttering were studied; and the risk factors were analyzed using regression analysis. Child sleep disorders mainly presenting as nightmares and sleep terror and key-risk psychosocial factors were discussed.

AB  - Evaluate the influence of biological and historical and clinical factors on the different aspect of sleep behavior and disturbances evaluated by the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC). Mothers of 1,157 children (aged 6.5–15.3 yrs) completed the SDSC together with a questionnaire on demographic data about family composition, parent's education and professional activities, as well as clinical data about pregnancy, delivery and medical history of the child with specific questions regarding pathologies that could affect sleep; sleep habits of parents and children were also investigated. Global sleep disturbances measured as SDSC total score were affected by cosleeping, early sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis, asthma and parents' sleep disorders. Early sleep disorders, asthma and parents' sleep disorders had a significant main effect on disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Results underline the role of genetic and neurobiological substrate on the development of children sleep, delineating the areas of the sleep that are involved and rising some suggestions on which factors could lead to different later sleep disturbances.

AB  - Investigated the effects of an intervention for polydrug-using adolescent mothers. 126 mothers (aged 16–21 yrs) who had not completed high school and who had or had not used drugs during pregnancy participated. The program included educational, vocational, and parenting classes; social and drug rehab; and day care for their infants while they attended school half-day. Drug-exposed infants were similar to the nonexposed infants on traditional birth measures, although they had inferior Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale scores. Drug-exposed infants also spent less time in quiet sleep and more time crying and showing stress behaviors. Both the mothers and the infants in the drug groups demonstrated inferior interactions, and their dopamine and serotonin levels were significantly higher. As early as 3 mo (following 3 mo of intervention), the drug rehab mothers and their infants looked more like the nondrug group in their interactions; by 6 mo, they looked similar on virtually every measure. At 12 mo, the infants of drug rehab mothers had superior Early Social Communication Scale scores and Bayley Mental scale scores, as well as significantly greater head circumference and fewer pediatric complications. Drug rehab mothers also improved on several lifestyle variables. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared ultrasound behavioral recordings of 18 low-risk fetuses of at least 37 completed weeks gestation and recordings of the same variables at 3–5 days postnatally. Comparison of the frequency of eye, limb, and body movements revealed that the fetal states 1F and 2F were comparable to quiet sleep (Sl) and REM sleep (S2). The heart rate in each of the 3 states in the fetus was about 20 beats per min higher than in the corresponding post-natal (PN) state, although the states were similar. States 1F and 2F accounted for a higher observation of the fetus than states S1 and S2 in the neonatal observations. State S3 (quiet awake) always and only occurred in the PN observations in association with feeding. Movements observed in S5 (crying) were not significantly different from 2F.

The literature suggests both acute and possible long-term sequelae of in utero COC exposure. There may be moderate to severe developmental sequelae secondary to structural malformations in the CNS and to perinatal conditions presenting risk to the CNS. There may also be transient and long-term problems in more subtle dimensions of developmental functioning, such as motor skills or language development. Difficulties with behavioral regulation may manifest as irritability, sleep, and feeding problems, and difficult temperament in the young infant.

AB  - Recorded Doppler velocity waveforms from atrioventricular valves in the hearts of 20 healthy human fetuses at 36–38 wks of gestation during 2 behavioral states: 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep). Behavioral states were identified by simultaneous recording of fetal heart rate, gross body movements, and eye movements. No significant changes were found in the ratios between the velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active ventricular filling at the level of mitral and tricuspid valves when measurements obtained during 1F and 2F were compared. During 2F, left ventricular output increased and right ventricular output decreased, resulting in a marked modification of the right to left cardiac output ratio. Data suggest that behavioral states influence fetal cardiac hemodynamics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics
AB  - Fetal lambs in 9 ewes were prepared for chronic intrauterine recording of behavioral states and breathing movements during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Pilocarpine (0.5, 1, 2, 4, mg iv) administered directly to the fetus produced an immediate change from quiet sleep to arousal and a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of fetal breathing movements. These effects on behavioral states and breathing movements were blocked by atropine sulfate but not by methylatropine. It is concluded that the increased incidence of breathing movements are due, in part, to increased arousal at the expense of quiet sleep. The fetus alternates between arousal and REM sleep, which results in sustained breathing movements. These effects of pilocarpine are mediated primarily via central muscarinic sites of action.

AB  - Reviews the development of circadian rhythms and the neuronal mechanisms underlying their generation (particularly the suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN] of the hypothalamus). Based on perinatal animal studies and data from human fetuses and/or preterm infants it was concluded that although human circadian rhythms are present as early as 29 wks of gestation, maternal circadian rhythms (generated by the mother's SCN) are important for the optimal functioning of the endogenous fetal biological clock. The significance of environmental cues for entrainment is also discussed; a longer duration of exposure to the cyclic environment (including light–dark cycle and periodic maternal care) leads to earlier entrainment in infants as young as 35 wks of conceptional age.

Women who were psychiatrically asymptomatic for at least 1 yr, and who had an absence of known psychological risk factors were used in this sample. 34 Ss (mean age of 28.8 yrs) participated. It was hypothesized that disrupted sleep would precede the onset of affective dysregulation in Ss with a lifetime history of depression during the childbearing period. All-night EEG sleep recordings were obtained in Ss' homes. The sleep systems of Ss with a history of depression were more fragile and showed some of the stigmata of depression, even in the absence of mood disturbance. This supports the association between sleep abnormalities and vulnerability to mood disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sleep problems can tear a family apart. Basing her work on more than ten years' experience in the baby clinic of a family medical practice and the Tavistock Clinic, London, Dilys Daws looks beyond the symptom of sleep disturbance in babies to the underlying family dynamics. Her form of brief psychoanalytic therapy, which is proving to be very successful, combines attention to the individual baby's daily patterns, the parents' memories of the pregnancy and birth and their thoughts about their relationship with each other. Daws offers a space for linking the meaning of not sleeping to deeper problems of separation and individuation between mother and baby, and illustrates her work with rich clinical vignettes. The book is not only theoretically illuminating but will be of practical help to professionals and parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Pregnant rats were subjected to immobilization, unavoidable electric foot shocks, REM sleep deprivation, or immersion in cold water. During adulthood, male offspring were tested for feminine (FSB) and masculine sexual behavior (MSB). Immobilization induced an impairment of MSB and a facilitation of FSB. Electric shocks showed only minor differences in MSB when compared with intact controls, and no signs of lordosis behavior were observed. The REM deprivation group displayed a major impairment of MSB, even greater than that observed within the immobilization group. However, lordosis behavior was only induced with estradiol. Water immersion seemed to have a facilitatory effect on several parameters of MSB; Ss did not show lordosis behavior even with hormonal treatment. Changes in sex behavior induced by prenatal stress seem to be linked to the nature of the stressor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated changes in sleep quality during pregnancy, using the sleep EEG, in 9 healthy women on 2 consecutive nights during each trimester of pregnancy. Waking after sleep onset increased from the 2nd (TR2) to the 3rd (TR3) trimester, whereas REM sleep decreased from the 1st trimester (TR1) to TR2. Spectral analysis of the EEG in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep revealed a progressive reduction of power density in the course of pregnancy. In REM sleep, the spindle frequency range was not affected, and a minor reduction of power density in some frequency bins below 12 Hz was present only in TR3. Results document major alterations of the pregnancy sleep EEG that are not evident from the sleep scores and that may be associated with pregnancy hormonal changes. Findings confirm the need to complement sleep recordings with analysis of the EEG. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This book covers the history of dream interpretation, not only in Europe, but also in Asia, Africa, and ancient America. It shows and documents that the workings of the dynamic unconscious on dreams was not the discovery of Freud, but that the ancient Kemetic Egyptians of 3000 BC knew of it and used it in therapy and religious practices. [This book] explores . . . the profound influence of family life and family consciousness on dream dynamics and material.  Along with chapters on modern dream studies, author Bruce Bynum explores dreams and the clinical problems associated with sleep; various kinds of unusual or anomalous dreams that include precognitive, telepathic, and psychokinetic dreams . . . ; family dreams and family dynamics that are associated with ACOA [adult children of alcoholics] families; and pregnancy and family dreams. The last section of the book explores the further reaches of dreaming in family life—dreams and healing, lucid dreaming, dreams and death, and how an understanding of dreams, both ancient and contemporary, deepens our insight into philosophy and life.

Offspring temperatures were measured at 0, 60, and 120 min away from the nest on alternating days from 7 through 21 days of age. LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to the high ethanol dose showed lower temperatures at the 60 and 120 min time points on each day of testing, compared with all other treatment groups. Temperatures of offspring prenatally exposed to the low ethanol dose did not differ from those of controls. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Seven of the original women returned for a 2nd study 3–5 mo postpartum. During late pregnancy, Ss showed increased wake after sleep onset (WASO) and a lower sleep efficiency (SE) in comparison with the control group. The percentage of REM sleep was significantly decreased and the pecentage of Stage 1 significantly increased compared with the nonpregnant Ss. At 3–5 mo postpartum, a significant reduction in WASO and increased SE was noted. Women in late pregnancy exhibit primarily sleep maintenance difficulties as a result of the discomfort, aches, and pains that are associated with pregnancy.

AB  - Reviews data on developmental disorders occurring in the fetus in diabetic pregnancy, focusing on the functional development of the CNS and on the techniques for studying this during the embryonic and fetal periods. Techniques for fetal behavioral teratogenicity testing in general are described, with maternal diabetes as an example. Maternal diabetes increases the risk for structural malformations of the fetal CNS. Abnormal functional development of the fetal nervous system exists also in diabetic pregnancy, even when well controlled. Indicative of this are a delayed emergence of fetal movement patterns in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, altered regulation of fetal breathing movements and delayed and/or disturbed emergence of fetal behavioral states (sleep–wake cycles) in the 3rd trimester, and continuity of poor behavioral state organization, immature EEG patterns, and a high incidence of periodic breathing in the neonatal period.

AB  - Explored the range of possible sleep-inducing techniques that are foreseen by pregnant women for their unborn infants. 120 primiparous women (19–42 yrs old) were interviewed about their sources of information about infant sleep, whether infant sleep could or should be induced, how this might be done, and why infants wake. Results show that most Ss believed that sleep is a spontaneous phenomenon, nevertheless they foresaw using sleep- inducing techniques. Caressing was preferred as a sleep-inducing technique, followed by rocking, talking and singing. Awakenings were mostly ascribed to malaise and hunger; sufficient sleep was rarely cited. The wide range of sleep-inducing techniques expectant mothers were willing to use, together with the contradictory belief about sleep spontaneity; suggests that they did not have a consistent concept of infant sleep.

A 2nd case illustrates a situation in which sleep/wake assessment by a trained observer assisted the medical team in confirming their diagnosis of massive brain damage and loss of function in an anencephalic newborn. The use of sleep variables in evaluating other behavioral and medical conditions in the young infant is also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated fetal behavior in 12 normal pregnancies after 41 wks of gestation as compared to 12 control term fetuses. Ss underwent a behavioral study using cardiotocography to record the heart rate, and 2 ultrasound scanners to observe body and eye movements. Fetuses in both groups clearly exhibited fetal behavior states (FBS) 1F–4F. The median percentage of FBS 3F and 4F (awake states) increased significantly from 6% in the term group to 21.5% in fetuses after 41 wks. FBS 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) decreased from 92% to 78% at the expense of FBS 2F which decreased from 78% to 58%. The fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP) associated with FBS 3F and 4F were impressive. For example, in FBS 4F, the FHRP showed large amplitude, prolonged accelerations that fused into a sustained tachycardia with only short periods of return to the baseline, resembling tachycardia with decelerations.

AU  - Li, Hong
T2  - Acta Psychologica Sinica
AB  - Studied the affection of fetal music on the fetus from the aspects of the fetus' response, memory, and the principle factors in a double-blind research. Human Ss: 31 normal female Chinese adults (aged 23–35 yrs) (educated beyond junior high school) (Exp group). 29 normal female Chinese adults (aged 23–35 yrs) (educated beyond junior high school) (Control group). Ss with 28-wk pregnancy in Exp group were asked to let the fetus listen to a 30-min music tape before getting up in the morning and going to sleep at night and to record the moving time of the fetus (moving, frequency, continued time) while Ss in the control group were asked to record the moving time of the fetus only. After birth, the Exp Ss' babies listened to the music again and were stimulated by touch, light, and human voice; the fetus' responses were recorded and scored. The moving times and the responses of the fetuses in the 2 groups were compared. The relationships of the responses of the fetus and related factors—mother's age, attitude to pregnancy, education level, parents relationship, father's smoking, sex of the fetus, and types of neuroactivation—were studied using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).

TI  - Circadian rhythm of cell proliferation in the telencephalic ventricular zone: Effect of in utero exposure to ethanol.
AU  - Miller, Michael W.
T2  - Brain Research
AB  - Pregnant rats were given an ethanol-containing (6.7% v/v) liquid diet ad libitum between gestational day (GD) 6 and GD 18, pair-fed an isocaloric liquid control diet, or fed chow and water. Throughout the experiments, the Ss were fed either at 8 or 17 hrs. Ss were given a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine on GD 17 at one point during a 24-hr period. Pair-fed control Ss (fed at 8 or 17 hrs) consumed their food within 4 hrs of presentation. The ratio of cells passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle changed diurnally; the ratio was highest during the day and lowest during the night. In contrast, the ethanol-fed rats grazed on their food throughout the dark cycle regardless of when the food was presented. The elimination of the fetal circadian rhythm in cell proliferation during prenatal exposure to ethanol shows the resiliency of the developing system.

TI  - Photoperiodic regulation of the time of birth in rats: Involvement of circadian endogenous mechanisms.
AU  - Bosc, M. J.
T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Maintained pregnant rats on a standard light–dark (LD) cycle or on fixed LD cycles with periods of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hrs after Day 8 of gestation. At the end of gestation, activity was manifested at moments corresponding to the night of the standard regimen in most groups; it was delayed in the 2 groups lit up exclusively at evening (PM) hrs. In groups receiving light exclusively at morning (AM) hrs, birth times were delayed compared to the deliveries in groups receiving light at PM hrs only. An intermediate distribution of birth times was observed when AM and PM hrs were stimulated every 12 hrs. The apparent stability of the diurnal rhythm of activity and the difference in birth time distributions due to the period of light phase indicate that the regulation of birth time by photoperiod is due to a circadian mechanism in the rats. This mechanism implicates at least 2 endogenous systems which are apparently antagonists with regard to birth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined pregnancy outcome and offspring development in alcohol-sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) and alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mice following prenatal exposure to a high dose of ethanol or sucrose. Untreated controls were maintained for each line. Mortality at 10 days of age was greater for LS litters that received prenatal ethanol than for the LS sucrose or control litters. Prenatal ethanol did not affect mortality in SS litters. Thus, genetically based alcohol sensitivity seems to influence severity of alcohol-related birth defects.

T2  - Human Physiology
AB  - Examined the course of physiological delivery in 170 normal female Ss (aged 16–39 yrs), to demonstrate the existence of a specific class of accompanying psychic states. Ss were compared with a control group of 12 women (aged 19��30 yrs) who had disclaimed pregnancy in their anamnesis. Structured interviews were supplemented with an examination of medical documents, opinion of the doctor in charge, and observation data, on the 2nd–4th day post-delivery. Ss were administered a specially devised questionnaire to assess their psychic status during the course of pre- and post-delivery. Results show presence of unusual psychic phenomena of varied content in 83.5% of Ss during gestation, which increased to 87.6% post-delivery. These phenomena occurred both during sleep and wakefulness periods. Findings implicate these as a distinct new class of altered psychic states.

Ss whose mothers had been stressed during the 1st trimester showed a reduction in ambulatory behavior measured in the open field and a reduction in adrenal weight after open-field exposure. Ss exposed to prenatal stress (PNS) during the 2nd trimester showed an increased susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced clonic convulsions, and a reduction in adrenal weight after PTZ administration and open-field exposure. Ss exposed to PNS during the third trimester showed a reduction in susceptibility to PTZ. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Scribner, Stephen J.

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Monitored the extent of disruption in the daily rhythm of core body temperature, nest attendance, activity, and wheel running in 7 Djungarian and 6 Siberian hamster females implanted intraperitoneal/ly (ip) with biotelemetric thermistors. The amplitude of each rhythm decreased during late gestation, culminating in a substantial disruption at parturition, and did not begin a recovery until the latter 3rd of lactation. In each species, the change in the core body temperature rhythm was primarily the result of an elevation in light phase body temperature to approximate the normally occurring dark phase temperature, although the disruption was more extensive in Siberian than in Djungarian Ss. As this maternal hyperthermia is associated with the provision of essential heat to the altricial litter, these species differences in the vulnerability to hyperthermia may constrain the reproductive success of these extreme cold adapted small mammals.

AB  - Presents longitudinal data on interactions between 32 group-living adult pigtail macaque females and 15 infants (less than 12 wks of age) during the 6 wks prior to conception, the 24 wks of pregnancy, and the 1st 12 wks of lactation. These periods represent different hormonal conditions in the reproductive cycle. Infant-directed behavior increased in frequency during early and middle pregnancy, decreased around the time of parturition, and increased again during lactation. The frequency of infant-directed behavior also increased significantly in the 2 wks after infant loss during lactation. Results indicate that maternal responsiveness in nonhuman primates develops during pregnancy and it is probably hormonally regulated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined a pair of preterm, opposite-sex twins (aged 27–29 days old) during the lying-in period for behavioral and morphological effects of maternal alcohol and pentazocine abuse during pregnancy. The male's behavioral scores were more likely to be deviant from the standardized mean than the female's. The male was more irritable, both spontaneously and in response to specific stimuli; highly active while awake and handled for the presentation of stimuli; more active than average during sleep; and low on ratings that reflect the attitude of the examiner toward the infant. Findings imply individual and gender differences in behavioral susceptibility to teratogens. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied the relationship between sleep disruption prior to the birth, during labor, and in the early postpartum period and the subsequent development of the postnatal blues in 63 women. Results suggest that 2 factors, a night-time labor and a history of sleep disruption in the latter stages of pregnancy, may have etiological importance in the development of postnatal blues. Sleep disruption on the nights following the birth, the 3rd sleep factor studied, had little impact on the expression of the blues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Early Human Development
AB  - Examined 96 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 wks of gestation to determine the relationship between the duration of the active state following a single vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) and the time spent in quiet sleep (QS). All fetuses were observed to enter QS prior to testing. After remaining in this state for 3 min, each fetus was randomized into 1 of 3 groups: no stimulation (Group I), a single 1 sec VAS delivered after 3–5 min of QS (Group II), and a single 1 sec VAS delivered after 18–20 min of QS (Group III). There was no effect of QS duration on the sensitivity to VAS. Group III fetuses behaved similarly to Group I fetuses. Group II fetuses remained in a more active state for a shorter length of time than did Group I or Group III fetuses. The mean duration of the active period was significantly less for Group II fetuses than for fetuses in either Groups I or III. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Identifies cocaine (COC) abuse, through all methods of administration, as a significant risk factor for stroke in people under 45 yrs. A stroke may follow COC use by as little as a few seconds or as long as 12 hrs. Persons with genetic pseudocholinesterase deficiency could be particularly susceptible to stroke or transient ischemic attack following COC use. COC use has been correlated with exacerbation of movement disorders and malignant hyperthermia characterized by hyperpyrexia, agitation, and profound hemodynamic instability. In addition, COC exerts a significant influence on the outcome of pregnancy and on neonatal behavior. Less commonly reported complications include optic neuropathy, brain abscess, migraine-like headaches, and cerebral atrophy. Psychiatric complications related to the abuse of COC include intoxication, withdrawal, delirium, delusional disorders, panic attacks, and impact on sleep and sexuality.

AB  - Instantaneous observations were made with video every 6 min for 3 days following the introduction of pregnant sows into one of the following 3 environments: loose housing (20 sows); semi-confinement (16 sows); and confinement (16 sows). Direct observations of straw-directed behavior after feeding were made. Bar-biting was most frequent in confinement and least in loose housing. Differences in frequencies of stereotypies apparently depended on the housing system. Many movements in the stereotyped sequences of the confined sows resembled elements in the nesting sequences of loose-housed sows, supporting the hypothesis that a thwarted movement pattern can develop into a stereotypy, which then may bear resemblance to normal movements.

Six mean spectral values were calculated from each corresponding minute of digitized data. Each group displayed significant differences among sleep-state segments for all spectral values. Significant differences in EEG spectral values were noted among states of sleep for both preterm and full-term Ss of similar postconceptional term ages. Mean EEG spectral values per minute in preterm Ss differed from those of full-term Ss during specific segments of the neonatal EEG sleep cycle, with preterm Ss demonstrating lower spectral values in the alpha, beta, delta, and theta frequency ranges, depending on the segment of the sleep cycle.

AB  - A reciprocal cross study was conducted in an animal model using C57BL/6J (B6) and long-sleep (LS) mice. B6 and LS dams were reciprocally mated to B6 or LS males producing 4 embryonic genotype groups: the true-bred B6B6 and LSLS genotypes, and the genetically similar B6LS and LSB6 genotypes (the F₁ genotype). Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of sucrose on Day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on Gestation Day 18, weighed, and assessed for soft tissue or skeletal malformations. Results showed a greater litter weight deficit and increased total malformation rate in ethanol-exposed F₁ litters carried by B6 mothers compared to ethanol-exposed F₁ litters carried by LS mothers. Maternal genetic factors were important determinants of susceptibility to prenatal alcohol effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Developmental Brain Research
AB  - Exp 1 examined the effects of periodic feeding (food cue) on circadian rhythmicity in pups from pregnant rats with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The phase of drinking behavior rhythm was examined in pups reared in constant darkness beginning at weaning. In 2 of the uncued control litters, pup phases at weaning were scattered. In the 4 control litters where within-litter coordination of phase was observed, the average litter phase was unpredictable. In contrast, Ss' drinking rhythms were synchronized within and between litters, suggesting that prenatal food cue entrained fetuses. Similar results were obtained when offspring of SCN-lesioned cued dams were fostered to lesioned, uncued dams on day of birth (Exp 2), indicating that the effects of food cue occur prenatally. Redundant mechanisms appeared to communicate time-of-day information to the fetus. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examines issues related to the measurement of cortisol in saliva as a tool for investigations of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Since saliva samples can be obtained stress-free and independent from medically trained personnel, this method may be well-suited for use in psychobiological studies. Research concerning the effects of circadian rhythm, pregnancy, and oral contraceptive use on cortisol levels is reviewed, and the effects of physical and psychological stress are considered. Methodological and practical research issues are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared the behavior of 18 3-yr-old children who were born preterm with that of 18 full-term children of the same age. The preterm group was comprised of children who were born between 32 and 37 wks gestation and weighed between 1,500 and 2,500 g at birth, making it a "low-risk" group. Behavior was measured with the Behaviour Questionnaire of N. Richman et al (1982) and maternal mental health was measured with the Malaise Inventory of M. Rutter et al (1970). The preterm group showed significantly more problems when certain individual behaviors were considered, namely sleep related problems, tempers and dependence. The preterm group had also had significantly more accidents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The Journal of Neuroscience
AB  - Prenatal treatment with the D₁-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 or cocaine induces expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the fetal rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Weaver et al., 1992). Because the induction of c-fos gene expression in the SCN has been implicated in the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light in mature animals, the present study investigated whether prenatal dopaminergic activation entrains the fetal circadian pacemaker. Injections of SKF 38393 (8 mg/kg) were given to pregnant, SCN-lesioned hamsters during the last 5 d of gestation and the phases of the offspring’s wheel-running activity rhythms were measured on postnatal day 20. Pregnant hamsters were each given two injections/day 12 hr apart, but only one of the injections each day contained SKF 38393. One group of hamsters received the drug at 0800 hr while another group received the drug at 2000 hr. The offspring from these treatment groups showed average phases that differed by 11.3 hr, demonstrating that prenatal SKF 38393 set the phase of the offspring’s circadian rhythms. These results suggest that the fetal circadian pacemaker can be entrained by dopaminergic activation. In situ hybridization using cRNA probes demonstrated that a single injection of SKF 38393 on the last day of gestation induced c-fos gene expression in the fetal hamster SCN and that mRNA for the D₁-dopamine receptor was present in the SCN at that time. It is possible that maternal entrainment of the fetal circadian pacemaker, which normally occurs during development, is mediated by dopaminergic activation within the fetal hypothalamus.

AB  - Studied the ontogeny and temporal organization of nonnutritive sucking during active sleep in 6 healthy preterm infants (birthweight 0.8–2.3 kg; gestational age 26–30 wks) from 30 to 35 wks postmenstrual age. Results reveal recognizable rhythmical sucking bursts at 28 wks of age in 1 S and by 31–33 wks in the other Ss. The number of bursts each minute increased with age, while the duration of each burst was stable (mean 4.1 sec). The pause between bursts decreased. Sucking pace within bursts increased with age, which resulted in an increase in the overall rate of sucking. The intraburst sucking rhythm was fairly stable from 30 wks of gestation, whereas the interburst rhythm was less regular. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Investigated differential alcohol sensitivity in the etiology of fetal alcohol effects (FAEs), using the long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mouse lines, selectively bred for differences in ethanol (E)-induced narcosis. LS and SS mice were intubated with either 2.9 g/kg E or an isocaloric amount of sucrose twice per day on Days 7–25 of pregnancy. An untreated control group was maintained for each line. LS offspring prenatally exposed to E exhibited increased open-field activity relative to LS controls, but this effect was due to the overactivity of 1 litter. Activity for SS Ss prenatally exposed to E did not differ from control levels. In Exp II, females were treated from Days 7–28 of gestation, and their offspring were tested for either open-field activity or passive avoidance learning. There were no group differences in open-field activity, but LS Ss prenatally exposed to alcohol took more trials to reach a passive avoidance criterion than their controls.

T2  - Behavioural Brain Research
AB  - Reports evidence showing that the human oculomotor system becomes active long before birth: At about 16 wks (postmenstrual age) the first slow changes of eye position can be observed with the aid of real-time ultrasonography. At 18–20 wks more rapid eye movements (EMs) are detectable. There is a gradual decline in the percentage of time spent in rapid and slow EMs from 32–40 wks. These EMs are organized in episodes of activity, divided by episodes of quiescence that, at first, are unrelated to cyclical changes in other variables (e.g., breathing, body movements, or heart-rate patterns). At about 36 wks gestation, REM and NREM episodes become linked with other changes and then represent behavioral states identical to those seen in newborn infants. This organization of behavioral states in the fetus is identical with that found in preterm infants of comparable age. Opening of eyelids is difficult to see before birth but the existence of episodes of wakefulness seems most probable. Hence, fetal EMs are in part related to wakefulness. In the newborn at term, the interval distributions of REMs during sleep and of scanning EMs during wakefulness are statistically different.

The Maxwells feel that the reviewers were unfair and patronizing. They contend that their book makes 52 very specific suggestions to all parents, not just ghetto dwellers. The reviewers accuse them of being "well-intentioned but superficial and often misinformed and uninformed." The only instances cited of such "uninformed" opinions are "avoiding out-of-wedlock pregnancies and having the baby sleep with the parents." The authors say the tied out-of-wedlock pregnancies to stress and that the reviewers appear totally unaware of the vast research connecting IQ to stress. The authors also state that sleeping patterns yield breathing skills that yield secure feelings that yield articulate speech forms that yield clearer thinking skills that yield higher IQ scores.

AB  - Reviews the literature on the systematic use of hypnosis in psychosomatic medicine in the USSR and discusses issues such as the electrophysiological differences between hypnosis and sleep, hypnotic suggestibility, and the role of Ss' attitudes in the success of hypnosis. Hypnosis has been widely used in psychiatry and psychology, particularly in behavior modification, but has been found to be of only limited effectiveness as an anesthetic in surgery. In obstetrics, however, hypnosis has been found to reduce anxiety and fears related to childbirth. A study is reported in which 100 pregnant women were hypnotized in repeated sessions shortly before expected delivery. Only 5% of the Ss were totally unresponsive, and 53% achieved optimum results. None of the Ss suffered shock or trauma in giving birth, and Ss tended to lose track of time—a desirable effect in the case of protracted labor.

AB  - Studied a 30-yr-old woman and a 38-yr-old woman with pseudocyesis (the false belief in pregnancy), using a multimodal investigatory approach focusing on the association of depression and alterations in endocrine secretory patterns. Results show that both Ss had abnormal growth hormone secretory patterns, as demonstrated by lack of sleep-associated peaks and the absence of a response to levodopa administration. Both Ss had elevated testosterone and estradiol levels and normal prolactin levels. One S met DSM-III criteria for a major depressive episode, and she had abnormally elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and large LH pulse amplitudes. These findings, together with a review of cases reported in the literature, suggest that no single neuroendocrine profile is common to all patients with pseudocyesis.

While behavioral states can be recognized around the 36th gestation week through scanner techniques, reliable postnatal observations are feasible during the 1st 4 mo of life using the most advanced technologies. These discriminate between sleep and wakefulness states following the changing patterns of the 1st 4 mo as defined by spontaneous EEG waves (behavioral and/or electrophysiological criteria). The ability of the infant's mother or caregiver to discriminate between its behavioral states may affect the dyadic relationship, often with long-range consequences for the child's development.

AU  - González Delgado, José B.
T2  - Boletin de Psicologia (Cuba)
AB  - Calculated physical biorhythms in 29 women whose pregnancies ended with the birth of a dead fetus. Birth weight was 500 g or more. Fetuses were divided into those without signs of maceration (recently dead), with maceration, and with major malformations and other associated causes of mortality. A highly significant and frequent correlation was found between the delivery date of the dead fetuses and the negative phase of the physical cycle of the mothers' biorhythms. All 11 births of macerated dead fetuses without apparent signs of malformations, 8 of 11 births of macerated fetuses, and 5 of 7 births of fetuses that died of other causes occurred during days corresponding to the negative phase of the physical cycle. The findings confirm the role of biorhythms as a possible fetal and perinatal risk factor. The need for applied investigations on a larger scale is emphasized.

AU  - Bille, Bo
T2  - Cephalalgia
AB  - In 1955 a population study in Uppsala comprising about 9,000 school children showed that migraine increased from 1.4% at the age of seven to 5.3% at fifteen. With increasing age there was an increasing predominance of girls. A matched comparison between 73 children with more pronounced migraine and 73 control children showed a greater tendency in the migraine group to abdominal pain, motion sickness, sleep disturbance and orthostatic symptoms. In a longitudinal study lasting 23 years the 73 migraine children were followed-up until all were over 30 years of age. During puberty and as young adults 62% were free from migraine for at least two years. Of these, 22% again suffered migraine regularly. Thus, 60% had migraine attacks at 30. Girls seem to have a greater relapse rate than boys. Most of the girls with classical migraine were headache free during pregnancy. Every third family with one parent belonging to the migraine group and with children over four years of age had one child with migraine symptoms. Migraine seems to be more frequently inherited via the mother, and to girls. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Anxiety, depression, irritability, sleep disturbance, and 12 observer ratings were assessed each time. Total SPI scores increased significantly after childbirth. 13 Ss had a severe postnatal depression and a further 17 had milder depression, which in 15 lasted at least 4 wks. Marked deterioration of their marital relationships was reported by the depressed Ss. Ss with severe postnatal blues were particularly at risk of developing persistent depressive symptoms subsequently. Ss whose own mothers were dead were more likely to experience psychiatric symptoms immediately after childbirth, but not in the late puerperium.

Symptoms such as persistent irritability, an ineffective sucking reflex, and sleep disturbance may last for several months, and characteristics such as emotional lability and distractibility may persist through the preschool years. Means of recognizing and treating the disorder are discussed. The cases of 2 pregnant narcotics abusers illustrate the significance that early recognition of maternal narcotic dependence can have on neonatal morbidity.

AB  - Analyzed 65 polygraphic recordings obtained from 21 fetal lambs ranging from 112 to 144 days of gestation (term, 145 days). Results show that the transition from disorganized to organized behavioral state patterns occurred at 115–220 days. Physiologic characteristics of the arousal, quiet sleep (QS), and REM sleep (REMS) states were qualitatively similar to those in the adult. There was initially a high proportion of REMS, with only 11% time spent in arousal. The direct transition from arousal to REMS without a QS period was frequently seen at all ages. Quantitative changes in the distribution of behavioral states continued throughout gestation. There was a decrease in the incidence of REMS, with a small increase in arousal and QS. The duration of QS and REMS episodes increased with age until a steady level was achieved by 130 days. There was an increase in the frequency of arousal periods, with no change in episode duration.

AB  - 826 26-yr-old and 734 32-yr-old females, who were members of the UK National Survey of Health and Development and who had been followed-up from their birth in 1946 to the time of the present study, were asked whether they were under nervous strain in their work. Results show that 2 of every 5 Ss working full-time reported that they were under strain, this proportion being very similar to that for men in full-time work at the same age. Ss in part-time work were much less likely to report strain. Strain at work was related to the level of work (jobs in higher social-group categories having a higher report of strain) and to the level of supervisory responsibility. Ss reporting strain were also more likely to report problems with their sleep, frequent headaches, stomach pain, and back trouble. It is concluded that, with the possible exception of pregnant women, it is not helpful to consider women as a group of workers with particular problems in withstanding stress at work.

AB  - Traced changes in food intake and body weight of 83 hamsters over the estrous cycle, pregnancy, lactation, and the postsuckling period. Food intake varied with the estrous cycle but did not increase during pregnancy. During postpartum, food intake increased in proportion to litter size, and body weight decreased. The postsuckling period was accompanied by a decrease in food intake and an increase in body weight. Prolactin injections did not maintain the elevated food intake during the postsuckling period or stimulate food intake when administered for a 7-day period to virgin Ss. The mechanisms and functional implications of the contrasting patterns of energy regulation in hamsters and rats are discussed. (37 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Primates
AB  - Compared behavioral changes during weaning of 3 chimpanzee infants in captive social groups with those of infants in the natural habitat. The behaviors of 2 orphan male chimps that received maternal care from nulliparous females in captivity were also studied. In captivity, the target mother–infant pair's simultaneous behaviors were sampled at 60-sec intervals for 30-min observation periods 3 times/wk. Results of the weaning process were the same for the mother–infant pairs in captivity and the natural habitat. Weaning was related to resumption of mother's sexual cycles, next pregnancy, and birth of a sibling. During final weaning, there was cessation of suckling, a decrease in contact time with mother, a decrease or termination of being carried by mother, and the initiation of mother and infant sleeping apart. The captive Ss did not respond to weaning with depression or regression to infantile behaviors as did Ss in the natural habitat. The social and physical environmental differences between the 2-habitats facilitated a less-stressful weaning period for the captive mother–infant pairs.

AB  - Dams of 2 rat lines developed to differer in voluntary alcohol intake, alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-avoiding (ANA), were given an alcohol and sucrose solution as the sole drink throughout gestation. Sleep–wake behavior of offspring was studied at 7, 14, and 20 days. Prenatal alcohol exposure increased the percentage of waking in ANA rats but decreased the percentage of active sleep. When rats were 3 mo old, voluntary intake of alcohol increased for alcohol-exposed ANA rats and decreased for alcohol-exposed AA rats. Results indicate that AA rats may compensate for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behavior, whereas offspring of the alcohol-exposed ANA dams suffer from severe behavioral disturbances.

T2  - Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics & Gynecology
AB  - Provides a framework within which a model of parental orientations has been structured. This model delineates 2 maternal (facilitator and regulator) and 2 paternal (participator and renouncer) approaches to pregnancy and parenthood, which offer a variety of combinations and resolutions to the conflicts posed by modern parenthood. Data were derived from psychotherapeutic practice with 63 pregnant women, observations of 23 mother–child pairs, questionnaire surveys of 81 Ss, and interviews with couples attending childbirth preparation classes. The resulting psychodynamic exposition model is divided into 4 sections having to do with (1) expectant mothers (attitudes, adaptation to pregnancy, birth and bonding), (2) expectant fathers, (3) early motherhood (feeding, sleep, communication), and (4) separation-individuation. It is suggested that future parental practices may be predicted from responses to pregnancy and that these responses are also aligned with different orientations toward labor and birth.

AB  - At Day 21 of gestation, 4 individual, pregnant, Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously monitored for ultrasound with a Holgate bat detector until delivery of the 1st pup. Two nonpregnant controls were monitored over similar time periods. Pregnant Ss produced more ultrasound than nonpregnant Ss. The primary frequency component of the calls was 40 kHz. On the day of delivery, pregnant Ss emitted significantly more ultrasound (15–60 kHz) than on the day preceding delivery. All Ss produced some ultrasound which exhibited diurnal fluctuations. This ultrasound might be related to stress during labor or be a signal to conspecifics. (11 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Brain Research
AB  - Biorhythms of sleep, wakefulness, and paradoxical sleep were studied using EEG recording in 19 unanesthetized, freely moving female rats. Ss subjected to light and dark schedule (LD) during the period of gestation and through puberty exhibited a diurnal rhythm of sleep and paradoxical sleep, a circadian rhythm with peaks of sleep during the light phase. When these Ss were transferred from LD to continuous illumination (CI), circadian rhythm was annihilated, and all rhythms disappeared. It seems likely that light served as synchronizer or oscillator for regulation of circadian rhythm. However, in Ss subjected to CI during the period of gestation and puberty, light apparently did not serve as synchronizer or oscillator for the regulation of circadian rhythm. These Ss exhibited a nocturnal rhythm of sleep and paradoxical sleep, a circadian rhythm with peaks of sleep during midnight. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Results show systematic and long-lasting alterations of the period of the free-running activity rhythm following parturition. It is suggested that the effects of estrous, seasonal, and gestational reproductive states on circadian rhythms may be mediated by the endocrine events that accompany these states.

Studies on time sharing by parent doves, photoperiodic time measurement in mammals, and the luteinizing hormone surge during ovulation and heat in rats are reviewed. The role of circadian and interval timers in these reproductive paradigms is considered. It is concluded that the interval timing mechanisms, which are differentiated from circadian timers in terms of real-time accuracy, are essential to the coordination and synchronization of reproductive events.

AB  - HS/Ibg (heterogeneous stock) mice dams were fed milled mouse food containing 3 g/kg phenobarbital (PhB) in acid form and water as their only nutritional source from Gestation Days 9–29. Blood PhB levels of treated females and fetuses were 40–200 μg/ml blood. At the age of 50 days, male offspring were injected with C–1–4-sodium pentobarbital (PenB) (50 mg/kg). Sleep time and temperature loss were monitored and, in randomly selected individuals, brain PenB levels were determined upon awakening. The experiment was repeated on the same Ss for 3 consecutive days. All offspring developed functional CNS tolerance during the 3 testing days as evidenced by the daily decrease in sleep time and increased brain levels of PenB upon awakening. Offspring who received PhB prenatally had generally shorter sleep times, less temperature loss, and higher brain PenB levels on awakening than controls. The differences were most pronounced on the 2nd day. (13 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Used deoxyglucose labeled with carbon-14 to study the utilization of glucose in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of fetal rats. Female albino rats were subjected to daily cycles of 12 hrs light and 12 hrs dark. Later in gestation, Ss were kept in complete darkness and then injected with deoxyglucose. The Ss were killed, and the brains of Ss and their fetuses were examined. Results show that an entrainable circadian clock is present in the suprachiasmatic nuclei during fetal development and that the maternal circadian system coordinates the phase of the fetal clock to environmental lighting conditions. This maternal communication may have evolved to prepare the developing mammal for entry into the external environment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - American Journal of Primatology
AB  - Observed the sexual behavior of 15 female and 7 male captive adult chimpanzees over a 3-mo period and compared relative frequencies of successful and unsuccessful copulatory attempts to levels of anogenital swelling and reproductive status. In addition, the data were analyzed in relation to 3 indicators of female primate sexuality: (1) proceptiveness, indicated by female attempts at sexual interaction; (2) attractiveness, indicated by male-initiated attempts; and (3) receptiveness, evident when a female responds positively to male initiation. Data suggest that increased level of anogenital swelling enhanced female proceptiveness and attractiveness but not receptiveness. Comparison of cycling vs pregnant females revealed that attractiveness and receptiveness increased during pregnancy, while proceptiveness was relatively unchanged. The total success rate (copulations/attempts) was 63.3% (42% for female-initiated attempts and 77% for male-initiated attempts). Pregnant females copulated at a high rate, almost double that of cycling females. Sexual activity during pregnancy and the occurrence of anogenital swelling during pregnancy are discussed in terms of female reproductive strategies.

AU  - Terkel, Joseph

T2  - Hormones and Behavior
AB  - A positive correlation between the number of preejaculatory intromissions that a female receives during copulation and the probability of successful pregnancy has been demonstrated previously. In the present investigation the nocturnal secretion of prolactin (PRL) was followed for 4 days after mating in female Sprague-Dawley rats receiving either 3–5 intromissions before ejaculation (low intromission group) or 15–28 intromissions (high intromission group). Nightly PRL surges occurred in most of the females (9 of 12) in the high intromission group, and the same 9 females became pregnant. Only 2 of 9 females in the low intromission group exhibited nightly PRL surges and again only these 2 females became pregnant. Results demonstrate that the stimulation that the female receives from multiple intromissions during mating is effective in setting off nightly PRL surges. It is proposed that the so-called pregnancy-inducing neuroendocrine reflex that is triggered in this manner is expressed in a characteristic pattern of nightly surges of prolactin, the hormone known to be essential for the activation of the corpora lutea and their secretion of progesterone.

AU  - FitzGerald, Catherine M.
T2  - British Journal of Medical Psychology
AB  - Prospective data on 86 pregnant women (mean age 25.9 yrs) were analyzed to investigate the relationship between the pregnancy symptoms of nausea and vomiting and various demographic, social, and psychological factors. In contrast to previous findings, no significant differences were discovered along demographic or social dimensions between Ss reporting no nausea, mild nausea, and severe nausea during the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Not surprisingly, those Ss experiencing severe nausea reported significantly more sleep disturbances, fatigue, and irritability. Ss having both nausea and vomiting during the 1st trimester reported significantly more unplanned, undesired pregnancies and negative relationships with their own mothers than 1st-trimester groups experiencing nausea only or no symptoms. Finally, those with continuing nausea and vomiting in the 3rd trimester, when compared with those having no symptoms, tended to have reported significantly more psychological/psychiatric problems in the 1st trimester and were significantly more negative in their assessment of their own maternal relationship.

T2  - Infant Mental Health Journal
AB  - Examined a pilot study cohort of 29 infants with severe and persistent sleep disorders that began in the 1st 18 mo of life. S characteristics discussed include age, sex, associated troubles, modalities of soothing, effect of hypnotic drugs, and development under treatment. Some Ss were very active. Often, the pregnancy was marked by a traumatic event or by depression or anxiety in the mother. During evaluation of the mother–child interaction, a withdrawal of the mother's cathexis toward her child was often noted, which could accompany hyperstimulation in the relationship. This withdrawal concerned the emotional and fantasied dimensions of the interaction. The child's reactions and initiatives paralleled the mother's speech, motor, and emotional attitudes.

AB  - Interviewed 24 expectant couples in the 8th mo of pregnancy to determine if they noted any patterns in fetal behavior that created for them a sense of their unborn as an individual. The data indicate that both prospective mothers and fathers described individual characteristics of their fetus in relation to appearance, communication, gender, temperament, and sleep–wake cycle. Ss were aware of their unborn infant as a separate person, interpreted the behavior as having meaning, and many interacted with the fetus during the last trimester. The data corresponded to empirical evidence of fetal behavior, indicating that the fetus hears and responds to sounds at 24 wks of pregnancy and has achieved full consciousness by 32 wks.

AB  - Female Sabra mice (genetically heterogeneous) were fed milled mouse food containing 3 g/kg phenobarbital (PHB) and water as their only nutritional source from gestation days 9–28. Control dams received milled food and water. Blood PHB levels of treated females and fetuses were 40–200 μg/ml. At 50 days of age, male offspring were injected with 3.5 g/kg ethanol. Sleep time was monitored, and in randomly selected Ss, brain ethanol levels were determined upon awakening. To assess the rate of metabolism in the treated and control offspring, blood ethanol levels were determined in other randomly selected Ss at 60 and 120 min postinjection. Offspring who received PHB prenatally were resistant to the hypnotic effects of ethanol as evidenced by their significantly (33%) shorter sleep time compared to controls. Brain ethanol levels upon awakening were significantly higher than those of controls in the offspring born to the PHB-treated mothers, indicating that the resistance to ethanol was due to factors within the CNS.

Mental factors effecting sleep in the hospital include external stimuli, severe anxiety, sensory deprivation, immobilization, social isolation, and unfamiliarity with the setting. Medical disorders accompanied by sleep disturbances are discussed, including cardiovascular, renal and endocrine disorders, anorexia nervosa, obesity, and pregnancy. Medication effects on sleep are noted. Evaluation of sleep complaints in the hospital setting is described. It is noted that C-L psychiatrists can play a key role in educating physicians and nurses about sleep disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

The dams were fed either an 8 or a 25% casein diet for 5 wks before mating and during gestation and lactation. Dams on the low protein diet spent more time in the nest actively nursing their young than did high protein dams, and they exhibited no deficits in other maternal behaviors. Five of 11 kinds of behavior (e.g., grooming, eating) developed more slowly in the undernourished pups than in the well-nourished ones, but the developmental delays were no longer than a few days. Circadian fluctuations were apparent in all of the pups' activities during the 3rd postnatal week as well as in grooming and horizontal movement, 2 behaviors that were present by 6–20 days of age.

AU  - Johnston, Robert E.
T2  - Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology
AB  - Six experiments investigated the responses of male hamsters to the odors of estrous, diestrous, pregnant, and lactating hamsters. Scent-marking by males in the soiled cages of females was less frequent when the females were estrous (Day 1 of the cycle) than when females were on Days 2, 3, or 4. Sexually experienced males preferred the odors of bedding material from the cages of estrous Ss over odors of bedding of diestrous Ss. Both of these effects were eliminated by surgically removing the vagina and thereby eliminating vaginal secretions. The quantity of vaginal secretions deposited in the vicinity of the nest may be responsible for the observed effects. In contrast, neither males with sexual experience nor males with both sexual and nonsexual experience with females demonstrated preferences for the odors of the estrous or diestrous Ss themselves. Males were, however, more attracted to the odors emanating directly from estrous Ss than to the odors of pregnant or lactating Ss. For hamsters the important sexual message may be not "estrous" vs "diestrous" but rather may be "will soon be estrous" (i.e., cycling) vs "not soon estrous" (i.e., pregnant, lactating, or acyclic).

AB  - Compared etiological and developmental factors of 38 autistic children (aged 3–16 yrs) with those of 53 children with schizophrenia, 30 children with organic brain damage partially manifested as autism, and 30 children with communication difficulties secondary to neuroses. It was found that over 94% of autistic Ss had been born from a 1st pregnancy and that in a considerable number of the pregnancies the mother had experienced toxicosis, infectious or viral diseases, poisoning, trauma, or other complications. Common disorders in the autistic Ss during the 1st 3 yrs of life included hyperactivity, sleep disorders, digestive disorders, and poor coordination. The most characteristic feature of early psychomotor development was uneven and asynchronic maturation of functions such as walking and talking. Two or more signs of organic brain damage were found in over 94% of autistic Ss, and many showed disturbances in differentiation of "right" from "left." An analysis of intellectual development indicated that the average level was lower than in healthy peers but higher than in mentally retarded children of the same age. Analysis of speech behavior, memory, and thought indicated a depressed activation of the right hemisphere. The author discusses these results as supporting the theory that autism is a nonprogressive, qualitatively unique residual organic disorder since no exacerbations, remissions, or transformations were found.

AB  - Subacute withdrawal characterized by restlessness, agitation, tremors, sleep disturbance, and feeding problems had been found to persist for as long as 3–6 mo in human infants exposed to either heroin or methadone. Similarly, rats prenatally exposed to methadone were hyperactive and showed sleep disturbance that persisted for 3 wks (D. E. Hutchings et al, 1979). The present study tested the possibility that some of these prolonged behavioral effects are related to the persistence of methadone in the brain and liver. Tritiated 1-methadone hydrobromide (–3HME) was administered daily by gastric intubation to gravid Wistar rats during the last week of gestation. Fostered neonates were sacrificed every 5 days from birth to 30 days of age, and brains and livers were removed. Tissue –3HME was extracted, isolated, and counted. Highest concentrations of –3HME were present on the day of birth; after 5 days, approximately 22% remained. However, small but significant concentrations of –3HME were detected in tissues through 30 days of age. Results are discussed in terms of persistent opiate withdrawal symptoms in rat and human neonates. (9 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this study was to illuminate the interaction between mother and infant in the condition of infantile colic and compare this with the interaction in a non-colic group. Infantile colic was defined as daily inconsolable crying. The sample, 21 mother-infant dyads, were recruited from six welfare centres in the north-west (a middle-class area) of Stockholm, A non-colic group, ten mother-infant dyads, were used as control group. The methods used were observing the feeding situation, interviewing the mother about pregnancy, labour and delivery, mother's first contact with the newborn, maternity stay, duration of breastfeeding, the infant's crying and medication, mother's food habits, etc. The mother was then asked to fill in a Sleep/Activity Scale for the seven following days and nights. A questionnaire was sent six months post-partum to follow up the situation. Labour and delivery was a positive event for most of the mothers and all the fathers had taken part in it. The observations showed a tendency of disturbed mother-infant interaction during feeding. When the infant was crying it was usually the mother who took care and also developed several ways to try to console the infant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Child Development
AB  - Tested the efficacy of temporally patterned kinesthetic and auditory stimulation for promoting development of infants born prior to term by assigning 88 preterm infants, below 35 wks gestation, to 1 of 4 experimental or control groups. Control Ss received regular hospital care; FI Ss received 15 min of rocking/heartbeat stimulation each hour; self-activating Ss received rocking stimulation for 15 min after every 90 sec of inactivity; quasi-self-activating Ss received 15 min rocking/heartbeat when inactive for 90 sec, but only for 1 stimulation period per hour. Assessments included measures of neurological functioning, sleep–wake activity, mother–infant interaction, and mental and motor development at 8 and 24 mo of age. All experimental Ss, compared to controls, showed decreased rates of activity while in the hospital, fewer abnormal reflexes, and better orienting responses. At 24 mo of age, experimental Ss scored significantly higher on the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Few differences were found in parent–infant interaction patterns. Results indicate that both temporal patterning and contingent responsiveness in the preterm infant's early environment contribute positively to some aspects of the development of infants.

T2  - Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics
AB  - Examined the temperament of 126 preterm infants as part of a longitudinal study of infant temperament and behavior in a representative sample of 2,443 Australian infants. Using the Infant Temperament Questionnaire, previously revised and validated for an Australian population, ratings were made at 4–8 mo corrected age, and data for the preterm group (less than 37 wks gestation) were compared to those infants born at term (37–41 wks). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any of the sociodemographic variables, on the mother's global rating of temperament, or on the reported incidence of colic, sleep problems, and excessive crying. There were also no differences between premature and full-term infants on any of the individual dimensions or clinical categories of temperament. It is concluded that prematurity does not affect observed temperament at 4–8 mo but that high-risk infants who experience medical complications of prematurity and require intensive care for prolonged periods may represent an entirely different category of risk for subsequent difficult temperament and behavior problems.

AB  - Demonstrated that drugs like clonidine (an antihypertensive) and clomipramine HCl (an antidepressant), which act on noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission in the brain, suppress REM sleep in developing rats. It was found that, in adulthood, the neonatally treated Ss showed hyperactivity, hyperanxiety, reduced sexual behavior, disturbed sleep patterns, and reduced cerebral cortical size. The treatment induced an increase in voluntary alcohol consumption and a decreased adaptability of responses to changes in water deprivation in a Y-maze. It is concluded that, although little is known about long-term consequences of centrally acting drugs used during late gestation in humans, minor neurological disturbances have been reported in children born to hypertensive mothers treated with clonidine or alpha-methyldopa.

AB  - Investigated the differences in the concepts of mental health and mental illness between 50 Pathan Pakistan women and service providers by interviewing them and selecting 17 Ss for an in-depth interview. Discussions focused on social situation, conception, pregnancy, birth, childrearing, health, and illness. Preliminary findings show that cultural norms were dynamic and evolved out of attempts to solve issues on the basis of beliefs. Racism was an important variable. Ss saw health–illness and happiness–unhappiness as inevitable in life. Correct behavior in the face of these states was important. Feelings about the future were seen to be out of order in a belief system in which the future is in God's hands and unknowable. Personal responsibility was not understood in the same terms as it is accepted in the UK. Individualism was not as important to Ss as group identity. Racial incidents isolated Ss and their families because of fear and caused lack of sleep. In health care areas, Ss felt White mothers were given more time and attention.

AB  - Obtained sleep recordings on 10 pregnant women during their last mo. of pregnancy and for 3 consecutive nights following delivery. They also slept 1 additional night 2 wk. following delivery. A 2nd group of 4 Ss slept every 2 wk. from 1st mo. of pregnancy through 6-mo postpartum period. Results were (1) napping and total sleep time increased during 1st trimester; (2) Stage 4 suppression, which varied in intensity, usually began in late preganancy and returned to normal values shortly after delivery; (3) REM sleep suppression occurred immediately following delivery and had returned to normal values within a few days; (4) 1 S who bottle-fed her baby returned to normal in the shortest period of time; (5) primigravida, with a high score field dependency, exhibit more REM suppression, than multigravida, with field independency, on the 1st prepartum and 1st postpartum nights.

TI  - Development of sleep state patterns in the kitten.
AU  - Hoppenbrouwers, Toke
AU  - Sterman, M. B.
T2  - Experimental Neurology
AB  - Evaluated the maturation of sleep in 19 kittens from birth to 6 wks of age in terms of the emergence of temporal concordance between defining physiological parameters. Periodicity of the earliest alternation of states, the REM-NREM, or "basic rest activity cycle," was traced. Parameters studied included EEG, eye movements, neck EMG, gross motor activity, and respiration patterns. Ss were monitored in isolation for periods of 2-6 hrs. The most outstanding feature of polygraphic data between birth and 4 wks of age was the gradual coalescence of initially discordant physiological measures of sleep state. Prior to 3 wks of age, polygraphic patterns differed significantly from those of the adult cat, indicating that individual rates of maturation existed for each physiological system measured. Detectable cycles were clearly shorter than those observed in the adult cat. Findings suggest that developmental assessment of polygraphic pattern concordance might be a more useful index of sleep state maturation than evaluation based upon attempted comparisons with stable adult patterns. The maturation of a basic rest activity cycle may begin during gestation and be disrupted by the transition to extrauterine life. A postnatal period of 3-6 wks is required for maturation of sensorimotor and respiratory functions in the completion of this state. It is proposed that from this time to approximately 3 mo of age, forebrain maturation and environmental influences progressively mediate a mature sleep-wake cycle which is superimposed upon this basic level of organization.

AU  - Graber, Gary C.

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Examined the latency to onset of maternal behavior toward foster pups in 105 maternally naive female Long-Evans rats treated either with uterine distention, a sham procedure, or no uterine manipulation. Uterine distention was achieved by intrauterine injection of hypertonic saline. The treatments were applied to either cycling, Day 10 pseudopregnant, or Day 11 pseudopregnant-decidualized virgins. The latency to onset of maternal behavior for both pseudopregnant groups was significantly shorter than that for the nonpseudopregnant group, when uterine distention was applied. Results suggest that uterine distention during pregnancy (during high progesterone level) may bring about both pregnancy termination (delivery) and the almost immediate maternal behavior seen at parturition, by the same hormonal mechanism.

AB  - Studied the evolution of cortical activity from .6 of term in utero in 11 fetal lambs, and through most of parturition and the early postpartum period in 2 newborn lambs. At .8 of term the alternating periods of wakefulness and sleep were definite. During a period of electrocorticographic desynchronization, paradoxical sleep could be recognized by the return to slow wave sleep that occurred at the sounding of a bell and also by REMs. No apparent major modification of electrocortical activity accompanied the transition from intra- to extrauterine life. At parturition there was a sudden increase in muscular tone and a 50% decrease in paradoxical sleep. (French summary) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Baulu, Jean
T2  - Hormones and Behavior
AB  - Seasonal hormonal and sex skin coloration peaks were found to be synchronized in 56 free-ranging, socially enclosed, and individually isolated rhesus monkeys of both sexes, based on observations during the October-January mating season in Puerto Rico. Individually isolated females displayed a mid-cycle peak in sex skin coloration during the period of regular cycles (September-April). Females who became pregnant during the mating season did not show the significant sex skin coloration decrease seen in nonpregnant females during the months that follow the mating season. Environmental cues, perhaps acting on a seasonal biological clock rather than social factors, are thought to be mainly responsible for the synchronous seasonal fluctuations observed. The technique used for assessing changes in sex skin coloration is shown to be an effective and reliable method for recording seasonal and intramenstrual variations of sex hormones in free-ranging and captive rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, the procedure may prove useful in studies relating behavior with sex endocrines. (23 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Evaluated, under controlled laboratory conditions, the physiological and behavioral factors underlying the annual reproductive cycle of the squirrel monkey. Mating activity following the formation of 2 social groups served to synchronize the reproductive phases during the subsequent year of observation. Changes in male and female reproductive status were assessed during 4 designated phases: breeding, pregnancy, lactation, and fatting. Behavioral and somatic changes in gonadectomized Ss living in the social groups were also evaluated. The variations in behavior and physiology across the year are considered in terms of factors constraining the timing of the natural reproductive pattern.

AB  - Conducted 3 experiments with 185 female DBA mice to investigate whether the pheromones that mediate estrous synchrony and pregnancy blocking in mice are present in an extract containing the lipid portion of male mouse urine. Ss were exposed to odors of either water, SJL/J male mouse urine, dichloromethane, a dichloromethane extract (lipid portion), or aqueous portion of the urine extract. Only whole urine and the dichloromethane extract shortened the estrous cycles of the Ss. Both the estrous and diestrous parts of the cycle were affected. In addition, other Ss were exposed to similar stimuli (except the aqueous extract) as above within 24 hrs of insemination, and exposure was continued for 5 days. The whole urine exposed groups had significantly more blocked pregnancies than the water and dichloromethane groups, but there was only a trend toward more blocked pregnancies in dichloromethane extract groups.

T2  - Psychophysiology
AB  - Hypothesized that some mediator associated with sleep mechanisms may be produced in or may cross the placenta, thereby resulting in similarities in the fetal and maternal sleep cycles. 6 healthy, unwed pregnant women were studied. Their total sleep (without naps) and exercise patterns were standardized. Baseline sleep was studied in the 7th or 8th calendar mo. in the 9th mo., just after delivery, and 4-5 mo. later. Percentages of REMS and stage 4 were low in the 7th mo. and a bit lower in the 9th mo. in relation to 4 mo. postpartum baselines. The stages were normal. Virtually no dissociative phenomena were found. Of 42, there was not 1 antepartum S night in which REMS was abnormally elevated. Stage 4 was always evident. The high percentage of REM sleep in prematures and full-terms clearly has no correlate in the EEG patterns and percentages of maternal sleep stages in late pregnancy. Concurrent registrations of the mothers and their own newborns showed no significant correlation of sleep stage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Addiction in pregnancy is associated with high rates of obstetric complications, but it is unclear whether effects are due to direct drug action or to life-style. Prenatal care and counseling are rarely available. The question of addiction in pregnancy is unresolved. Among the problems of neonates are low birth weight, prematurity, withdrawal, prolonged hospitalization, reduced sucking performance, and abnormal sleep patterns. The offspring of addicts seem more likely to suffer neglect than other children, but the effects of poverty and addiction cannot be easily separated. Some results are presented from follow-up studies on the physical and mental development of these children. (15 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Describes long-term electrocorticogram (ECoG) records made of 21 guinea pig fetuses in utero between the 40th and 64th day of gestation. The activation patterns of paradoxical sleep (PS) and wakefulness appeared from the 40th day; slow-wave sleep (SWS) patterns appeared about the 49th day and were characterized by cortical spindles. Between the 40th and the 47th day, cerebral maturation was accompanied by a progressive decrease of a discontinuous ECoG activity state. From 53 days the ECoG patterns of states of vigilance were similar to those of the newborn guinea pig. The percentage of time spent in PS was very high (80-90% at 48 days) before the SWS appearance. These observations prove the existence of a prenatal differentiation of the states of vigilance. The differentiation stages were similar to those observed after birth in immature newborn mammals. No relationship existed between the sleep of mother and fetus. (20 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Corticosterone levels in Ss sampled at the peak of the 24-hr adrenocortical rhythm were elevated 60 min. after handling stimulation which was found to be a function of elevated resting corticosterone levels. In Exp.

AB  - All-night EEG and electrooculograph recordings from 13 women showed that the amount of sleep latency, the number of awakenings, and the amount of Stage 0 were greater in the pre- and postpartum periods than in the control period (the 1st wk. after menses) or in nonpregnant controls. Stage 1 REM was lower in the pre- and postpartum periods than in the nonpregnant group. The amount of Stage 4 was lower in the prepartum than in all other periods. In Ss studied throughout pregnancy, there was more total sleep time and more naps in early pregnancy than at other times. In late pregnancy sleep time decreased below nonpregnant levels. (31 ref.)

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Studied the behavioral and polygraphic characteristics of wakefulness and sleep in 9 premature guinea pigs, delivered by hysterotomy, from the 58-66th day of gestation. In the 58-day-old premature, the electrocorticographic patterns of sleep were already similar to those of the full term neonate; but signs of immaturity of the sleep-wakefulness rhythm were present. The percentage of time spent in paradoxical sleep (ps) was high (30%), and the periods of wakefulness were infrequent and short lasting (23%), whereas the frequency of appearance of the periods of waking and sleep was very high. A prenatal organization of the sleep behavior was achieved from the 61st-63rd day of gestation. During this critical period, an increase in the duration of wakefulness periods was observed and the percentage of ps decreased abruptly down to the neonate rate (7%). These observations suggest that cerebral maturation plays a role in the organization of the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness. (26 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reports results of an investigation of 63 women admitted during a 2-yr period to a methadone maintenance treatment program for hard-core drug addicts. Ss were gradually maintained on daily doses of 60-120 mg. 43 women began to menstruate regularly within 2 mo., and 8 women became pregnant. 5 of the pregnant Ss delivered normal infants with Apgar scores between 9-10. 1 S had an abortion, and 1 fetus died of cord strangulation. Autopsy revealed no signs of methadone-related causes. Very minimal withdrawal symptoms were observed in several of the infants; however, none required active methadone therapy.

AU  - Garrick, Leslie D.
T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - Measured several thermoregulatory parameters for female and male blue spiny iguanid lizards during 1 reproductive season. Body temperatures, body temperature thresholds for thermoregulatory behavior, and thermoregulatory activity all declined to a minimum at pregnancy as Ss progressed through preovulatory and ovulatory states. Marked increases in these parameters occurred in postparturient Ss. Males were not significantly different from postparturients. Progesterone administration significantly depressed body temperature levels and body temperature thresholds for thermoregulatory behavior, but not thermoregulatory activity in another postparturient group. I. P. Callard et al detected greater amounts of plasma progesterone in pregnant S. cyanogenys compared to other reproductive states. Therefore, it is proposed that during pregnancy progesterone functions to modulate thermoregulatory behavior and energy expenditure. Results support the idea that the sensitivity of the thermostatic components to internal and external environmental factors determines a labile rather than a fixed regulated body temperature in some reptiles.

AB  - Evaluated sexually naive Ss 4 wk. after adrenalectomy. Mating behavior was normal but the number of ova ovulated was significantly reduced in experimental Ss. Embryonic swellings were fewer at Day 10 of gestation. Embryonic weights on the same day were not affected whereas uterine weight on the morning of vaginal estrus was increased. It is concluded that adrenalectomy interferes with the neuroendocrine reflex mediating ovulation rather than delaying sexual receptivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Physiology & Behavior
AB  - 6 female Sprague-Dawley rats served as Ss. The percentages of time spent in wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep remained constant from the beginning of pregnancy until shortly before delivery. For a period of approximately 15 hr. prior to the onset of parturition there was an increased wakefulness and a decrease in both types of sleep. However, REM sleep decreased proportionally more than NREM sleep. During parturition Ss were constantly awake allowing little time for NREM sleep and none for REM sleep. Soon after the end of parturition the amounts of NREM and REM sleep rose quickly to reach levels comparable to those obtained during pregnancy. The significance of these results is described in terms of the hormonal and nonhormonal events occurring at the time of parturition. (15 ref.)

AB  - Reviews the book, Sleep and Dreaming edited by Ernest Hartmann (1970). This book ranges far and wide, although incompletely, as the editor recognizes. It recreates the excitement that has permeated this area of research for the past decade and a half. There are three articles in the present volume which I would especially commend to the reader. Zung's attempt to interrelate the anatomical origin of particular EEG wave forms, brain function, abnormal behavior, drug effect, and drug choice is excellent. It provides one approach to rational drug therapy. Karacan and Williams' use of pregnancy as a paradigm for the long-term interdigitation of sleep-wakefulness relationships may well extend our view and correct our sleep-stage-related myopia Stoyva's essay points the way for the use of verbal report and physiological observation to provide (with Kamiya) a map of consciousness and to treatment possibilities built on conditioning models for a number of conditions, especially those with muscular tension.

AB  - Sleep behavior was studied in 43 70–240 day old Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to protein malnutrition at various stages of development. Dams of experimental Ss were fed 1 of 2 isocaloric diets containing either 25 or 8% casein for 5 wks prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation. After weaning (21 days) the offspring were either maintained on the diet fed their mother or switched to the other diet. Dietary protein restriction, either prior to or following weaning, resulted in a significantly greater proportion of total REM sleep during the dark phase of the 24-hr recording period. Combined preweaning and postweaning restriction produced a somewhat greater effect. None of the malnourished groups differed significantly from the well-nourished control group in amount of waking, slow-wave sleep, or REM sleep in 24 hrs. A control group fed rat chow did not differ from the well-nourished group in any aspects of sleep behavior. Results indicate the possibility of involvement of malnutrition-induced changes in biogenic amine metabolism or endocrine function.

There were 3 prenatal alcohol treatments and 1 control condition: alcohol on Days 1–20, Days 11–20, or Days 1–20 of gestation, or water throughout gestation. LS females took longer than SS females to become pregnant. Fewer LS offspring survived, even when not treated with alcohol. Although LS females tended to consume smaller doses of alcohol, LS offspring consuming alcohol during the 2nd 10 days of gestation survived considerably less than 50% of the time. No such effect was seen in the SS line. Results support those of previous studies indicating a line difference in several aspects of alcohol sensitivity.

AB  - The sleep–waking behavior of a male infant, normal with respect to pregnancy, delivery, and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth for the 1st 4 mo of life. The S was allowed to sleep and awake according to his own schedule and was fed only if his behavior could be judged as a feeding demand. Using several methods of computer analysis it demonstrated that spontaneous sleep–waking behavior was mainly driven by 2 endogenous rhythms—an ultradian cycle and a circadian one. While the ultradian rhythm was already established at term, showing a mean period of 4 hrs, the circadian variation developed during the 1st 3 mo of life. Both rhythms do not run independently, but seem to constitute a system of connected oscillators. As soon as the circadian rhythm is manifestly developed, the period of the ultradian rhythm seems to be modulated according to circadian variations. During the nocturnal phase of the circadian rhythm the ultradian rhythm decelerated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recorded clinical sleep and wakefulness in 31 premature infants throughout 1-3 mo. hospitalizations. Least squares curves were fitted to the data and statistical estimates were made of individual and group rhythms, and of phase relations. Significant 12 and 24 hr. (circadian) sleep rhythms were clearly present. Furthermore, these rhythms were detectable within the 1st 6 days of life in a 19-infant subgroup of gestational ages 5-6.5 mo. The circadian rhythms of individuals were "in phase" with maximal wakefulness between 7 P.M. and 7 A.M. The presence of sleep-wakefulness rhythms in these premature infants suggests that regulating mechanisms for such rhythms exist in the fetus in utero at least by 5-6.5 mo. gestation. Maternal rhythms, e.g., activity cycles, might synchronize such fetal mechanisms to account for phase similarities among individual infants' sleep-wakefulness rhythms.

AB  - Female Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with electrodes for recording EEG, EMG, and EKG data at 26 days of age. Recordings were divided into successive 1-min segments and the predominant sleep-wakefulness (S-W) state in each segment assessed according to characteristic changes in EEG, EMG, and somatic activity. In 5 control Ss, the normal onset of puberty was noted by daily examination for vaginal opening (VO), the 1st sign of the pubertal process in female rats; this usually occurs between 37 and 40 days of age. In a 2nd group of 5 Ss, puberty was precociously induced by subcutaneous injection of pregnant mares' serum (PMS) at 30 days of age. Data from 3 recording periods were examined for each control: at 32 days of age, 2 days before VO, and on the day of VO. For the PMS rats, data were obtained on Day 32 (48-72 hrs after injection). Results demonstrate that puberty in the female rat is accompanied by significant changes in the distribution of each S-W state. Wakefulness was increased, while both quiet sleep and active sleep were decreased at puberty, whether it occurred normally or was precociously induced. The advancement of the pubertal S-W changes by precocious induction of puberty supported the independence of these changes from normal development trends. Instead, changes that occurred during spontaneous or induced puberty resembled those which precede ovulation in the adult ovulatory cycle. It appears that electrophysiological correlates of sleep are affected by changing hormonal levels at these times. (26 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Electroencephalography & Clinical Neurophysiology
AB  - Continuous recording of fetal electrocorticograms, eye and body movements, and heart rate were carried out in the same ewe during late pregnancy and the perinatal period. Alternation of NREM and REM sleep was recorded in 5 fetal lambs as an ultradian rhythm occupying 90% of the time during the 3 wks prior to birth. The period of the rhythm was 30-40 min with a ratio of NREM/REM of 1/1 from 4 mo postconceptional age until 6-8 hrs before birth. Kinesis, particularly the periods of gross activity which accompanied fetal alert wakefulness, was more frequent and more intense during the night. After birth, the total sleep time was reduced to 40% of the recording time; at 1 wk post-partum, the ratio of NREM/REM was 5/1. In the neonate the NREM-REM sleep cycles persisted, but the period was reduced by 50%. Three to five sleep cycles were grouped in episodes of 90-120 min, separated by wakefulness and alimentary behavior. Throughout the experiment, the main criterion for distinguishing alert wakefulness from NREM sleep was oculomotor activity. Wakefulness occupied about 10% of each 24-hr period prepartum and 60% postpartum. (French summary) (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The New England Journal of Medicine
AB  - Describes laboratory studies, psychological evaluations, and management of 9 sleep disorders: somnambulism, night terrors and nightmares, enuresis, narcolepsy, hypersomnia, sleep apnea, insomnia, drug withdrawal insomnia and hypnotic-drug dependence, and medical conditions that manifest themselves during sleep. Sleepwalking tends to occur mostly in males, in children, and in family histories. Etiology is unclear and treatment is focused on protecting the patient from injury. Night terrors are often outgrown when they occur in childhood but may have psychological origins when occurring in adulthood. Enuresis can be primary (continuous) or secondary (intermittent) and the mode of treatment depends on this differential diagnosis. Narcolepsy may have a genetic basis and is treatable with drugs. Hypersomnia, also, is ameliorated by medication. Insomnia, the most common sleep disturbance, is almost always seen as a nonpsychiatric problem by the sufferer and is responsive to medication. Sleep apnea has been implicated in the sudden-infant-death syndrome. Medical conditions that may result in sleep disturbances include coronary artery disease, duodenal ulcer, bronchial asthma, hypothyroidism, and pregnancy.

AU  - Baer, Darius S.
AU  - Crumpacker, David W.
T2  - Behavior Genetics
AB  - The LS (long-sleep) and SS (short-sleep) selected lines of mice exhibit relatively high and low sensitivity to alcohol, respectively, because of their previous history of selective breeding. Findings of the present study identify other differences between the lines. SS females are almost twice as fertile as LS. Analysis of vaginal plug formation suggested that higher sexual activity of the SS strain is an important component of their greater fertility. Forced maternal drinking of a 10% ethanol solution during gestation, and especially during lactation, caused a decrease in survival of LS but not of SS offspring. Increased cannibalism of pups by LS mothers was probably an important component of this decrease in progeny survival. Maternal consumption of liquid in both lines was decreased during gestation, and especially during lactation, when 10% ethanol was the only available liquid in each case. The physiological basis for decreased survival of LS progeny may involve either direct effects of alcohol on progeny or indirect effects caused by water, nutritional, or hormonal imbalance in LS mothers when they are exposed to alcohol stress. The relationship of fertility and progeny survival differences in the 2 lines to their differences in alcohol sensitivity produced by selective breeding is discussed.

AB  - Four groups of Wistar albino rats were given 18 trials, one a day, on the Maier 3-table-test. The groups consisted of a control group (N = 30) of offspring of normal rats, and three groups (N = 33, 30, 34) whose mothers had been dosed respectively with 40, 80, and 120 mgm. per kgm. of body weight per day of sodium bromide from the third through the twentieth day of gestation. All groups by blood test showed a normal concentration of bromide for at least 40 days before experimentation at 106 to 124 days of age. The bromide groups showed significantly poorer "pass" scores, error scores, and time scores, and greater variability of time and error scores than the control group. Differences were not significant between the various bromide groups. Thus bromide dosage of mothers was judged to have a persisting adverse effect on a "higher order nervous process" in their offspring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The child; his origin, development and care.
AB  - This is a college textbook for classes in child development and care, and will also serve as a reference work for lay readers of college caliber. The author has synthesized facts from the appropriate sciences (biochemistry, biology, genetics, psychology, and education) in terms of the phenomena of childhood. Her philosophy is organismic; she views the child as a behaving, integrated organism. Three divisions comprise the text: "Before the Child" has chapters covering such topics as the mechanism of the organization of life, heredity, evolution and anatomy of reproduction, fertility, glands of internal secretion, and pregnancy; "Enter the Child" discusses birth, puerperium, food, sleep, posture, care of head, and health during the baby's first year; and "Development, Behavior and Training" takes up the how and why of behavior, its neural bases, behavior levels of preschool children, learning, moral training, problems of childhood, and the techniques for observing children. References to current works are found in the footnotes. The book is illustrated with pictures, poetry, scientific illustrations and tables of data. It is complete with preface, table of contents, appendices, glossary, and index. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Wimsatt, W. A.
T2  - Journal of Mammalogy
AB  - Hibernating bats of the eastern United States mate during the fall. The spermatozoa are stored in the uterus during the winter and may fertilize ova released from the ovaries in the spring. During hibernation the female is in a state of subestrus. Spermatogenesis occurs only in summer, but the accessory glands remain functional throughout the winter and are filled with masses of mature spermatozoa. If hibernating animals are aroused, they may copulate. Gestation lasts 50-60 days, and parturition occurs near the end of June. Summer colonies of bats are composed almost exclusively of females. The males probably remain isolated during the summer, but in the winter roosts the sexes are more evenly divided, although the true sex ratio is still undetermined.

AB  - Obtained at monthly intervals polygraphic recordings on the last 3 of 5 consecutive nights from 7 mildly retarded pregnant girls. Considerable inter-S as well as intra-S (consecutive nights) variability was observed for most parameters. REM sleep (1-min epochs containing at least 1 REM) decreased, or increased, sometimes dramatically, with total stage 1 remaining remarkably constant. Stage 4 was just as variable as REM sleep. In 2 cases an increase in stage 2 REM was observed near term and becoming most pronounced in the early post partum period. Outstanding in consistency was the increase in stage 4, REM sleep, and increased saturation of REM periods with REMs during early postpartum. Data emphasize the need of more frequent polygraphic studies of indivdual Ss during pregnancy and early postpartum, as well as the need of baseline recordings at least several mo. post term for intra-S correlations.

AB  - From interviews with 199 white couples the author presents data that may be regarded as "an approximate estimate of the average group risk of pregnancy in human beings associated with sexual intercourse between fertile individuals doing nothing to diminish the risk, but motivated in their sex behavior solely by libido, habit and desire for children." The data for frequency of intercourse for the various age groups agree well with earlier figures, and thus tend to establish this as a reasonably normal group with which to investigate the relation between frequency of intercourse and expectation of pregnancy. The number of net potentially effective copulations per pregnancy for all ages of women (up to 50 years) is 254; and the average number of pregnancies per couple is 5.8. The data are broken down in various tables. From them it develops that the mean number of pregnancies per 100 years of exposure to normal intercourse is 76.8, and the median, 57.5.

AU  - Paikin, M. I.
T2  - Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie
AB  - The fact that many investigators consider the pernicious vomiting of pregnancy as a toxicosis, and at the same time recommend psychotherapy for it, leads to the conclusion that the successful use of this treatment does not settle the question in favor of an exclusively psychogenic origin. It may be a reaction of the vegetative nervous system to various injurious agents, either toxins or a pathologically conditioned, i.e., "psychogenic," reflex. The interpretation of psychogenic vomiting during pregnancy as a symbol of rejection is not to be summarily dismissed. It has been known for a long time that suggestion can influence not only the higher functions of the nervous system but also the somatic processes. The conditioned reflex offers a physiological explanation for this. The author reports 11 cases of the toxic vomiting of pregnancy treated by hypnotic suggestion—8 successfully, 2 without result, and one with partial success. Improvement was usually manifest after the first session. In the unsuccessful cases, hypnotic sleep could not be induced; ketonuria was also present. In none of the cases was inquiry made as to psychogenic factors. The author considers, nevertheless, that his results prove that purely symptomatic psychotherapy has an important place in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum.

AB  - Attempted to evaluate the possibility of a humoral, rather than neural, mediation of the epiphenomena of REM sleep. The systemic communication between a mother and her fetus provided a possible approach to this problem. It was assumed that periods of active motility in the fetus of a sleeping mother reflected the occurrence of REM sleep in this organism. Maternal sleep was monitored by standard recording procedures, and fetal sleep was inferred from recordings of intrauterine activity. The following results were obtained from comparisons of all night sleep records of the mother-fetus unit: (1) the fetus tends to develop a recurrent quiet active cycle in the course of gestation; (2) specific instances of high fetal activity frequently occur together with or in close proximity to the recurrent episodes of REM sleep in the mother; and (3) a number of potential mechanisms for a dynamic humoral communication between the 2 physiological units during REM sleep are discussed.

AU  - Bonjour, J.
T2  - Presse Médicale
AB  - The cerebral mechanism plays a part in the act of parturition of an importance hitherto unsuspected, though its action may be understood. The author cites several cases in which suggestion has induced uterine contractions. He asserts that it is possible to bring about, in no more than 2 or 3 treatments, abortion or premature delivery. Delivery has been effected at a predetermined date, by means of the suggestion that the normal term has been completed. Such suggestions act upon the medullary centers; the suggested idea of contractions is carried out in deep hypnosis with the certainty that would attach to a sensory-motor reflex. All the visceral functions are likewise dependent upon psychic mechanisms. It is possible to accelerate or retard menstruation by as much as 8 days in individuals normally regular. The depth of the hypnotic sleep is increased with the duration of gestation; the more closely the woman approaches her full term, the greater is her suggestibility and the more easily she may be put to sleep. The considerable frequency of nocturnal deliveries is not due to the fact of night itself, but to the slumber state, which intensifies the cerebro-spinal reflexes.

AB  - A report is given concerning a couple in their early thirties who had been married 10 years, without issue. Impregnation occurred in a 3-week period following a decision to adopt a baby. Psychoanalytic data are discussed, but no attempt is made to stress the exclusive influence of psychological factors although the psychodynamics are well illustrated.

AB  - Obtained repeated all-night recordings of fetal motility from 4 pregnant females. Small pressure transducers were attached to the abdominal skin over the head, limbs, and buttock of the fetus. An additional transducer was attached to the dorsal surface of the mother's thigh to monitor maternal activity. Ss were recorded from during a normal night of sleep and during periods of quiet wakefulness. Fetal activity was detected from the 5th mo. of pregnancy, and became cyclic during the 6th mo. As measured from the beginning of 1 active period to the beginning of the next, the cycle times at this state of development had a mean of 47.8 26.5 min. Cycle times lengthened progressively, and a significantly longer mean cycle time of 62.7 20 min. was obtained by the 8th mo. This endogenous cyclicity was independent of maternal state, being the same during both sleep and wakefulness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The International Journal of Psychoanalysis
AB  - A young married woman who had a phobia about becoming pregnant developed during her psychoanalysis symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. This patient's associations led her analyst to the conclusion that sleep as a gratification and withdrawal into sleep as a defense played a major part in her symptomatology and character structure. She had a lack of muscular tonus which the analyst understood as an expression of the wish to fall asleep and which he called the "possum defense." Strenuous activity of the limbs that had lacked tonus was believed to be the cause of damage to the patient's joints. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors describe a method for measuring the contractions of the normal uterus by means of string galvanometers. 29 subjects were used, 15 of them free of uterine pathology. Uterine tonus was measured (for the first time in the intact organ) and found to vary in magnitude from subject to subject and from time to time. Spontaneous contractions were recorded repeatedly. The uterine contractions appeared to be relatively independent of the abdominal contractions, though there was slight evidence of a tendency for abdominal muscular contraction to promote uterine activity.

TI  - The reversal by progestin of responses of the non-pregnant uterus of the cat.
AU  - Kennard, J. H.
T2  - American Journal of Physiology
AB  - Stimulation of the cat's hypogastric or injection of adrenine causes relaxation of the uterus in the non-pregnant and contraction of the uterus of the pregnant animal. Similar reversals have been reported from progestin. In this study it was found possible to reverse the nerve response alone if a just minimal amount of progestin was given. Later the adrenine response reversed also (with a larger dose). It is felt that the results are of import to the theories of chemical mediation. Two possibilities are suggested (1) that the substances liberated are different in some slight way (from nerve and adrenine) and (2) that modification of the liberated substance into sympathin I and sympathin E occurs as postulated by Cannon and Rosenblueth and that a difference in the rate of this process and a different sensitivity to progestin in innervated and non-innervated smooth muscle cells accounts for the independent reversal. It is felt that Bacq's theory that sympathin E is a metabolic by-product does not explain the differing reactivity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Ten daily measurements of differences in electrical potential were made during two menstrual cycles of a chimpanzee trained to present both of her hands for application of salt-bridge electrodes (Burr-Hill-Allen technique). These measures, when compared with the curve of genital swelling, show maximal voltage on the 17th day at the beginning of detumescence, which is related to ovulation. In the second menstrual cycle the maximal voltage appears again on the 17th day and is followed by another voltage rise on the 21st day. This second rise is believed to be incident to fertilization and pregnancy, which was shown to have begun at that point. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Ellis, Havelock
T2  - The Journal of Abnormal Psychology
AB  - Presents the dream analysis of a 35-yr-old pregnant woman, to highlight the relation between erotic and vesical dreams. Eight dreams starting from the 4th month of the S's pregnancy were analyzed, and it was revealed that a tendency to menstrual periodicity influenced the causation of erotic dreams. Dreams exhibited the erotic needs of the S clearly. Thus, they were symbolic of the physical sexual phenomena arousing or accompanying the dream. Both vesical and erotic stimuli were present in the dreams. It has been observed that it is more difficult for women than men to achieve sexual satisfaction during sleep. Sexual impulse, which is primary, is regarded as a symbol of urination (vesical impulse), which is secondary. Thus, sexual and vesical impulse are 2 closely allied, yet distinct forces, which may arouse or stimulate the activity of the other. An associative and compensatory relation exists between them.

AB  - This first study of the relationship between the number of pregnancies and the number of children born in the human species employed the records of 6,390 mothers obtained from the Sloane Hospital for Women in New York City. The general result shows that "there is practically no relationship between the number of pregnancies incurred and the relative number brought to term. There seems a slight decrease in the relative number brought to term as the number of pregnancies increases." Specifically: coefficients between pregnancies and children born ranged between +.88 and +.94 for the various nationalities of foreign born women and was +.82 for American born. Coefficients between the number of pregnancies and the deviation of the number brought to term from its probable value were -.2513 ± .0093 for foreign born women and -.4072 ± .007 for American born mothers, showing that the relative number of offspring decreased more rapidly with increase in the number of pregnancies in American born women than in foreign born women. The biological interpretation, that frequent conception so weakens the maternal organism that normal development of the dependent organism is impossible, is probably false, because coefficients between age and number of births and between age and number of pregnancies range between .33 and .70 whereas they would be expected to approach 1.00.

TI  - Lecture XV. Puerperal insanity—Lactational insanity—The insanity of pregnancy.
AU  - Clouston, T. S.
T2  - Clinical lectures on mental diseases.
AB  - Childbirth, nursing, and pregnancy in women are liable to act as the exciting causes of attacks of mental disease. In importance and frequency they stand in the order in which I have placed them. The three forms, though having much in common, yet differ in so many respects that I must take them separately. The advantage and the practical necessity of classifying mental diseases in other ways than according to the mental symptoms present, are especially seen in these three forms of mental disease. To know that a case is one that has begun after recent childbirth is to know far more about it than to know it as mania or melancholia for treatment and for prognosis. PUERPERAL INSANITY—Puerperal insanity is technically limited to the mental disease that occurs within the first six weeks after confinement. By far the majority of the cases, and by far the most acute and characteristic cases, occur within the first fortnight. It is a very common form of mental disease, for five per cent, of all the cases of insanity among women are puerperal, and I think that it is a low estimate that one in every four hundred labors is followed by it. In one-half of the patients the disease begins within the first week after confinement, and in three-fourths of them within the first fortnight. In regard to the cause of the disease, therefore, it is definite and clear. The accompaniments of childbirth produce it. LACTATIONAL INSANITY—Nursing in women is the cause of mental disease sometimes. The poor are more liable to this than the rich, both being equally subject to puerperal insanity. A typical case of lactational insanity is one occurring in the case of a poor woman who has had several children, and has nursed the last for several months, who has got pale and thin in the process, and become subject to headaches, noises in her ears, giddiness, flashes of light before her eyes, lassitude and nervous irritability, in fact to the usual symptoms of general bloodlessness and brain anæmia. She then gets depressed in mind, her sleep leaves her, her self-control is lost, and she becomes either lethargic and stupid or suicidal, with delusions that her husband and neighbors are against her, thereby, poor woman, merely misinterpreting her sensations of mental pain and distress. She had little organic strength for her pregnancy, still less for her delivery, and it has quite broken down in her nursing. To such a woman the organic delight of suckling her infant, for which the maternal nature craves and is satisfied by the process, becomes an irritation, an excitement, and an exhaustion. THE INSANITY OF PREGNANCY—No doubt the alterations are chiefly in the affective faculties, but the reasoning power, the moral sense, the , the imagination, and even the memory, are often enough affected in pregnant women. As a part of the nervous disturbance the bodily appetites become changed, the physiological functions altered, and the nutrition of organs profoundly affected. In this state many women have endless caprices, unfounded dislikes and likings, for foods and drinks never before desired, unnatural desires for indigestible things, causeless weeping and laughing, stealing and lying, morbid thirst and hunger, an activity of digestion never before known, pigmentation of the skin, alteration of the expression of the face, of the tones of the voice, and of the power of muscular coordination.

T2  - American Journal of Orthopsychiatry
AB  - Presents a case report of a five year old Jewish boy with a prolonged hypomanic episode. In addition to a difficulty in using his left arm and leg the mother complained the child suffered severe disturbances of his sleep. The patient was an only child of normal parents. The family history gave no evidence of hereditary nervous disease. Birth had been normal after full-term gestation and the child appeared normal at birth. At 5 months the child had an attack in which he became “like dead” and was cold, quiet and stiff. He was revived and for the next few days was listless and did not cry. It was difficult to feed him but he did not vomit. No inflammatory disease had preceded this episode. At 10 months convulsions set in, which became more frequent until there were several each day. Attack consisted of a definite warning, in which the child called to his mother and pointed to his left hand, the first area to show abnormal movement. He then became unconscious, eyes rolled up, head turned to the left, and body became rigid. There were clonic movements, first of the left hand and arm, then of the left lower extremity; there had never been movements of the right side of the body. Attack usually lasted about five minutes and then he fell into a deep sleep. The occurrence of a hypomanic state with flight of ideas and distractibility in a child of this age is a matter of special interest. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
