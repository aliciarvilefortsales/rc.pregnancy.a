Non-dipper status and preeclampsia are both associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. Complete recovery of BP in PE is reported to occur over a variable period of time. Twenty-four hours-ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in the post-partum follow-up after a PE has not been described. The aim of this study was to assess 24h-ambulatory blood pressure pattern after a PE and to determine the prevalence of non-dipper status, nocturnal hypertension, white coat hypertension and masked hypertension. METHODS: This is an observational, prospective study on women who suffered from a preeclampsia. A 24h-ABPM was done 6 weeks post-partum at the Hypertension Unit of the University Hospitals of Geneva, concomitantly with a clinical and biological evaluation. RESULTS: Forty-five women were included in a preliminary analysis. Mean age was 33±6years, 57.3% were Caucasian, mean BMI before pregnancy was 24±5kg/m(2). Office and ambulatory BP are shown in Table 1. Prevalence of nocturnal hypertension was high and half of the women had no nocturnal dipping. The diagnosis of hypertension based on office BP was discordant with the diagnosis based on ABPM in 25% of women. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of increased nighttime BP and abnormal BP pattern is high at 6weeks post-partum in preeclamptic women. Early assessment of BP with ABPM after preeclampsia allows an early identification of women with persistent circadian abnormalities who might be at increased risk. It also provides a more accurate assessment than office BP. DISCLOSURES: A. Ditisheim: None. B. Ponte: None. G. Wuerzner: None. M. Burnier: None. M. Boulvain: None. A.

Several studies have found that SDB during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy induced hypertension. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between self-reported snoring and neck circumference, weight gain and BMI. METHODS: 2306 pregnant women answered a questionnaire which included 'Do you snore?' among the questions. The women were asked their pre pregnancy weight, current height and weight were used to calculate BMI and change in BMI from pre pregnancy to trial entry, neck circumference was measured, and the Epworth questionnaire for daytime sleepiness was administered. The data from women who answered 'Yes' to the snoring question were compared to that of women who answered No. RESULTS: Pre pregnancy BMI, current BMI and the increase in BMI from pre- pregnancy to current were all highly significantly increased in the women who reported snoring during pregnancy (p<0.0001, <0.0001 and 0.003, respectively). The Epworth sleepiness score, calculated from the Epworth questionnaire, was significantly higher i.e. more daytime sleepiness, in women who reported snoring (p<0.0001) and the neck circumference measurements of women who reported snoring were also highly significantly higher (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Women who report snoring during pregnancy have higher pre pregnancy and current BMI, increase their BMI more during pregnancy, have larger neck circumference and are sleepier during the day. Therefore women who intend to become, or are pregnant, should be encouraged to reduce their BMI and maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy. DISCLOSURES: A.J. Robertson: None. P. Johnson: None.

Why only some women are affected by CVD after severe preeclampsia is not known. The objective of this study was to examine the presence of CVD among women after severe preeclampsia, and illuminate any differences between the women with present CVD and women without CVD. METHODS: Women admitted to Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden with the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia (O141 A, B, C and X) in 1999-2001 were invited to participate. Out of 60 women where the diagnosis was correct, 36 women agreed to participate. Blood pressure, lipids waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) were registered. Participants filled in a form concerning family history, diseases, tobacco, reproduction, physical activity, sleeping patterns, weight change, and marital stress. Family history of CVD was defined as having one first degree relative with stroke, myocardial infarct, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease or diabetes type 2 before the age of 55 (men) and 65 (women). Stress in relation was measured with Stockholm Marital Stress Scale (SMSS) and sleep with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). RESULTS: Ten women were already affected by CVD and 26 were not. Affected women had significantly higher systolic (p=0.001) and diastolic (p=0.001) blood pressure (in spite of medication), BMI (p=0.022) and waist circumference (p=0.003) as well as higher levels of apoB (p=0.017) and lower levels of apoA1 (p=0.015). A difference was also seen in family history of CVD, number of preeclamptic pregnancies, sleep and marital stress but results were not significantly different in this small pilot study. CONCLUSIONS: Constitutional differences when becoming pregnant, number of preeclamptic episodes, obesity, as well as lifestyle may all influence the risk for later CVD. DISCLOSURES: E.G.

SDB is identified by snoring and repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep accompanied by repetitive hypoxia, and has been found to be associated with hypertension, stroke, and heart attack. There is no depth of knowledge examining the association between SDB and pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of self-reported snoring in pregnancy and the potential association between self-reported snoring and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) within a larger cohort from a prevalence of SDB in pregnancy study. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to women attending an outpatient's antenatal clinic. Objective measurements were undertaken. The self-reported snoring is a component of the Epworth scale. Overnight recordings of sleep were attained using SonoMat[TM] (Home Sleep Testing). Pregnancy progression and outcome data were collected on all participants and analysed by IBM SPSS v.20[TM] utilizing chi-square analysis, student T test and logistic regression analysis. HDP diagnoses were in alignment with the SOMANZ (2009) criteria. RESULTS: Questionnaires were administered and outcomes collected on 2309 pregnancies. Snoring was reported in 45.5% of women. Objective measures were attended on 202 women, snoring was recorded at 61%. HDP affected 10.1% of the cohort, 3.3% of whom had preeclampsia. Of the pregnancies affected by self-reported snoring, HDP occurred in 13.4% in comparison to 7.6% of those who do not report snoring (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This indicates an association between self-reported snoring and HDP.

Most investigators of snoring during pregnancy had utilized questionnaires to determine the presence and severity of snoring. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of questionnaires to determine the presence of snoring in pregnant women compared with objectively measured snoring. METHODS: Berlin questionnaires were administered to 202 pregnant women. One question asked 'Do you snore?' Snoring was then recorded in the woman's home using a SonoMat[TM] device, a thin mattress in which sensors measure and record sound and movement. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was determined. The results from the questionnaire were compared to recorded snoring and AHI results. RESULTS: 124 women answered 'Yes' to the question 'Do you snore?' and 78 women answered 'No' and 'I don't know' for score purpose were included in 'No'. The average gestation was 28 ± 7 weeks. Women who reported 'No' were just as likely to report >20% snoring as those who reported 'Yes' (35.5%, p=ns).

For this reason, the authors carried out a population-based case-control study in 11 California counties with ethnically diverse residents. Experienced interviewers spoke in person during a 3-year period in 1997-2000 with the mothers of 185 SIDS cases and 312 randomly selected control subjects. The groups were matched for race/ethnicity and age. The interviewers were trained in grief counseling related specifically to SIDS. Mothers of SIDS cases were more likely than control mothers to be less than 25 years of age, to lack a complete college education, to be unmarried, and to have a lower income. In addition, they had more previous live births, smoked more heavily during the index pregnancy, began prenatal care later, and were likelier to have been physically abused during or after the index pregnancy. Low birth weight, premature birth, and postpartum fever all were more frequent in SIDS infants. After adjusting for known confounding factors and demographic variables, both the prone and side sleeping positions were associated with more than twice the risk of SIDS compared with infants sleeping supine (on their backs). The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were 2.6 and 2.0, respectively, for the prone and side sleeping positions. This association was evident in all racial/ethnic groups. The risk of SIDS was particularly increased for infants placed in an unstable side position and later found to be prone (AOR, 8.7). Infants who usually were placed on their backs but had last been put down in the prone or side position also had a significantly high risk of SIDS (AORs, 8.2 for the prone position and 6.9 for the side position). Infants placed in an unaccustomed prone or side sleeping position were at higher risk than those who always were placed in these positions. This experience with a culturally diverse U.S. population, which follows the 'Back to Sleep' public education campaign, indicates that more emphasis needs to be placed on avoiding an unstable side sleeping position as well as unaccustomed prone and side positions.","2003-09","2019-02-14 12:23:59","2019-02-14 12:23:59","","578-579","","9","58","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","California; Case Control Studies; Female; Interviews; Odds Ratio; Patient Positioning; Sleep; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors -- California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These drugs readily cross the placental barrier, exposing the fetus to increased serotonin levels early in development. This prospective study evaluated infant neurobehavior 14 to 39 hours after birth; all were normal-birth infants. Half the mothers were taking an SSRI. The users and nonusers were matched for cigarette smoking, maternal age, and socioeconomic status. Infants were monitored for behavior, startles, and tremulousness for 1 hour between feedings. Motor activity and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded during a 15-minute sleep period. Behavioral assessment was based on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. The SSRI-exposed infants had shorter gestational ages. They exhibited more motor activity and tremulousness than did unexposed infants and had fewer rhythms in HRV. They also had fewer changes in behavioral state and fewer such states. Peak behavioral state was lower in the exposed infants. These infants also had significantly more rapid-eye-movement sleep and tended to have more spontaneous startles and sudden arousals. After adjusting for gestational age, the only significant differences were in tremulousness and measures of state and sleep organization. Adjusted mean motor activity and spectral peaks in HRV no longer differed significantly between the SSRI-exposed and nonexposed infants. These findings do not support the view that using an SSRI during pregnancy has little effect on the developing fetus. It is possible that the observed changes in motor activity, startles, and HRV are mediated by the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age.","2004-08","2019-02-14 12:23:59","2019-02-14 12:23:59","","564-566","","8","59","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Behavior Rating Scales; Depression -- Drug Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Fetus; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors -- Therapeutic Use -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data on 6483 Bavarian children 5 to 7 years of age were collected in 1999-2000. A self-administered questionnaire concerning maternal smoking was used. The criterion for overweight was a body mass index (BMI) above the 90th percentile, and for obesity, a BMI greater than the 97th percentile. The study population included 3847 children whose mothers reported never having smoked; 638 whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy; and 1998 whose mothers smoked at some time but not during pregnancy.The frequency of overweight children was 8.1% in the never-smoked group, 14.1% when the mother smoked less than 10 cigarettes a day while pregnant, and 17% at a higher level of smoking. The respective figures for childhood obesity were 2.2%, 5.7%, and 8.5%. On bivariate analysis, a high BMI for either parent was the strongest predictor of overweight/obesity, followed by high birth weight and then maternal smoking during pregnancy. Other risk factors included high weight gain in the first year of life, watching TV more than 1 hour per day, snacking while watching TV, early introduction of solid foods, and giving a bottle of milk or tea with carbohydrates to encourage the infant to sleep. Eating alone also increased the risk. Adjusting for parental education lowered the risk associated with watching TV and snacking. On logistic regression analysis, maternal smoking during pregnancy remained a significant risk factor for child overweight and obesity. The respective crude odds ratios were 1.43 and 2.06.In addition to discouraging frequent TV viewing (and video game playing) by children and frequent snacking, it seems reasonable to attempt to persuade pregnant women not to smoke in the interest of their children maintaining normal body weight.","2003-05","2019-02-14 12:24:00","2019-02-14 12:24:00","","297-298","","5","58","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Child; Cross Sectional Studies; Germany; Logistic Regression; Pediatric Obesity -- Risk Factors; Questionnaires; Smoking -- Complications -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 'Back to Sleep' campaign emphasizes, in addition to a supine sleeping position, a safe crib, firm bedding, and avoiding overheating. Nevertheless, the drop in SIDS incidence has been leveling off in recent years. Because a further decline might be possible by altering other risk factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke before and after birth, a physician survey was carried out to clarify knowledge about SIDS and attitudes toward risk reduction. Of 3717 physicians contacted in North Carolina or Washington, DC, 835 (23%) responded. The sample included family and general practitioners, pediatricians, and obstetrician-gynecologists.Nearly 80% of the respondents correctly identified maternal smoking during pregnancy, second-hand exposure to smoke, and prone sleeping as risk factors contributing to SIDS. Only 7% of the group failed to advise a back or side sleep position, and only 5% did not recommend a firm mattress. When asked whether infants required a warmer sleep environment than adults, 26% responded positively. Pediatricians were especially likely to acknowledge the importance of a supine sleep position. A large majority of pediatricians (79%) reported routinely discussing SIDS with parents. The figure for family and general practitioners was only 56%, and for obstetrician-gynecologists, 18%. Only 35% of pediatricians and 15% of family and general practitioners, however, provided written information.Further educational efforts are needed to ensure that physicians who care for infants are aware of the several ways in which the risk of SIDS may be lowered.","2003-01","2019-02-14 12:24:00","2019-02-14 12:24:00","","8-10","","1","58","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; District of Columbia; North Carolina; Passive Smoking; Physician Attitudes; Smoking -- In Pregnancy; Sudden Infant Death -- Prevention and Control; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ICP typically develops in the second half of pregnancy as the result of defective bile acid transport, which leads to the release of liver enzymes and bile acids into the maternal circulation. Itching-the commonest symptom-may interfere with sleep, but in other respects the maternal disorder is benign and does not predispose to liver failure. The fetus, however, is at increased risk of preterm birth, intrauterine demise or stillbirth, and mecomium aspiration.This study compared two drugs, given separately and in combination. Both S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) enhance the excretory function of hepatocytes, stimulate choleretic activity, and dilute toxic bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. UDCA also reduces the accumulation of bile acids in the fetus, and SAMe increases trans-sulfuration of bile acids, which increases their excretion. One or both of these drugs were given to 78 women with singleton pregnancies at less than 36 weeks' gestation who had moderate or severe ICP as evidenced by high self-reported symptom scores. One group of 25 patients received SAMe at a dose of 500 mg twice daily by slow running infusion for 12 days, followed by 500 mg daily by mouth until delivery. Another 26 women received UDCA orally in a dose of 250 mg 3 times a day. The remaining 27 women received both these treatments. The treatment groups were similar obstetrically at the outset.Although all 3 treatments resulted in improvement of maternal symptoms, more women had a favorable response to UDCA alone or in combination with SAMe than to SAMe alone. UDCA given alone or combined with SAMe resulted in greater decreases in the concentrations of bile acids and transaminases compared to SAMe alone, and a favorable response in most women (85% to UDCA alone and 89% to combined therapy). Monotherapy with SAMe did not significantly alter biochemical parameters. Only one patient, treated with UCA alone, became worse. The response was also more rapid-within 7 days of initiating treatment-with UDCA alone or in combination than in SAMe alone, but was fastest with combination therapy. However, by two weeks of therapy there was no difference between the two UDCA groups. There were no significant group differences in the duration of treatment, which ranged from 1 to 12 weeks. All treatments were well tolerated and no adverse side effects were recorded. No perinatal deaths occurred, but premature deliveries before 36 completed weeks of gestation exceeded the population average in all treatment groups. Birth weights below the 10th centile of national growth curves were, however, within the limits of the population average in all groups.UDCA, alone or combined with SAMe, appears to be an effective treatment for ICP. Antepartum and intrapartum monitoring of the fetus should be routine when severe ICP is present.","2007-02","2019-02-14 12:24:00","2019-02-14 12:24:00","","90-92","","2","62","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Bile Acids and Salts; Cholestasis, Intrahepatic -- Drug Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Gastrointestinal Agents -- Therapeutic Use; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Pregnancy Complications -- Risk Factors; Pregnancy Outcomes; Pruritus -- Etiology; S-Adenosylmethionine -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the major cause of postneonatal death, was up to recently the leading cause of infant deaths in American Indian populations. Risk factors for SIDS were sought by reviewing findings from a population-based case-control study of 33 infants who died of SIDS and 66 matched living control infants (the Aberdeen Area Infant Mortality Study). All participants were American Indians living in the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Iowa in the years 1992-1996. The study group included infants dying before 12 months of age but excluded those who died while still hospitalized after delivery.The mean age at death in the SIDS group was 109 days. Univariate analyses showed that parents of SIDS infants had fewer years of education and more often reported fewer than seven prenatal visits. More case mothers had smoked and taken alcohol just before and during pregnancy, and more of them engaged in binge drinking in the first trimester. There was no difference in the use of illicit drugs during pregnancy. Comparable numbers of infants in the case and control groups were put to sleep on their stomachs in the 2 weeks before death. Infants given two or more layers of clothing were at increased risk of SIDS. Those having fewer than three well-baby visits had a nearly 14-fold greater risk of SIDS. Breast-feeding was not a significant factor. On logistic regression analysis, periconceptional drinking remained associated with SIDS (adjusted odds ratio, 6.2). Infants who usually had two or more layers of clothing were also at increased risk, with an identical odds ratio.These findings suggest that controlling alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy could lessen the risk of SIDS in this American Indian population. Attention also should be given to infant clothing, and efforts should be made to promote regular public health nurse visits.","2003-05","2019-02-14 12:24:00","2019-02-14 12:24:00","","306-307","","5","58","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Alcohol Drinking -- In Pregnancy; Clothing; Infant; Iowa; Native Americans; Nebraska; North Dakota; South Dakota; Sudden Infant Death -- Ethnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is possible that the way in which labor onset is experienced influences the duration of labor and other aspects of labor dynamics. The authors administered a semistructured questionnaire to 235 women who were admitted at term in spontaneous labor. They were asked about when labor had begun, how they became aware of it, and whether and when the membranes had ruptured. Two investigators independently subdivided women's experience of labor onset into 369 sampling units corresponding to 8 predefined categories. Each unit consisted of a sentence, phrase, or expression embodying a single meaning. Interrater agreement on categorizing sampling units was 0.91. Nearly two thirds of all units related to recurrent or nonrecurring forms of pain. Most women experienced the onset of labor as regular or irregular recurring pain. Multiparous women reported recurrent pain more often than nulliparas. For most parameters, including watery fluid, gastrointestinal symptoms, and altered sleep, the number of women was identical to the number of sampling units. Sixteen women reported 22 units relating to emotional reactions. One third of women (33.6%) had membrane rupture before being admitted but only 21.6% associated it with the onset of labor. Women describe a wide range of symptoms and signs as heralding the onset of labor. No standardized experience of labor onset was found in this inquiry. A woman's perception of labor onset could well be as reliable as any surrogate measure. Rather than asking parturients about when contractions began and when they became regular, caregivers should ask them when labor began and how they knew.","2004-07","2019-02-14 12:24:01","2019-02-14 12:24:01","","500-502","","7","59","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Interrater Reliability; Labor -- Psychosocial Factors; Women -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we take the contemporary concern with age as a starting point from which to historicise and contextualise the concept of maternity risk. To this end, we examine maternal hygiene manuals (self-help guidebooks on motherhood and pregnancy) published between 1880 and 1920 in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis of these manuals indicated that pregnancy during this period was presented as a potentially dangerous affair that required constant surveillance by the self (and others) to ensure favourable pregnancy outcomes. A dominant theme that emerged from the manuals was that the expectant mother was morally responsible for mitigating a range of risk factors, including adequate exercise, sleep, fresh air, as well as for choosing an appropriate father and ensuring his health. At the same time, the manuals indicated that the failure to seek out expert advice and take up responsible practices was linked to adverse consequences for the expectant mother’s health, and her newborn’s health and moral character later in life. We conclude this article by discussing how findings from our historical data can provide an important context for understanding risk discourses around pregnancy as historically specific and culturally contingent, especially with respect to risks associated with maternal advanced age.","2014-01","2019-02-14 12:24:01","2019-02-14 12:24:01","","7-21","","1","16","","Health, Risk & Society","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Attitude to Risk; Books; Canada; Discourse Analysis; Expectant Mothers; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge; History of Medicine; Morals; Pregnancy Complications; Sexuality; United Kingdom; United States; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: Defined by cyclical patterns of circulating hormones, the reproductive system is vulnerable to shifts in circadian rhythms, either through sleep disturbances, altered melatonin production, exposure to light at night, or some other mechanism. Several occupational groups, including health care workers, law enforcement, firefighters, and manufacturing workers are required to work night shifts. Worldwide, millions work at least one night per month. RESULTS: Research will be reviewed on shift work and reproductive outcomes, including menstrual cycle patterns, fertility, pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, and birth weight. The limitations of current research will also be discussed: is there a dose response effect from the number of years of shift work, or can the effects be reversed once shift work stops? Are there different effects from permanent night shift versus rotating shift involving nights? CONCLUSIONS: Future research needs will be identified, including the need for validation of self-reported shift work data and the mechanisms by which shift work affects reproductive health. Recommendations for shift workers and employers will be explored.","2014-06-02","2019-02-14 12:24:02","2019-02-14 12:24:02","","A122-A122","","","71","","Occupational & Environmental Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We wanted to determine whether these and other occupational exposures were associated with spontaneous abortion among female flight attendants. METHOD: Female flight attendants from three US airlines in three cities were interviewed. Company records of over 1.9 million individual flights during the study period were assessed for exposure to galactic cosmic radiation, solar particle event radiation, and circadian disruption. Measures of physical job demands and other occupational factors were obtained from the interview. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for age, parity, and nonflying status. RESULTS: Among 2273 women interviewed, 840 pregnancies among 673 women met inclusion criteria. There was evidence to suggest that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion in weeks 9-13 of the first trimester (odds ratio (OR)=1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-3.20). The risk of a first trimester spontaneous abortion was significantly increased with 15 h or more of flying during home base normal sleep hours (OR=1.54; 95% CI 1.07-2.21) and with high physical job demands (OR=2.49; 95% CI 1.49-4.16). CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous abortion was associated with several flight attendant occupational exposures. This is the first report of these associations based on a quantitative assessment of distinct exposures generated from individual flight records.","2014-06-02","2019-02-14 12:24:02","2019-02-14 12:24:02","","A49-A49","","","71","","Occupational & Environmental Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards breast-feeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses.","2008-03","2019-02-14 12:24:05","2019-02-14 12:24:05","","64-71","","1","22","","Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Interviews; Infant; Adult; Human; Attitude to Breast Feeding; Audiorecording; Childbirth -- Psychosocial Factors; Coding; Constant Comparative Method; Convenience Sample; Fatherhood -- Psychosocial Factors; Fathers; Funding Source; Grounded Theory; Infant, Newborn; Life Experiences; Life Style Changes; Male; Marriage; Middle Age; Parent-Infant Bonding; Parental Attitudes; Parental Role; Sweden; Validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.","2012-08-02","2019-02-14 12:24:06","2019-02-14 12:24:06","","S83-8","","","18","","American Journal of Managed Care","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Funding Source; Restless Legs; Restless Legs -- Chemically Induced; Restless Legs -- Diagnosis; Restless Legs -- Drug Therapy; Restless Legs -- Epidemiology; Restless Legs -- Etiology; Restless Legs -- Familial and Genetic; Restless Legs -- Physiopathology; Restless Legs -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: A convenience sample of 150 second-trimester and 150 thirdtrimester pregnant women was recruited from two medical centers in Taiwan. A comparison group of 300 nonpregnant women was recruited by the acquaintance technique. Data were collected from October 2006 to September 2007 using a demographic form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Findings: The prevalence of poor sleepers (PSQI score>5) was 60.0% for second- and third-trimester pregnant women and 48.0% for nonpregnant women. After controlling for significant covariates, pregnant women reported worse global sleep quality, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disturbances than nonpregnant women, and poorer sleep quality and sleep latency were most prevalent during their third trimester. A high prevalence of antenatal depression (27.3% to 36.0%) was found in pregnant women, depressed women had worse sleep quality than nondepressed women in all groups, and stress affected sleep quality in pregnant women but not in nonpregnant women. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women suffer significantly more poor sleep quality than nonpregnant women, and that sleep quality of pregnant women was related to stress and depression. Clinical Relevance: Evaluation for sleep quality and depression should be part of routine prenatal check-ups. Information on women's sleep quality, stress, and depressive status can be used to individualize interventions for pregnancy-associated sleep disorder.","2010","2019-02-14 12:24:06","2019-02-14 12:24:06","","23-30","","1","42","","Journal of Nursing Scholarship","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Age Factors; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Analysis of Covariance; Coefficient Alpha; Comparative Studies; Depression -- In Pregnancy -- Taiwan; Depression -- Taiwan; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Employment; Information Resources; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Psychological Tests; Scales; Self Report; Sleep -- In Pregnancy -- Taiwan; Sleep -- Taiwan; Stress, Psychological -- In Pregnancy -- Taiwan; Stress, Psychological -- Taiwan; Summated Rating Scaling; T-Tests; Taiwan; World Wide Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were collected by mailed questionnaires: (a) the Demographic Data Form; (b) the Bereavement Experience Questionnaire; and (c) the Health Change Questionnaire. Subjects were 32 Caucasian and 16 African-American women who had delivered a stillborn infant between 32 and 44 weeks gestation. The two groups were compared according to obstetrical history, general health change, number of physician visits, presentation of physical health problems and somatic symptoms, drug usage, sleep problems, appetite and weight changes, exercise patterns, and grief responses following their stillbirth experience. The findings indicated that more of the Caucasian subjects were married and living with their husbands, employed and reported more years of education as compared to the African-American subjects. There were no statistically significant differences between the Caucasian and African-American subjects in their responses to grief. The two groups did not differ significantly according to reported overall health changes, physical health problems and somatic symptoms. However, the African-American women reported significantly more sleep problems, greater severity of health problems and an increase in the usage of recreational drugs. The African-American women also reported a greater percentage of changes in appetite and weight however there were no reported differences in exercise patterns between the two groups.","1991-01","2019-02-14 12:24:07","2019-02-14 12:24:07","","","139 p","","","","","","","","","","OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY","","","","","c8h","UMI Order PUZ9120740","EBSCOhost","","PH.D.","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Marital Status; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Comparative Studies; Research Instruments; Educational Status; Ethnic Groups; Grief; Health Status -- In Pregnancy; Perinatal Death -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy.Methods: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman's Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables.Results: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance.Conclusions: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that cannot.","2016-05-18","2019-02-14 12:24:07","2019-02-14 12:24:07","","1-8","","","16","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Young Adult; Polysomnography; Pregnancy Complications -- Diagnosis; Pregnancy Trimester, Third -- Physiology; Pregnancy Trimester, Third -- Psychosocial Factors; Research Subjects; Self Diagnosis; Self Report -- Standards; Sleep -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been argued that road traffic noise could be linked to adiposity through its influence on sleep and stress. Few studies, to our knowledge, have investigated whether noise and adiposity are associated. Most of them were on adults, and we are not aware of any longitudinal study using repeated measures.Objectives: The present longitudinal study investigated whether road traffic noise exposures in pregnancy (N = 6,963; obs = 22,975) or childhood (N = 6,403; obs = 14,585) were associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories in children.Methods: We obtained information on BMI and covariates from questionnaires used in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, Statistics Norway, and Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We modeled road traffic noise for the most exposed façade of children's present and historical addresses at 6 time points from pregnancy to age 8. We investigated effects on BMI trajectories using repeated measures and linear mixed models.Results: The results indicated that BMI curves depended on road traffic noise exposure during pregnancy, but not on exposure during childhood. Children in the highest decile of traffic noise exposure had increased BMI, with 0.35 kg/m more than children in the lowest decile, from birth to age 8 years.Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure to road traffic noise during pregnancy may be associated with children's BMI trajectories. Future studies should investigate this further, using anthropometric measures such as waist-hip ratio and skinfold thickness, in addition to BMI.","2018-09","2019-02-14 12:24:07","2019-02-14 12:24:07","","729-738","","5","29","","Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sleep patterns change during pregnancy, but prospective data are limited on their relation to gestational diabetes.Objective: We sought to prospectively examine the trimester-specific (first and second trimester) association between typical sleep duration in pregnancy and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes, as well as the influence of compensatory daytime napping on this association.Study Design: In the prospective, multiracial Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort, 2581 pregnant women reported their typical sleep duration and napping frequency in the first and second trimesters. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes (n = 107; 4.1%) was based on medical records review. Adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for gestational diabetes were estimated with Poisson regression, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy body mass index, and other risk factors.Results: From the first and second trimester, sleep duration and napping frequency declined. Sleeping duration in the second but not first trimester was significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes. The association between second-trimester sleep and gestational diabetes differed by prepregnancy obesity status (P for interaction = .04). Among nonobese but not obese women, both sleeping >8-9 hours or <8-9 hours were significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes: 5-6 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-4.99); 7 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.68); or ≥10 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.67). Significant effect modification by napping frequency was also observed in the second trimester (P for interaction = .03). Significant and positive association between reduced sleep (5-7 hours) and gestational diabetes was observed among women napping rarely/never (adjusted relative risk, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.13), whereas no comparable associations were observed among women napping most/sometimes.Conclusion: Our data suggest a U-shaped association between sleep duration and gestational diabetes, and that napping and prepregnancy obesity status may modify this association.","2017-04","2019-02-14 12:24:08","2019-02-14 12:24:08","","399.e1-399.e8","","4","216","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Adult; Human; United States; Funding Source; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Time Factors; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Epidemiology; Obesity -- Epidemiology; Population; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Relative Risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to test the hypothesis that mild IVF treatment can achieve the same chance of a pregnancy resulting in term livebirth within 1 year compared with standard treatment, and can also reduce patients' discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and costs.Methods: We did a randomised, non-inferiority effectiveness trial. 404 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] antagonist co-treatment combined with single embryo transfer) or a standard treatment (stimulation with a GnRH agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos). Primary endpoints were proportion of cumulative pregnancies leading to term livebirth within 1 year after randomisation (with a non-inferiority threshold of -12.5%), total costs per couple up to 6 weeks after expected date of delivery, and overall discomfort for patients. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN35766970.Findings: The proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term livebirth after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment (absolute number of patients=86 for both groups). The lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI was -9.8%. The proportion of couples with multiple pregnancy outcomes was 0.5% with mild IVF treatment versus 13.1% (p<0.0001) with standard treatment, and mean total costs were 8333 euros and 10745 euros, respectively (difference 2412 euros, 95% CI 703-4131). There were no significant differences between the groups in the anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, or sleep quality of the mother.Interpretation: Over 1 year of treatment, cumulative rates of term livebirths and patients' discomfort are much the same for mild ovarian stimulation with single embryos transferred and for standard stimulation with two embryos transferred. However, a mild IVF treatment protocol can substantially reduce multiple pregnancy rates and overall costs.","2007-03-03","2019-02-14 12:24:08","2019-02-14 12:24:08","","743-749","","9563","369 North American Edition","","Lancet","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; Human; Treatment Outcomes; Clinical Trials; Cost Benefit Analysis; Embryo Transfer; Fertilization in Vitro -- Economics; Fertilization in Vitro -- Methods; Gonadorelin; Gonadorelin -- Antagonists and Inhibitors; Infertility -- Therapy; Ovary -- Drug Effects; Patient Satisfaction; Pregnancy, Multiple","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The results of a prospective case-control study, of 203 cases of SIDS, and 622 control infants are presented. All variables significant on univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model analysed in nine stages, starting with sociodemographic variables, then sequentially and cumulatively adding variables relating to pregnancy history, current pregnancy, birth, the interval from birth to the week prior to death, the last week, the last 48 hours, and the last sleep period. A ninth stage was created by adding placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period. RESULTS: As additional variables are added, previously published SIDS risk factors emerged such as social deprivation, young maternal age, > or =3 previous live births, maternal smoking and drinking, urinary tract infection in pregnancy, reduced birth weight, and the infant having an illness, regurgitation, being sweaty, or a history of crying/colic in the interval from birth to the week before death, with co-sleeping and the lack of regular soother use important in the last sleep period. As the model progressed through stages 1-9, many significant variables became non-significant (social deprivation, young maternal age, maternal smoking and drinking) and in stage 9 the addition of placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period caused > or =3 previous live births and a reduced birth weight to become significant.

The purpose of this study is to describe a collaborative team-based care model in which clinical pharmacists work with primary care providers (PCPs) to improve the safe use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and sleep disorders and to assess the preliminary results of the impact of the clinical service on patient outcomes. Methods: Adult patients were eligible if they received care from the academic primary care clinic, were prescribed a benzodiazepine chronically, and were not pregnant or managed by psychiatry. Outcomes included baseline PCP confidence and knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine use, patient symptom severity, and medication changes. Results: Twenty-five of 57 PCPs responded to the survey. PCPs reported greater confidence in diagnosing and treating generalized anxiety and panic disorders than sleep disorder and had variable knowledge of appropriate benzodiazepine prescribing. Twenty-nine patients had at least 1 visit. Over 44 total patient visits, 59% resulted in the addition or optimization of a nonbenzodiazepine medication and 46% resulted in the discontinuation or optimization of a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety symptom severity scores significantly improved (−2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): −3.57 to −0.43). Conclusion: Collaborative team-based models that include clinical pharmacists in primary care can assist in optimizing high-risk benzodiazepine use. Although these findings suggest improvements in safe medication use and symptoms, additional studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.","2017-08","2019-02-14 12:24:09","2019-02-14 12:24:09","","425-433","","4","30","","Journal of Pharmacy Practice","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Adult; Outpatients; Antianxiety Agents, Benzodiazepine; Anxiety; Anxiety -- Symptoms; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Pharmacists; Primary Health Care; Sleep Disorders; Students, Pharmacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background.- There has been a dramatic increase in opioid administration over the past 25 years, with limited evidence of efficacy for either pain reduction or increased function, and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including headache chronification. To date, there has been no consensus on headache-specific guidelines for selecting patients for COT, physician requirements, and treatment monitoring. Methods.- A multidisciplinary committee of physicians and allied health professionals with extensive experience and expertise in the administration of opioids to headache patients, undertook a review of the available evidence from the research and clinical literature (using the PubMed database for articles through December 2009) to develop headache-specific treatment recommendations. This guide reflects the opinions of its authors and is not an official document of the American Headache Society. Results.- The guide identifies factors that would qualify or disqualify the use of COT, including, determination of intractability prior to initiating COT, requisite experience of the prescriber, and requirements for a formal monitoring system to assess appropriate use, safety, efficacy, and functional impact. An appendix reviews the available evidence for efficacy of COT in chronic headache and noncancer pain, paradoxical effects (opioid-induced hyperalgesia, medication overuse headache, opioid-related reduction in triptan and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug efficacy), other adverse effects (nausea and constipation, insomnia and sleep apnea, respiratory depression and sudden cardiac death, reductions in sex hormones, issues during pregnancy, neurocognitive functioning), and issues related to comorbid psychiatric disorders. Conclusions.- Only a select and very limited group (estimate of 10-20%) of refractory headache patients who meet criteria for COT respond with convincing headache reduction and functional improvement over the long-term. Conservative and empirically based guidelines will help identify those patients for whom a COT trial may be appropriate, while protecting their welfare and safety.","2010-08-07","2019-02-14 12:24:10","2019-02-14 12:24:10","","1175-1193","","7","50","","Headache: The Journal of Head & Face Pain","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Comorbidity; Drug Interactions; Headache -- Drug Therapy; Narcotics -- Administration and Dosage; Narcotics -- Adverse Effects; Narcotics -- Therapeutic Use; Patient Selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We designed a prospective longitudinal study to investigate the correlates of WED/RLS during and after pregnancy.Design: A total of 138 pregnant women with WED/RLS and a control group of 251 age-matched pregnant women were enrolled prospectively. A questionnaire was administered during a face-to-face interview at first evaluation during pregnancy and three months after delivery.Results: Among all women in the first trimester, 15.6% were diagnosed with WED/RLS, whereas 32.8% of those in the second trimester and 38.8% of those in the third trimester were diagnosed with WED/RLS (p = 0.032). In regression analysis, later gestational age [p < 0.001; odds ratio (OR) 1.054] and previous history of WED/RLS (p = 0.001; OR 2.795) were positively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS, while ferritin levels (p = 0.001; OR 0.956) were negatively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS. Ferritin levels were also negatively correlated with the International RLS Study Group severity index (p = 0.041). Forty-eight patients (34.8%) experienced WED/RLS symptomatology after delivery. The ferritin levels were lower, and the mean number of pregnancies was higher, in women with residual WED/RLS (p = 0.008).Conclusion: Our survey showed that WED/RLS was more common in the second and third trimesters. Emergence of WED/RLS during the second trimester was strongly associated with residual WED/RLS. Lower ferritin levels were associated with both WED/RLS in pregnancy and residual WED/RLS after delivery. A higher number of pregnancies were also associated with a greater likelihood of having residual WED/RLS after delivery.","2015-09","2019-02-14 12:24:10","2019-02-14 12:24:10","","1036-1040","","9","16","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intervention group underwent a six-session couple-separated psycho-educational program; the control group received the usual care. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at late pregnancy (>28 weeks), 3 days postpartum, and 42 days postpartum. The intervention group had a significantly lower cesarean rate and shorter third stage of labor ( p < .05). At 42 days after delivery, only 5.1% of participants were lost to follow-up, and the intervention group had significantly less minor and major depression, more sleep time, more satisfaction with their husband and other family members, less concern about taking care of baby, and less breast milk insufficiency than the control group ( p < .05).

A retrospective study was done to determine the prevalence of infant bed-sharing and its associations in a clinical practice. Demographic data were collected from 2,405 infants from a large family practice residency program, which included OB care, in Missouri between March 2002 and February 2008. Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the first four well-child visits: 1 month, 2-3 months, 4-5 months, and 6-8 months of age. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package, version 12.0 and 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). At the first, second, third, and fourth well-child visit 19, 18, 12, and 11% of infants bed-shared with an adult. Bed-sharing was associated with an infant missing one or more well-child visits (first and third visits only), breastfeeding (first and second well-child visits only), and low SES. Stratified analysis by residence showed that over the 6-year study the decrease in the rate of bed-sharing, in the urban and non-urban areas, was statistically significant ( P = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). Infants born 2006-2007 had a decreased rate of bed-sharing compared to infants born 2002-2005 (0.22, 0.30, respectively, P = 0.00). In light of the high rate of bed-sharing recorded at the first well-child visit, the researchers recommend an increased emphasis on safe sleeping education during the third trimester of pregnancy.","2011-05","2019-02-14 12:24:45","2019-02-14 12:24:45","","507-513","","4","15","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Human; Age Factors; Convenience Sample; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; T-Tests; Record Review; American Academy of Pediatrics; Bed Sharing -- Epidemiology -- Missouri; Demography; Electronic Health Records; Health Status; Infant Care; Missouri; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Retrospective Design; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although typically a common practice for nonpregnant adults, this is not the case for the thousands of pregnant women who also report substantial sleep issues. Unfortunately, a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this population, scant empiric evidence regarding the appropriateness of prescribing options, and the concern of subsequent teratogenicity restricts the ability of clinicians to make informed decisions. We synthesized the current research regarding hypnotics and sedating medications used (both on- and off-label) during pregnancy and their association with adverse outcomes. Medications that we investigated included benzodiazepines, hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihistamines. Overall, the examined studies showed no correlation of increased risk of congenital malformations. However, benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists may increase rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and/or small-for-gestational-age infants. The small number of studies and the small number of subjects prohibit any definitive interpretation regarding the consequences of the use of hypnotic or sedating medications in pregnancy. Additional case reports, randomized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies are needed urgently.","2015-04","2019-02-14 12:24:45","2019-02-14 12:24:45","","428-441","","4","212","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced -- Etiology; Childbirth, Premature -- Chemically Induced; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- Adverse Effects; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- Therapeutic Use; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Insomnia -- Drug Therapy; Pregnancy Complications -- Drug Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea increases along with body mass index, age and in the presence of other co-morbidities. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea in women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities; recent studies suggest that women with obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy may be at significantly greater risk of entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension and/or of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: gestational hypertension; preeclampsia; or eclampsia. This has serious public health implications; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and are associated with a greater lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms that associated obstructive sleep apnea with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not been defined, but several pathways are scientifically plausible. In this review, we will present a comprehensive literature review of the following: the associations between obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the proposed mechanisms that may connect obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and the effectiveness of treatment at mitigating these adverse outcomes.","2018-12","2019-02-14 12:24:45","2019-02-14 12:24:45","","37-46","","","42","","Sleep Medicine Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Physiopathology; Gestational Age; Obesity; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Physiopathology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Diagnosis; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Epidemiology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested a Facebook peer-group intervention for low-income mothers to foster behaviors promoting healthy infant growth. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 87 pregnant women (Medicaid insured, BMI ≥25 kg/m2) were randomized to the Grow2Gether intervention or text message appointment reminders. Grow2Gether participants joined a private Facebook group of 9-13 women from 2 months before delivery until infant age 9 months. A psychologist facilitated groups featuring a curriculum of weekly videos addressing feeding, sleep, parenting, and maternal well-being. Feasibility was assessed using the frequency and content of participation, and acceptability using surveys. Maternal beliefs and behaviors and infant growth were assessed at birth, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months. Differences in infant growth between study arms were explored. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using quasi-least-squares regression. Results: Eighty-eight percent (75/85) of intervention participants (42% (36/85) food insecure, 88% (75/85) black) reported the group was helpful. Participants posted 30 times/group/week on average. At 9 months, the intervention group had significant improvement in feeding behaviors (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire) compared to the control group ( p = 0.01, effect size = 0.45). Intervention group mothers were significantly less likely to pressure infants to finish food and, at age 6 months, give cereal in the bottle. Differences were not observed for other outcomes, including maternal feeding beliefs or infant weight-for-length. Conclusions: A social media peer-group intervention was engaging and significantly impacted certain feeding behaviors in families with infants at high risk of obesity.","2017-10","2019-02-14 12:24:46","2019-02-14 12:24:46","","356-368","","5","13","","Childhood Obesity","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Body Mass Index; Child; Infant; Adult; Human; Expectant Mothers; Descriptive Statistics; Randomized Controlled Trials; Socioeconomic Factors; Infant Feeding; Internet; Maternal Attitudes; Pediatric Obesity -- Prevention and Control; Peer Group; Psychology; Social Media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods: In this descriptive-correlational study, 425 pregnant women, visiting Islamabad and Ravansar-based prenatal care centers (randomly selected from the townships of Kermanshah Province (Iran)) in 2015, were selected. To collect the required data, the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test (LWSMAT), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RIS), Zimet's Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and depression, anxiety and stress scales were used. Results: The results of data analysis demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between the quality of sleep and variables like depression, anxiety, stress, perception, social support and marital adjustment. Further, the results showed that the hierarchical regression of all variables could predict 31% of the changes of sleep quality. Additionally, anxiety, depression and stress were ranked first, second and third in terms of the shares of variables in predicting the quality of sleep. Whereas, resilience, perceived social support and marital adjustment were unable to predict the quality of sleep. Conclusion: Given the results of the present study, it is suggested that the roles of the psychological factors be considered in improving the quality of sleep among pregnant women.","2018-03","2019-02-14 12:24:47","2019-02-14 12:24:47","","17-24","","1","20","","Sleep & Hypnosis","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Descriptive Research; Human; Scales; Correlational Studies; Adaptation, Psychological -- In Pregnancy; Anxiety Disorders -- In Pregnancy; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Hardiness -- In Pregnancy; Iran; Regression; Sleep -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Pregnancy; Stress, Psychological -- In Pregnancy; Support, Psychosocial -- In Pregnancy; Variable","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women pregnant in the last 12 months were asked about their age, parity, education, use of nets, ITN, antenatal care (ANC) services and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (overall and for IPT) during pregnancy. Homestead assets were recorded and used to develop a wealth index. Travel time to ANC clinics was computed using a geographic information system algorithm. Predictors of net and IPT use were defined using multivariate logistic regression.Results: Overall 68% of pregnant women used a net; 52% used an ITN; 84% attended an ANC clinic at least once and 74% at least twice. Fifty-three percent of women took at least one dose of IPT-SP, however only 22% took two or more doses. Women from the least poor homesteads (OR = 2.53, 1.36-4.68) and those who used IPT services (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.42) were more likely to sleep under any net. Women who used IPT were more likely to use ITNs (OR = 1.35, 1.03-1.77), while those who lived more than an hour from an ANC clinic were less likely (OR = 0.61, 0.46-0.81) to use ITN. Women with formal education (1.47, 1.01-2.17) and those who used ITN (OR: 1.68, 1.20-2.36) were more likely to have received at least one dose of IPT-SP.Conclusion: Although the use of ITN had increased 10-fold and the use of IPT fourfold since last measured in 2001, coverage remains low. Provider practices in the delivery of protective measures against malaria must change, supported by community awareness campaigns on the importance of mothers' use of IPT.","2008-02","2019-02-14 12:24:48","2019-02-14 12:24:48","","208-217","","2","13","","Tropical Medicine & International Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Pregnancy; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Middle Age; Surveys; Prenatal Care; Antimalarials -- Administration and Dosage; Antimalarials -- Therapeutic Use; Bedding and Linens; Drug Combinations; Health Care Delivery -- Methods; Health Services Accessibility; Insecticides -- Administration and Dosage; Kenya; Malaria -- Prevention and Control; Pest Control; Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic -- Prevention and Control; Pyrimethamine -- Administration and Dosage; Pyrimethamine -- Therapeutic Use; Rural Population; Sulfadoxine -- Administration and Dosage; Sulfadoxine -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data. RESULTS: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r > or = 0.80) when 3 days of data were used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.","2009-08-07","2019-02-14 12:24:48","2019-02-14 12:24:48","","256-260","","4","34","","MCN: The American Journal of Maternal Child Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Cross Sectional Studies; Infant; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Information Resources; World Wide Web; Time Factors; Infant Feeding; Analysis of Variance; Crying; Diaries; Mothers; Repeated Measures; Sleep -- In Adulthood; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it remains unclear whether current evidence is rigorous enough to support acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for insomnia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), the World Health Organization (WHO) Trials Portal (ICTRP) and relevant specialised registers of the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2011. We screened reference lists of all eligible reports and contacted trial authors and experts in the field. Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture for insomnia. They compared acupuncture with/without additional treatment against placebo or sham or no treatment or same additional treatment. We excluded trials that compared different acupuncture methods or acupuncture against other treatments. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used odds ratio (OR) and mean difference for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. We combined data in meta-analyses where appropriate. Thirty-three trials were included. They recruited 2293 participants with insomnia, aged 15 to 98 years, some with medical conditions contributing to insomnia (stroke, end-stage renal disease, perimenopause, pregnancy, psychiatric diseases). They evaluated needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, acupressure or magnetic acupressure.Compared with no treatment (two studies, 280 participants) or sham/placebo (two studies, 112 participants), acupressure resulted in more people with improvement in sleep quality (compared to no treatment: OR 13.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 95.59; compared to sham/placebo: OR 6.62, 95% CI 1.78 to 24.55). However, when assuming that dropouts had a worse outcome in sensitivity analysis the beneficial effect of acupuncture was inconclusive. Compared with other treatment alone, acupuncture as an adjunct to other treatment might marginally increase the proportion of people with improved sleep quality (13 studies, 883 participants, OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.90). On subgroup analysis, only needle acupuncture but not electroacupuncture showed benefits. All trials had high risk of bias and were heterogeneous in the definition of insomnia, participant characteristics, acupoints and treatment regimen. The effect sizes were generally small with wide confidence intervals. Publication bias was likely present. Adverse effects were rarely reported and they were minor. Due to poor methodological quality, high levels of heterogeneity and publication bias, the current evidence is not sufficiently rigorous to support or refute acupuncture for treating insomnia. Larger high-quality clinical trials are required.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]","2012-09","2019-02-14 12:24:49","2019-02-14 12:24:49","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","9","","","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Human; Treatment Outcomes; Descriptive Statistics; Relative Risk; Clinical Trials; Confidence Intervals; Acupuncture; Acupressure; Insomnia -- Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A group of 51 conventionally treated pregnant women (with counselling by their physicians and nurses) was allocated by chance into two groups to be either treated or not by acupuncture. Both groups (28 in the study group and 23 in the control group) presented emotional complaints such as anxiety, depression and irritability. They reported the severity of symptoms using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10; and they rated how much the symptoms disturbed five aspects of their lives: mood, sleep, relationships, social activities, sexual life and joy of living. Traditional acupuncture was used. In order to facilitate protocols we used pre-programmed points. Up to four points were permitted as optional points. RESULTS: Three women from the acupuncture group and four from the control group dropped out of the study. Over the study period, the NRS scores of intensity of emotional distress decreased by at least half in 15/25 (60%) of patients in the study group and in 5/19 (26%) of those in the control group (P=0.013). The impact of the distress on three out of the five aspects of life was significantly less in the acupuncture group when compared with the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Emotional complaints are very common in pregnancy and medication is always a risk. In this study, acupuncture seems to be an efficacious means of reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life of women with emotional complaints during pregnancy. Large randomised studies are recommended to confirm these results.","2007-09","2019-02-14 12:24:50","2019-02-14 12:24:50","","65-71","","3","25","","Acupuncture in Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Fetus; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Brazil; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Fisher's Exact Test; Scales; T-Tests; Acupuncture -- In Pregnancy; Kruskal-Wallis Test; Alternative Therapies; Anger -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Anxiety -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Counseling -- In Pregnancy; Depression -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Intervention Trials; Patient Attitudes -- In Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Psychiatric -- Therapy; Quality of Life -- In Pregnancy; Statistical Significance; Treatment Outcomes -- In Pregnancy; Women's Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conceptual framework was derived from Roy's four modes of adaptation which were operationalized to incorporate the independent and dependent variables. A descriptive correlational design was used, and instruments used in data collection included: Rosenberg's self-esteem scale, Loevinger's Washington University Sentence Completion Test (form 81), Lakin's Modified Thematic Apperception Test, Erickson's Pregnancy Symptom Checklist, and the Price Assessment of Maternal-infant Sensitivity Scale. Data were collected, using a non-random purposive sampling, over an 18 month period. The sample included 70 subjects who were scheduled to deliver at a major Boston teaching hospital. During the second trimester of pregnancy, the subjects completed the self-esteem scale, the sentence completion test, the pregnancy symptom checklist, and story writing in response to four TATs. At 12 weeks postpartum, a qualitative interview was conducted, and the maternal-infant sensitivity scale was completed during a feeding session at a scheduled home visit. The results of the study suggest a correlation between self-esteem and the physiological and psychological symptoms reported during pregnancy, and between pregnancy symptoms and postpartum maternal-infant sensitivity. Significant correlations were obtained between maternal and paternal age and the subjects' ego level, and length of marriage and TAT scores. Qualitative interview revealed positive themes of love, compassion, fulfillment in the maternal role, an unexpected 'falling in love' with their infants, and negative themes of sleep deprivation, lack of ability to prioritize activities of daily living, and concern about the marital relationship. Recommendations include replication of the study in a sample of younger primiparas, multiparous women, and a more heterogeneous group of pregnant women. Further research is indicated to investigate the significance of the Roy model on adaptation to pregnancy and motherhood. The results have nursing implications for assessment and intervention in the care of women who begin childbearing in their decade and beyond.","1990-01","2019-02-14 12:24:50","2019-02-14 12:24:50","","","200 p","","","","","","","","","","BOSTON UNIVERSITY","","","","","c8h","UMI Order PUZ9024466","EBSCOhost","","D.N.SC.","","","","Female; Interviews; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Correlational Studies; Postnatal Period; Research Instruments; Maternal Attitudes; Adaptation, Psychological -- In Pregnancy; Attitude to Pregnancy; Ego -- In Pregnancy; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Maternal Age; Maternal Role; Mother-Infant Relations; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Personality; Pregnancy -- Psychosocial Factors; Primiparas -- Psychosocial Factors; Roy Adaptation Model; Self Concept -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the ""de novo mutation"" hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP.Methods: Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population birth cohort.Results: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 0.99-1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a father with schizophrenia and APA.Discussion: In both a general population cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the ""de novo mutation"" hypothesis.","2011-12","2019-02-14 12:24:51","2019-02-14 12:24:51","","125-132","","1-3","133","","Schizophrenia Research","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Prospective Studies; Logistic Regression; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Young Adult; Male; Middle Age; Risk Factors; Retrospective Design; Aged; Finland; Maternal Age; Family Health; Paternal Age; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenia -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to investigate the relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and low birth weight (LBW).Methods: A total of 10,111 women aged 15-50 years were recruited from the ongoing Healthy Baby Cohort study in China, in 2012-2014. Information on sleep habits during pregnancy was obtained by questionnaires at the time of institutional delivery. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Compared with women who reported no napping, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for LBW were 0.83 (95% CI 0.58-1.18) and 0.61 (0.44-0.83) for those who reported ≤1 h and >1 h of napping, respectively (P for trend <0.001). LBW risk reached a threshold at approximately 1.5 h of afternoon napping. The inverse relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW was stronger among women with lower educational level (P for interaction = 0.011). For frequency of afternoon napping, the multivariate analysis suggested a significant inverse association between LBW and napping 5-7 days/week (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92).Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the association between afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW risk. Our findings suggest that appropriate afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping for pregnant women might reduce the risk of LBW.","2018-08","2019-02-14 12:24:51","2019-02-14 12:24:51","","35-41","","","48","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: 344 institutions participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2006. Each subject was requested to fill out a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy were examined using the chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The number of effective responses was 18,965. The prevalence of alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy and during pregnancy was 44.6% and 4.6% respectively. The following items were recognized as being associated with promoting alcohol consumption during pregnancy: greater number of weeks of pregnancy, more pregnancies, fewer years of schooling, being employed, an alcohol consumption before the confirmation of pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, ignorance about the effects of alcohol consumption on fetuses, receiving advice regarding alcohol abstention, difficulty maintaining sleep, and daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSION: It is important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with the alcohol consumption behavior of pregnant women, as revealed in the present study, in order to develop future policies for preventing alcohol consumption among pregnant women.

A novel scoring system has previously been developed for AL in early pregnancy that is associated with pre-eclampsia. It was hypothesized that AL, as identified by the present model, is associated with psychosocial stressors and, specifically, poor sleep quality.Methods: Women were selected from a low-risk, community-dwelling study population who enrolled at <15 weeks gestation. Nine physiologic components were divided among the domains of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory function. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the association of AL with age, income, the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare AL by race and educational attainment.Results: A total of 103 women were identified, with: a mean age of 29.8 ± 5.0 years, 17.5% black, and mean gestational age 12.2 ± 1.1 weeks. Allostatic load was positively correlated with the PSQI (ρ = 0.23, p = 0.018). There were no associations with age, income, prenatal distress, race, or depression scores. College-educated women had lower AL compared with those with less education (0.57 ± 0.43 vs 0.81 ± 0.55, p = 0.045).Conclusion: Higher AL, measured by the pregnancy-specific model, was associated with poorer sleep quality and lower educational attainment, both of which were considered to be chronic stressors. These relationships were consistent with previous findings in non-pregnant populations, and suggest that AL may be useful for capturing the physiologic impact of chronic stress in early pregnancy.","2017-05","2019-02-14 12:24:52","2019-02-14 12:24:52","","85-90","","","33","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Insomnia -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Insomnia -- Psychosocial Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Gestational Age; Adaptation, Physiological -- Physiology; Blacks; Checklists; Income; Insomnia -- Complications; Stress, Psychological -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most studies have focused on preterm birth, and few have assessed BP variability, an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. We studied the association of preterm birth with 24-hour ambulatory BP, measured by an oscillometric device, in 42 young adults born early preterm (<34 weeks), 72 born late preterm (34-36 weeks), and 103 controls (≥37 weeks). Sleep was confirmed with accelerometry in 72.4% of subjects. The 24-hour systolic BP of adults born early preterm was 5.5 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.3), awake systolic BP was 6.4 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 2.8-10.1), and sleeping systolic BP was 2.9 mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval 0.3-7.5) when adjusted for age, sex, and use of accelerometry. The differences remained similar when adjusted for height, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, parental education, maternal body mass index, smoking during pregnancy, and gestational diabetes mellitus and attenuated slightly when adjusted for maternal hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Adults born early preterm also had higher BP variability as indicated by higher individual standard deviations of systolic BP and diastolic BP. Although our results were consistent with a dose-response relationship between shorter gestation and higher BP, the difference between the late preterm and term groups was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that the higher BP in adults born early preterm is present during both waking and sleeping hours, may be more pronounced during waking hours, and is accompanied by higher individual BP variability.","2015-03","2019-02-14 12:24:53","2019-02-14 12:24:53","","615-621","","3","65","","Hypertension (0194911X)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Adult; Human; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Gestational Age; Adult Children; Blood Pressure -- Physiology; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Cardiovascular Diseases -- Epidemiology; Childbirth, Premature -- Physiopathology; Circadian Rhythm -- Physiology; Hypertension -- Epidemiology; Hypertension -- Physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Literature on the effectiveness of music therapy with populations displaying similar symptoms (Amir, 2004; Bensimon, Amir, & Wolf, 2012) suggests that treatment involving music would potentially benefit survivors of sex trafficking. Related Literature: As victims of trafficking, the women are psychologically and physically enslaved. Once rescued, they are in desperate need of trauma-informed aftercare based on neurobiological research that appropriately treats each survivor’s complex needs (Clawson, Salomon, & Grace, 2013). In particular, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, depression, and anxiety are core problems. Objective: The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the status of music therapy with women who have been trafficked, focused in the following ways: (a) Are music therapists working with this population? (b) What are the complex needs identified in the literature? (c) How are music therapists addressing the needs identified in the literature? (d) Does treatment support a neurobiological approach? and (e) What support do music therapists need to work with this population? Methods: Based on a review of the literature, a list of 18 observed needs for the women was compiled and a 20-item questionnaire was designed and distributed via SurveyMonkey. The questions primarily involved rating scales that requested music therapists working with the population to identify information about observed needs, employed music experiences, treatment focuses, and materials they consulted or needed. Participants were sent an e-mail asking them to verify whether they were board-certified music therapists and had worked with clients who had survived trafficking. Twelve participants met the inclusion criteria, and eleven participants completed the questionnaire (91.6% return rate). Responses were analyzed using one-way within-subject ANOVAs, follow-up dependent t-tests using the modified Bonferroni correction, and Pearson r; all were evaluated at α = .05. Two questions also required coding procedures. Results: Results indicated that only a few music therapists are working with the population (n = 12); the age range is 6 to 59, with most survivors between the ages of 12 and 23. Music therapists rated 90% of the listed needs as moderately important or higher, indicating their awareness of the women’s needs. Some observed needs also were considered significantly more important within each domain, except for the cognitive domain: (a) emotion—experiencing anger and depression were significantly more important than guilt; (b) social —difficulty with attachment relationships and mistrust of others were significantly more important than identification with the trafficker; and (c) medical—disruption of sleep/eating cycles was significantly more important than pregnancy complications and physical injuries. All Cohen’s ds supported these results. No significant differences, however, existed among music therapists’ ratings of how often they use seven music experiences, F(6,54) = 1.68, p = .143, Eta2 = .16. The strong effect size suggests that differences may exist if a larger n was available. Post hoc correlations between observed needs and parallel music therapy focuses revealed eight moderately high, significant relationships at p ≤ .048: difficulty learning (r = .67), delayed development (r = .82), anger (r = .89), guilt (r = .78), depression (r = .74), identification with trafficker (r = .85), addictions (r = .87), and sleep/eating cycles (r = .69). Information most often requested by music therapists working with this population (63.5 to 72.7%) was types of trauma, counseling skills, needs of the women, and facts about sex trafficking. Conclusions: The results suggest that women survivors of sex trafficking are a population that is drastically under-represented in music therapy practice. Although music therapists appear to be aware of the needs of the population, they tend to focus their treatment on just a few of the 18 needs, especially those within the emotional and cognitive domains. Data and anecdotal comments from the respondents further suggest a desire (a) for more research (e.g., trauma-informed treatment protocol linking treatment focuses with music experiences) and training; and (b) to form a support group among the music therapists working with these women.","2015-07","2019-02-14 12:24:53","2019-02-14 12:24:53","","182-182","","2","33","","Music Therapy Perspectives","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Human Trafficking; Literature; Music; Music Therapy; Research; Students, Undergraduate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Ireland 49% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases occur when the infant is bed-sharing with an adult. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of bed-sharing during the last sleep period on risk factors for SIDS in Irish infants. DESIGN: An 8 year (1994-2001) population based case control study of 287 SIDS cases and 831 controls matched for date, place of birth, and sleep period. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The risk associated with bed-sharing was three times greater for infants with low birth weight for gestation (UOR 16.28 v 4.90) and increased fourfold if the combined tog value of clothing and bedding was > or =10 (UOR 9.68 v 2.34). The unadjusted odds ratio for bed-sharing was 13.87 (95% CI 9.58 to 20.09) for infants whose mothers smoked and 2.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 4.39) for non-smokers. Age of death for bed-sharing and sofa-sharing infants (12.8 and 8.3 weeks, respectively) was less than for infants not sharing a sleep surface (21.0 weeks, p<0.001) and fewer bed-sharing cases were found prone (5% v 32%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Risk factors for SIDS vary according to the infant's sleeping environment. The increased risk associated with maternal smoking, high tog value of clothing and bedding, and low z scores of weight for gestation at birth is augmented further by bed-sharing. These factors should be taken into account when considering sleeping arrangements for young infants.","2006-04","2019-02-14 12:24:53","2019-02-14 12:24:53","","318-323","","4","91","","Archives of Disease in Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Interviews; Odds Ratio; Sleep; Logistic Regression; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Clothing; Infant; Adult; Human; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; T-Tests; Confidence Intervals; Ireland; Bedding and Linens; Bed Sharing; Birth Weight; Infant Care -- Methods; One-Way Analysis of Variance; Passive Smoking -- Adverse Effects; Prone Position; Sudden Infant Death -- Epidemiology; Univariate Statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: An investigative survey design. SETTING: Primary health care maternal child health centres in one large city in Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 200 mothers selected from a culturally diverse population. All were aged 20 to 35 years, had experienced normal pregnancies, labours, deliveries and delivered a healthy baby between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation. MEASURES AND FINDINGS: The Inventory of Functional Status After Childbirth (IFSAC) (Fawcett Tulman & Myers 1988) was used as the main outcome measure. Three variables predictive of functional status after childbirth were identified, namely, satisfaction with level of stamina and well-being, sleep pattern at night and perceived lack of support following childbirth. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Return to full functional status as measured by IFSAC takes longer than physiological recovery after childbirth. Women who experience diminished well-being, interrupted sleep patterns and lacked support, appeared to be at greater risk of role congestion, overload and dysfunction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: To help women avoid the additive nature of assuming the motherhood role while also resuming past role responsibilities, practitioners could encourage pregnant women to develop a postnatal support plan. Women need to be proactive in negotiating specific and ongoing support from others with household responsibilities and some aspects of baby care.","1997-12","2019-02-14 12:24:54","2019-02-14 12:24:54","","172-178","","4","13","","Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Infant, Newborn; Australia; Chi Square Test; T-Tests; Postnatal Period; Regression; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Functional Status; Internal Consistency; Physical Endurance; Support, Psychosocial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The majority of stillbirths in this setting occur in women without risk factors. In addition, many established risk factors such as nulliparity and maternal age are not amenable to modification during pregnancy. Identification of other risk factors which could be amenable to change in pregnancy should be a priority in stillbirth prevention research. Therefore, this study aimed to utilise an online survey asking women who had a stillbirth about their pregnancy in order to identify any common symptoms and experiences.Methods: A web-based survey.Results: A total of 1,714 women who had experienced a stillbirth >3 weeks prior to enrolment completed the survey. Common experiences identified were: perception of changes in fetal movement (63% of respondents), reports of a ""gut instinct"" that something was wrong (68%), and perceived time of death occurring overnight (56%). A quarter of participants believed that their baby's death was due to a cord issue and another 18% indicated that they did not know the reason why their baby died. In many cases (55%) the mother believed the cause of death was different to that told by clinicians.Conclusions: This study confirms the association between altered fetal movements and stillbirth and highlights novel associations that merit closer scrutiny including a maternal gut instinct that something was wrong. The potential importance of maternal sleep is highlighted by the finding of more than half the mothers believing their baby died during the night. This study supports the importance of listening to mothers' concerns and symptoms during pregnancy and highlights the need for thorough investigation of stillbirth and appropriate explanation being given to parents.","2015-01","2019-02-14 12:24:54","2019-02-14 12:24:54","","172-172","","1","15","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The World Health Organisation reports that 15 to 57% of women in developing countries experience symptoms of depression. Maternal mental illness has a negative impact on infant and young child (IYC) growth, development and care, having serious health implications in terms of physical, cognitive and emotional well-being during crucial stages of the life span, such as the first 1000 days and early childhood. Various studies conducted in both developed and developing countries, have shown that maternal depression is associated with negative health outcomes such as: low birth weight, developmental delay, incomplete immunisation schedules, acute or chronic diarrhoea, somatic symptoms, disrupted sleep patterns and child abuse, as well as psychiatric and neuro-behavioural disorders. In addition, maternal depression impairs IYC care practices related to breastfeeding, health care, safety and development. It also contributes to inadequate nutrition during pregnancy as well as that of offspring during infancy and childhood, resulting in suboptimal brain development and inadequate growth. Infants with depressed mothers are not only vulnerable to becoming underweight, but also being stunted.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:24:55","2019-02-14 12:24:55","","1-7","","1","31","","South African Journal of Clinical Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Child; Infant; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Anxiety; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Breast Feeding; Acute Disease -- Etiology; Child Abuse -- Etiology; Child Development; Child Development Disorders -- Etiology; Child Health; Chronic Disease -- Etiology; Cognition Disorders -- Etiology; Depression -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Depression, Postpartum -- Complications; Diarrhea -- Etiology; Growth Disorders; Health Care Delivery; Immunization Schedule; Life Cycle; Malnutrition -- In Pregnancy; Medically Unexplained Symptoms -- Etiology; Mental Disorders -- Etiology; Mental Disorders -- In Pregnancy; Psychological Well-Being; Somatoform Disorders -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores of probable depression ( X 13.39; p < 0.001). Berlin-assessed risk of SDB was also associated with probable depression ( X 9.20 p < 0.01), though this was attenuated following multivariate analysis. There was a significant relationship between total PSQI score and the tendency for participants to attribute 'sleep-related causes' to their low mood ( X 20.78; p < 0.001). This study confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI).","2014-08","2019-02-14 12:24:55","2019-02-14 12:24:55","","291-302","","4","17","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Body Mass Index; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Fisher's Exact Test; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Scales; T-Tests; Confidence Intervals; Sleep Disorders; Clinical Assessment Tools; Depression, Postpartum -- Complications; Linear Regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nurses who understand the prevalence, signs and symptoms, and risk factors associated with AD can help to identify it and prevent the sequelae. The signs and symptoms of depression in pregnancy do not differ from depression at any other time. However, AD may go undiagnosed because of a focus on maternal and fetal well-being and the attribution of complaints to the physical and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. Risk factors include history of depression, lack of partner, marital difficulties, lack of social support, poverty, family violence, increased life stress, substance abuse, history of previous abortions, unplanned pregnancy, ambivalence toward the pregnancy and anxiety about the fetus. Most of the standard treatments for depression can be used in pregnant women, with the exception of some antidepressant medications. Supportive therapies -- exercise, adequate nutrition, adequate sleep, and support from family and friends -- are also indicated. Screening of women with known risk factors is crucial, but the authors suggest that the high overall prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy indicates a need for universal screening.","2006-11","2019-02-14 12:24:56","2019-02-14 12:24:56","","27-30","","9","102","","Canadian Nurse","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Psychological Tests; Depression -- Diagnosis; Prenatal Care; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Depression -- Drug Therapy; Depression -- Risk Factors; Depression -- Symptoms; Depression -- Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Antidepressants are commonly used during pregnancy, yet their impact on offspring attention and their interaction with maternal anxiety has not been assessed. The authors used P50 auditory sensory gating, a putative marker of early attentional processes measurable in young infants, to assess the impact of maternal anxiety and antidepressant use.Method: A total of 242 mother-infant dyads were classified relative to maternal history of anxiety and maternal prenatal antidepressant use. Infant P50 auditory sensory gating was recorded during active sleep at a mean age of 76 days (SD=38).Results: In the absence of prenatal antidepressant exposure, infants whose mothers had a history of anxiety diagnoses had diminished P50 sensory gating. Prenatal antidepressant exposure mitigated the effect of anxiety. The effect of maternal anxiety was limited to amplitude of response to the second stimulus, while antidepressant exposure had an impact on the amplitude of response to both the first and second stimulus.Conclusions: Maternal anxiety disorders are associated with less inhibition during infant sensory gating, a performance deficit mitigated by prenatal antidepressant exposure. This effect may be important in considering the risks and benefits of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Cholinergic mechanisms are hypothesized for both anxiety and antidepressant effects, although the cholinergic receptors involved are likely different for anxiety and antidepressant effects.","2012-06","2019-02-14 12:24:57","2019-02-14 12:24:57","","616-624","","6","169","","American Journal of Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Infant; Adult; Human; Male; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Drug Therapy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Acoustic Stimulation -- Psychosocial Factors; Antidepressive Agents -- Therapeutic Use; Anxiety Disorders -- Complications; Anxiety Disorders -- Drug Therapy; Evoked Potentials, Auditory -- Physiology; Nervous System Physiology -- Drug Effects; Nervous System Physiology -- Physiology; Prenatal Care -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study design: Thirty-nine women who had experienced two or more RMs were measured before and after their evaluation and investigation in the RM clinic. A battery of questionnaires including the STAI scale and various instruments were administered to record anxiety, mental, and physical components of quality of life and sleep quality. Several statistical tests including canonical correlation were performed. Results: All the patients revealed a mild to moderate level of anxiety, low numbers of physical and mental health but reasonably normal values of the global quality of sleep. The evaluation in the RM clinic and investigation for possible causes accounting for RM did not significantly change anxiety levels. The children-to-pregnancies ratio introduced into the analysis proved to correlate significantly with the sleep quality and mental health. Summarized anxiety in a given RM woman could be predicted based on the set of the variables, characterizing the woman's reproductive status and her psychological health. Conclusions: This study establishes anxiety as a common response in RM patients, and suggests factors that predict it. Knowing these factors may help clinicians to identify more accurately those RM patients who would be prone to a high level of anxiety and therefore need more attention and reassurance.","2012-09","2019-02-14 12:24:57","2019-02-14 12:24:57","","495-501","","5","40","","Journal of Perinatal Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Fisher's Exact Test; T-Tests; Anxiety; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Repeated Measures; Kruskal-Wallis Test; One-Way Analysis of Variance; Abortion, Spontaneous -- Complications; Academic Medical Centers; Israel; Mann-Whitney U Test; Multiple Regression; Quality of Life; Recurrence -- Psychosocial Factors; Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36); Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated to determine the usefulness of this measure in early pregnancy. The psychometric properties of the PSQI were evaluated in women at 14 weeks of pregnancy and revealed the instrument to have good internal consistency and convergent and divergent reliability properties. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the removal of the PSQI sleeping medications sub-scale from the global sleep quality total score calculation would improve the utility of this measure in early pregnancy. Women classified as depressed on the basis of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were found to have significantly poorer sleep quality scores on the majority of PSQI sub-scales. The relationship between sleep quality and depression was found to be statistically significant and clinically relevant during early pregnancy and the PSQI would appear to be an appropriate measure to assess sleep quality in this group.","2007-02","2019-02-14 12:24:59","2019-02-14 12:24:59","","87-99","","1","25","","Journal of Reproductive & Infant Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Coefficient Alpha; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; T-Tests; Psychometrics; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Internal Consistency; P-Value; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Factor Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Data from the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used. All women (n = 2951) of childbearing age (18-44 years) who were pregnant and responded to all fruit and vegetable consumption and sleep duration questions were included. Covariates included age, race, education level, exercise, and marital status. Data were analyzed using linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results Total daily fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with sleep duration among pregnant women, controlling for confounders [β = −0.03, (−0.07, 0.00)]. Orange and green vegetable consumption were both inversely associated with sleep duration [β = −0.19, (−0.38, −0.01) and β = −0.20, (−0.33, −0.08) respectively]. Ordinal logistic regression found that the odds of meeting or exceeding sleep time recommendations increased slightly with each unit increase in total fruit and vegetable consumption [OR = 1.05 (1.003, 1.092)] and for every unit increase in fruit consumption [OR = 1.12 (1.038, 1.208)]. Women who exercised within the past 30 days reported approximately 20 min of additional sleep compared to those who did not [β = 0.32 (0.16, 0.49)]. Age, employment status, and marital status were also independently associated with sleep duration. Discussion Sleep duration in pregnant women was associated with exercise and other demographic factors, but only mildly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Future research should investigate the effects of additional factors including sleep quality, gestational age, family status and other medications as potential confounders.","2017-05","2019-02-14 12:24:59","2019-02-14 12:24:59","","966-973","","5","21","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Marital Status; Age Factors; United States; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Confidence Intervals; Analysis of Variance; Linear Regression; P-Value; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Eating Behavior -- In Pregnancy; Employment Status; Exercise; Fruit; Vegetables","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, women who had a stillbirth were more likely to report sleep duration less than 5.5 hours on the night before stillbirth (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.68), getting up to the toilet once or less (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.85-4.26), and a daytime nap every day (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.94). No interaction was detected between supine going-to-sleep position and a small-for-gestational-age infant, maternal body mass index, or gestational age. The population-attributable risk for supine going-to-sleep position was 3.7% (95% CI 0.5-9.2).Conclusions: This study confirms that supine going-to-sleep position is associated with late stillbirth. Further work is required to determine whether intervention(s) can decrease the frequency of supine going-to-sleep position and the incidence of late stillbirth.Tweetable Abstract: Supine going-to-sleep position is associated with 2.3× increased risk of stillbirth after 28 weeks' gestation.Plain Language Summary: Stillbirth, the death of a baby before birth, is a tragedy for mothers and families. One approach to reduce stillbirths is to identify factors that are associated with stillbirth. There are few risk factors for stillbirth that can be easily changed, but this study is looking at identifying how mothers may be able to reduce their risk. In this study, we interviewed 291 women who had a stillbirth and 733 women who had a live-born baby from 41 maternity units throughout the UK. The mothers who had a stillbirth were interviewed as soon as practical after their baby died. Mothers who had a live birth were interviewed during their pregnancies at the same times in pregnancy as when the stillbirths occurred. We did not interview mothers who had twins or who had a baby with a major abnormality. Mothers who went to sleep on their back had at least twice the risk of stillbirth compared with mothers who went to sleep on their left-hand side. This study suggests that 3.7% of stillbirths after 28 weeks of pregnancy were linked with going to sleep lying on the back. This study also shows that the link between going-to-sleep position and late stillbirth was not affected by the duration of pregnancy after 28 weeks, the size of the baby, or the mother's weight. Women who got up to the toilet once or more at night had a reduced risk of stillbirth. This is the largest of four similar studies that have all shown the same link between the position in which a mother goes to sleep and stillbirth after 28 weeks of pregnancy. Further studies are needed to see whether women can easily change their sleep position in late pregnancy and whether changing the position a mother goes to sleep in reduces stillbirth.","2018-01-15","2019-02-14 12:25:00","2019-02-14 12:25:00","","254-262","","2","125","","BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were classified as ""High Risk"" or ""Low Risk"" for sleep apnea based on responses to the Berlin, while ""Normal"" or ""Abnormal"" daytime sleepiness was determined based on responses to the Epworth.Design: Neonatal umbilical cord blood samples (N = 67) were collected and genomic DNA was isolated from cord blood leukocytes using Quantitative PCR. A ratio of relative telomere length was derived by telomere repeat copy number and single copy gene copy number (T/S ratio) and used to compare telomere lengths. Bootstrap and ANOVA statistical procedures were employed.Measurements and Results: On the Berlin, 68.7% of participants were classified as Low Risk while 31.3% were classified as High Risk for sleep apnea. According to the Epworth scale, 80.6% were determined to have Normal daytime sleepiness, and 19.4% were found to have Abnormal daytime sleepiness. The T/S ratio among pregnant women at High Risk for sleep apnea was significantly shorter than for those at Low Risk (P value < 0.05), and the T/S ratio among habitual snorers was significantly shorter than among non-habitual snorers (P value < 0.05). Although those with Normal Sleepiness had a longer T/S ratio than those with Abnormal Sleepiness, the difference was not statistically significant.Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating shortened telomere length among fetuses exposed to maternal symptoms of sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy, and suggest sleep disordered breathing as a possible mechanism of accelerated chromosomal aging.","2015-04","2019-02-14 12:25:00","2019-02-14 12:25:00","","559-566","","4","38","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modeled separately, moderate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.96-per hour/week) and vigorous (OR = 0.67; 95 % CI = 0.46-0.98 for yes vs. no) exercise during the second trimester were associated with a reduced odds of PTD, and sleep duration was not (OR = 1.09, 95 % CI = 0.80-1.48 for <7 h; OR = 0.88, 95 % CI = 0.57-1.48 for >8 h vs. 7-8 h). When sleep and exercise variables were modeled together along with pre-pregnancy BMI, only moderate exercise (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.85-0.98) continued to be associated with reduced odds of PTD. The benefits of moderate exercise appeared strongest for women with BMI greater than 24 kg/m (OR = 0.85; 95 % CI = 0.79-0.93) and weakened with decreasing BMI. No other interactions were found. Moderate exercise is associated with reduced PTD, particularly for women with BMI above the normal range. The results are of public health relevance given that these risk factors are potentially modifiable both pre-conceptionally and during pregnancy and rates of PTD are still high in the United States.","2013-05","2019-02-14 12:25:00","2019-02-14 12:25:00","","723-731","","4","17","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","California; Female; Interviews; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Scales; Confidence Intervals; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Body Weight -- In Pregnancy; Childbirth, Premature; Exercise -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Few studies reporting such associations have focused on women of childbearing age. This paper investigates this association among Canadian women of childbearing age.Methods: Data were from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2011-2014. The sample consisted of women aged 18-44 years. All variables were self-reported. Sleep duration was dichotomized as insufficient (< 7 h/night) or adequate (≥ 7 h/night). A composite score of sleep quality was used and dichotomized as poor none/little of the time or some/most/all of the time. Height and weight were used to calculate body mass index. Associations between sleep and OW/OB were assessed using logistic regression analyses with survey weights. Three models were computed for sleep duration/quality: model without covariates, model adjusted for demographics (age, ethnicity, level of education, household income, marital status, employment, parity, region, and season), and model adjusted for demographics and variables associated with OW/OB (mood disorder, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol).Results: Total sample consisted of 9749 women of childbearing age. Thirty-eight percent had insufficient sleep duration. Sleep duration was significantly associated with OW/OB in the model with no covariates and discriminated 52.8% of women of childbearing age, but this association was no longer significant in the models adjusted for covariates. Sleep quality was not significantly linked to OW/OB in any of the models.Conclusion: Targeting sleep alone would likely not contribute to lower risk of OW/OB among Canadian women of childbearing age. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones, are needed to confirm these findings.","2018-08","2019-02-14 12:25:00","2019-02-14 12:25:00","","516-526","","4","109","","Canadian Journal of Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short sleep duration in childhood appears to have a greater impact on the risk for adult obesity than adult sleep duration. The long-term effects of childhood sleep on glucose metabolism have not been investigated. The authors assessed the associations between childhood and adult sleep duration and adult glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Methods An unselected cohort of 1037 individuals, born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between 1972 and 1973. Parent reports of times in bed at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 were used to estimate childhood sleep duration. Adult sleep duration was estimated from self-reported times in bed at age 32. HbA1c levels were measured at age 32. Pregnant women and participants with diabetes were excluded from the analyses. Results Childhood sleep duration did not predict adult HbA1c. However, less time spent in bed at age 32 was associated with higher levels of HbA1c (p=0.002) and an increased risk of prediabetes (p=0.015). The inverse association between adult sleep times and HbA1c was independent of body mass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, shift work and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea. Conclusions Short sleep duration is associated with higher levels of HbA1c and an increased risk of prediabetes in young adults. The findings suggest that inadequate sleep impairs glucose control in the short term and may increase the risk for long-term health problems.","2012-10","2019-02-14 12:25:10","2019-02-14 12:25:10","","957-961","","10","66","","Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Prospective Studies; Child; Questionnaires; Human; Young Adult; Male; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Confidence Intervals; New Zealand; Socioeconomic Factors; Obesity; Child Development; Body Weights and Measures; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Risk Assessment; Sleep Deprivation -- Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnant women often have sleep disturbances and extreme sleep duration. Investigations of the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have reported inconsistent results. The present study aimed to meta-analyze the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk.Methods: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for studies that were published up to October 2017, that reported associations between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes for all studies. Heterogeneity and potential publication biases were assessed.Results: A total of 4366 papers were retrieved, among which seven studies assessed the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM development. The seven articles included 18,203 subjects at baseline and 1294 GDM cases during follow-up. Compared to normal sleep duration, extreme sleep duration during early and middle pregnant stages had a close relationship with GDM based upon pooled data from prospective and cross-sectional studies. Prospective results showed that long sleep duration during pregnancy was a risk factor for GDM, but not short sleep duration. Publication biases were found when analyzing the relationship between extreme sleep duration and GDM.Conclusions: Extreme sleep duration during pregnancy is closely associated with GDM. Moreover, long but not short sleep duration can predict the risk of developing GDM. These findings remind us of the importance of sleep duration control during pregnancy and help optimize early strategies for the prevention of GDM.","2018-12","2019-02-14 12:25:10","2019-02-14 12:25:10","","67-74","","","52","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants and health care providers were blinded to the sleep test results. An apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or greater was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Exposure-response relationships were examined, grouping participants into four apnea-hypopnea index groups: 0, greater than 0 to less than 5, 5 to less than 15, and 15 or greater. The study was powered to test the primary hypothesis that sleep-disordered breathing occurring in pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, defined as preeclampsia and antepartum gestational hypertension, and GDM. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.Results: Three thousand seven hundred five women were enrolled. Apnea-hypopnea index data were available for 3,132 (84.5%) and 2,474 (66.8%) women in early and midpregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%. The prevalence of preeclampsia was 6.0%, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 13.1%, and GDM 4.1%. In early and midpregnancy the adjusted odds ratios for preeclampsia when sleep-disordered breathing was present were 1.94 (95% CI 1.07-3.51) and 1.95 (95% CI 1.18-3.23), respectively; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 1.46 (95% CI 0.91-2.32) and 1.73 (95% CI 1.19-2.52); and GDM 3.47 (95% CI 1.95-6.19) and 2.79 (95% CI 1.63-4.77).

Hierarchical linear regression models with 11 variables explained 36% of the variance in fatigue while 14 variables explained 30% of the variance in energy. Independent variables making unique contributions to fatigue severity perception were sleep disturbance, negative life events and role demands.

We also prospectively examined whether women with MS had an increased risk of developing RLS during 4 years of follow-up.Methods: The main analysis was based on a cross-sectional study of 65,544 women (aged 41-58 years) free of diabetes, arthritis, and pregnancy, who were participating in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Participants were considered to have RLS if they met 4 RLS diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group and had restless legs ≥ 5 times/month. MS was self-reported and confirmed by medical record review.Results: Among women with MS, the prevalence of RLS and severe RLS (15+ times/month) were 15.5% and 9.9% in 2005, respectively, relative to 6.4% and 2.6% among women without MS. After adjustment for potential confounders and the presence of other sleep disorders, women with MS had a higher likelihood of having RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-3.93), severe RLS (OR = 4.12, 95% CI 2.65-6.42), and daily daytime sleepiness (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.31-3.42) compared with women without MS.

The adjusted relative risk of severe RLS was 3.58 (95% CI 1.53-8.35), comparing women with MS at baseline with those without MS.Conclusion: Women with MS had a significantly higher prevalence of RLS and daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of developing RLS in the future.","2012-05-08","2019-02-14 12:25:13","2019-02-14 12:25:13","","1500-1506","","19","78","","Neurology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Middle Age; Multiple Sclerosis -- Complications; Restless Legs -- Complications; Sleep Disorders -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders. Results Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P < .001). After adjustment for confounders including maternal depression, poor subjective sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of > 5 vs. ≤ 5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=1.67; 95% CI 1.02–2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR=1.18; 95% CI 1.08–1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a 3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=3.48; 95% CI 1.96–6.18) as compared with those who had neither risk factor. Conclusion Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation. Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.","2015-10-09","2019-02-14 12:25:14","2019-02-14 12:25:14","","441-447","","5","37","","General Hospital Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Sleep; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Expectant Mothers; Scales; Confidence Intervals; Sleep Disorders; Prenatal Care; Peru; Study Design; Suicidal Ideation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Key Points: Question: Are prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms associated with individual variations of offspring white matter microstructure? Findings: In this cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads, prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with infants' white matter microstructure at 1 month of age. Moreover, analyses suggest that prenatal maternal depression and anxiety may be differentially associated with infant male and female microstructure. Meaning: The prenatal environment is important to early brain development, and underlying white matter microstructure may be susceptible to the continuum of maternal depression and anxiety symptom exposure during the prenatal period. Importance: Maternal depression and anxiety can have deleterious and lifelong consequences on child development. However, many aspects of the association of early brain development with maternal symptoms remain unclear. Understanding the timing of potential neurobiological alterations holds inherent value for the development and evaluation of future therapies and interventions. Objective: To examine the association between exposure to prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms and offspring white matter microstructure at 1 month of age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads used a composite of depression and anxiety symptoms measured in mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy and measures of white matter microstructure characterized in the mothers' 1-month offspring using diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging performed from October 1, 2014, to November 30, 2016. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research facility during natural, nonsedated sleep. Main Outcomes and Measures: Brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the association between maternal depression and anxiety and 1-month infant white matter microstructure as measured by diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging findings. Results: In the 101 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] age of mothers, 33.22 [3.99] years; mean age of infants at magnetic resonance imaging, 33.07 days [range, 18-50 days]; 92 white mothers [91.1%]; 53 male infants [52.5%]), lower 1-month white matter microstructure (decreased neurite density and increased mean, radial, and axial diffusivity) was associated in right frontal white matter microstructure with higher prenatal maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. Significant sex × symptom interactions with measures of white matter microstructure were also observed, suggesting that white matter development may be differentially sensitive to maternal depression and anxiety symptoms in males and females during the prenatal period. Conclusions and Relevance: These data highlight the importance of the prenatal period to early brain development and suggest that the underlying white matter microstructure is associated with the continuum of prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.","2018-10","2019-02-14 12:25:15","2019-02-14 12:25:15","","973-981","","10","172","","JAMA Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Infant; Adult; Human; Male; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Anxiety; Prenatal Care; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Mother-Infant Relations; Algorithms; Diagnosis, Brain; Infant Development; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Methods; Models, Statistical; White Matter -- Pathology -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Pregnant women (N = 374) were enrolled, and data were collected at a mean gestation of 20 weeks in this cross-sectional study. Plasma was analyzed for TRP, KYN, neopterin, and nitrite levels. Women completed demographic and mood scales. Results: There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between body mass index (BMI) and TRP and positive correlations between BMI and KYN and the kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio. Neopterin was correlated with KYN/TRP, suggesting that the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) enzyme was activated. The correlations of neopterin and nitrite with BMI were too small to be clinically meaningful but may provide mechanistic insight. There was a correlation between depressed mood and nitrite levels. Depressed mood was also associated with lower TRP levels. When the sample was divided into pregnant women with or without obesity, TRP was significantly lower and the KYN/TRP ratio was significantly higher in the women with obesity. Conclusion: The pro-inflammatory state of obesity in pregnancy may drive activation of IDO-1, resulting in diversion of TRP away from serotonin and melatonin production and toward KYN metabolites. This alteration could contribute to depression, impaired sleep, increased production of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, and reinforcement of a pro-inflammatory state in pregnancy.","2018-05","2019-02-14 12:25:15","2019-02-14 12:25:15","","284-291","","3","20","","Biological Research for Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Cross Sectional Studies; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Depression; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Psychological Tests; Summated Rating Scaling; T-Tests; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; P-Value; Amino Acids -- Blood; Catabolism; Florida; Inflammation; Obesity -- Immunology -- In Pregnancy; Tryptophan -- Blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No study has investigated the associations among sleep, overweight/obesity, and risk of type 2 diabetes among childbearing-age women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods: Data were from NHANES, 2005–2008. The study population consisted of 18–44 year old women. Pregnant women and those diagnosed with sleep disorders were excluded. Sleep duration and quality were self-reported. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) measurements, and a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed by trained NHANES staff. An unadjusted linear regression analysis; a second adjusted for demographics only (partially adjusted model); and a third adjusted for demographics and variables associated with overweight/obesity and diabetes (fully adjusted model) were computed to assess associations among sleep duration/quality and BMI, WC, and 2-hour OGTT. Results: Total sample consisted of 2388 childbearing-age women. Only sleep duration was significantly associated with BMI and WC in the unadjusted and partially adjusted models, but was no longer significant in the fully adjusted model. Neither sleep duration nor quality was significantly associated with 2-hour OGTT in any of the models. Conclusions: Targeting sleep duration and sleep quality alone would not likely contribute to significantly lower BMI, WC, or risk of type 2 diabetes in US childbearing-age women. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones using objective measures of sleep, are needed to confirm these findings.","2018-11","2019-02-14 12:25:15","2019-02-14 12:25:15","","1400-1407","","11","27","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Adolescence; Adult; Human; United States; Young Adult; Self Report; Surveys; Obesity; Women's Health; Maternal Age; Sleep Hygiene; Linear Regression; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 -- Risk Factors -- United States; Glucose Tolerance Test; Health Personnel; Waist Circumference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there is some evidence to suggest that maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, there is a need to systematically review this evidence to guide future research and clinical practice. Methods Five electronic databases were systematically scanned. Key journals and reference lists were hand-searched. Papers were included if: (1) pregnant women were assessed for maternal-foetal attachment; (2) the infants were later assessed, under 2 years old, for any developmental outcome (e.g., social-emotional, cognition, motor, language, adaptive behaviour); and (3) they were published in English. Two independent reviewers used the STROBE checklist to appraise the quality of each paper. Results Of the 968 papers identified, eight were included in the review, and four of these were of low quality (<60 %) based on the STROBE. The developmental domains that were examined included: infant temperament (n = 5), adaptive behaviour (e.g., colic, sleep) (n = 2), and milestone attainment (n = 1). There is some evidence to suggest that lower maternal-foetal attachment is related to suboptimal developmental outcomes. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited and low quality studies available. Conclusions Although maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, future research is required which: (1) considers a range of developmental outcomes, (2) has increased scientific rigour, (3) assesses mother-infant dyads at different prenatal and postnatal time points, and (4) examines different target populations.","2017-03","2019-02-14 12:25:16","2019-02-14 12:25:16","","540-553","","3","21","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Infant; Human; Expectant Mothers; CINAHL Database; PubMed; Systematic Review; Checklists; Embase; Child, Preschool; Infant Development; Adaptation, Psychological; Infant Behavior; Prenatal Bonding; Psycinfo; Research Methodology -- Evaluation; Temperament -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Clinic-based study. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 1,272 healthy, pregnant women. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We abstracted maternal antenatal BP values from medical records and estimated mean BP differences across hours of sleep categories in regression models, using generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia (PE) in relation to long and short sleep duration were estimated. Mean 1st and 2nd trimester systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values were similar among women reporting to be short sleepers (< or = 6 h) vs. women reporting to sleep 9 hours. However, both short and long sleep duration in early pregnancy were associated with increased mean 3rd trimester SBP and DBP. For example, mean 3rd trimester SBP was 3.72, and 2.43 mm Hg higher for women reporting < or = 6 h and 7-8 h sleep, respectively, compared with women reporting 9 h of sleep. Mean 3rd trimester SBP was 4.21 mm Hg higher for women reporting long sleep (> or = 10 h) vs. the reference group. Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased risks of PIH and PE. The ORs for very short (< 5 h) and long (> or = 10 h) sleepers were 9.52 (95% CI 1.83 to 49.40) and 2.45 (95% CI 0.74 to 8.15) for PE.

However, little is known about the association of SDB with timing of delivery. We examined the association of snoring frequency, a key SDB marker, and snoring intensity, a correlate of SDB severity, with time-to-delivery among a cohort of pregnant women.Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 1483 third trimester pregnant women were recruited from the University of Michigan prenatal clinics. Women completed a questionnaire about their sleep, and demographic and pregnancy information was abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of those with hypertension or diabetes, 954 women were classified into two groups by their snoring onset timing, chronic or pregnancy-onset. Within each of these groups, women were divided into four groups based on their snoring frequency and intensity: non-snorers; infrequent-quiet; frequent-quiet; or frequent-loud snorers. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between snoring frequency and intensity and time-to-delivery, adjusting for maternal characteristics.Results: Chronic snoring was reported by half of the pregnant women, and of those, 7% were frequent-loud snorers. Deliveries before 38 weeks' gestation are completed occurred among 25% of women with chronic, frequent-loud snoring. Compared with pre-pregnancy non-snorers, women with chronic frequent-loud snoring had an increased hazard ratio for delivery (adjusted hazard ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.45).Conclusions: Snoring frequency and intensity is associated with time-to-delivery in women absent of hypertension or diabetes. Frequent-loud snoring may have a clinical utility to identify otherwise low-risk women who are likely to deliver earlier.","2018-11","2019-02-14 12:25:17","2019-02-14 12:25:17","","504-511","","6","32","","Paediatric & Perinatal Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Asthma at 14 years predicted snoring at 21 years, while poor sleep quality and snoring in women predicted asthma at 21 years, the latter partially mediated by body mass index.Conclusions: The relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring varied by gender. Sleep quality and snoring should be considered in the assessment and holistic management of asthma. The predictive relationship seen between 14 and 21 years provides an opportunity to address these issues at a younger age.","2016-11","2019-02-14 12:25:17","2019-02-14 12:25:17","","1019-1025","","11","52","","Journal of Paediatrics & Child Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of maternal asthma on preterm delivery and fetal growth. METHODS: Study participants were individuals enrolled in the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists Asthma Medications in Pregnancy Study between February 1, 1998, and December 31, 2003. Pregnant women with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 719) evaluated their asthma control repeatedly during pregnancy based on symptom frequency and interference with daily activities and sleep and reported hospitalizations and unscheduled clinic visits for asthma exacerbations. The incidence of preterm delivery, the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, and mean birth weight were evaluated relative to asthma symptom control and exacerbation measures. RESULTS: The incidence of preterm delivery was significantly higher among patients with inadequate asthma symptom control during the first part of pregnancy (11.4%) compared with patients with adequate asthma control (6.3%; P = .02). Similarly, patients who were hospitalized for asthma during pregnancy had a higher incidence of preterm delivery (16.4%) compared with asthmatic women without a history of hospitalization (7.6%; P = .02). The effect seemed independent from use of systemic corticosteroids and other covariates. Neither the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction nor mean birth weight varied by any measures of asthma symptom control or exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a substantial risk for preterm delivery posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma and provides additional evidence regarding the importance of adequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy to maintain optimal asthma control.","2008-08","2019-02-14 12:25:18","2019-02-14 12:25:18","","137-143","","2","101","","Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Complications -- Therapy; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Middle Age; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Asthma -- Epidemiology; Asthma -- Therapy; Childbirth, Premature -- Epidemiology; Childbirth, Premature -- Etiology; Fetal Growth Retardation -- Epidemiology; Fetal Growth Retardation -- Etiology; Hospitalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The general attitude towards family formation was characterized by a fear of the consequences of choosing motherhood on one hand, and a ‘ticking biological clock’ and a wish to establish a nuclear family on the other. The women idealized the perception of perfect mothering in terms of uncompromising expectations of child rearing and showed an increasing awareness of solo motherhood as a possible solution to advanced age, the wish of a child and single status compared to earlier studies.

The auditory system becomes functional at around 25 weeks' gestation. The cochlea of the middle ear and the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are most important in the development of the auditory system. They are both easily affected by the environment and care practices in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU). The period from 25 weeks' gestation to 5 to 6 months of age is most critical to the development of the neurosensory part of the auditory system. This is the time when the hair cells of the cochlea, the axons of the auditory nerve, and the neurons of the temporal lobe auditory cortex are tuned to receive signals of specific frequencies and intensities. Unlike the visual system, the auditory system requires outside auditory stimulation. This needs to include speech, music, and meaningful sounds from the environment. The preterm as well as the term infant cannot recognize or discriminate meaningful sounds with background noise levels greater than 60 dB. The more intense the background noise, especially low frequency, the fewer specific frequencies (pitch) can be heard and used to tune the hair cells of the cochlea. Continuous exposure to loud background noise in the NICU or home will interfere with auditory development and especially frequency discrimination. The initial stimulation of the auditory system (speech and music) needs to occur in utero or in the NICU to develop tonotopic columns in the auditory cortex and to have the critical tuning of the hair cells of the cochlea occur. The control of outside noise, the exposure to meaningful speech sounds and music, and the protection of sleep and sleep cycles, especially rapid eye movement sleep, are essential for healthy auditory development. The environment and care practices for the fetus in utero or the infant in the NICU are critical factors in the development of the auditory system.

White noise from 50 to 100 decibels (dB) was administered at 10 dB intervals twice within non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states and arousal thresholds measured.Results: Combining groups, 306 tests were completed (128 and 178 within REM and NREM sleep, respectively) and infants were more likely to wake at lower thresholds in REM than NREM sleep (hazard ratio 5.58; 95% CI, 3.78-8.23 p < 0.0001).

Our multicenter neonatal sleep consortium has acquired more than 1,100 multihour EEG-sleep recordings on over 370 neonates, ranging from 24 to 44 weeks gestation. Each recording was visually-scored for state, arousals, movements, and rapid eye movements, which were used as templates when applying spectral analyses. The authors have defined a brain dysmaturity index to represent functional brain reorganization as the prenate matures to a full-term age; delayed or accelerated physiologic behaviors have been described for the preterm cohort when compared to the full-term group at the same postmenstrual age. Seven EEG-sleep measures comprise this index: quiet sleep percentage, sleep cycle length, rapid eye movements, arousals, spectral beta EEG energies, spectral EEG correlations, and a spectral measure of respiratory regularity. Linear and nonlinear computational algorithms are being developed to automate the computation of the dysmaturity index and to identify new feature types that correlate with dysmaturity. Automated neonatal sleep monitoring system can potentially improve neonatal neurointensive care by facilitating analyses of pervasive neonatal brain disorders expressed primarily as altered sleep state organization, and help predict altered developmental trajectories of children at higher risk for neurologic sequelae.","2005-08","2019-02-14 12:25:19","2019-02-14 12:25:19","","256-270","","4","22","","Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Human; Polysomnography; Infant, Newborn; Male; Sleep -- Physiology; Childbirth, Premature -- Physiopathology; Bar Coding -- Methods; Brain -- Pathology; Brain -- Physiopathology; Chaos Theory; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Intensive Care, Neonatal; Monitoring, Physiologic -- Methods; Predictive Value of Tests; Spectrum Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Respiratory vagal activity is expressed by heart rate variability (HRV) at approximately 1 month of age in premature low-birth-weight infants (PLBWI). However, the autonomic inputs into the sinus node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN) in PLBWI are unclear. We evaluated the variability in PP and PR intervals at day zero (day 0) and 1 month (1 month) after birth in 16 PLBWI (gestation 32.3± 1.3 weeks, birth weight 1.578± 257 g). The polygraph was recorded during sleep on day 0 and at 1 month. PP and PR intervals and the number of respiratory cycles were measured, and frequency analysis was performed by auto-correlation fast Fourier transforms. Power spectral density (PSD: ms2) was calculated for the low frequency domain (LF: 0.036~0.146 Hz), high frequency domain (HF: 0.146~0.390 Hz), total frequency (TF: 0.036~2.000 Hz), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA: frequency bandwidth of 0.3 Hz with peak respiratory frequency as median), and the PSD ratio in the PP and PR intervals (LF/HF, RSA/TF) were compared. Compared with day 0, a decrease in the LF/HF ratio and an increase in the RSA/TF ratio in PP intervals were observed at 1 month, consistent with expression of respiratory vagal activity. For PR intervals, on the other hand, the LF/HF ratio increased, indicative of accentuated sympathetic activity. However, the respiratory vagal input was weak, and the RSA/TF ratio remained unchanged. These observations suggest that, in PLBWI at 1 month, AVN conduction was not predominatly influenced by respiratory-related vagal activity, but was controlled by autonomic regulation, independent of the SAN.(PACE 2005; 28:S288-S291)","2005-01-02","2019-02-14 12:25:20","2019-02-14 12:25:20","","S288-91","","","28","","Pacing & Clinical Electrophysiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The questionnaire underwent expert review, content validity testing, revisions, translation into French and pre-testing. A proportionate stratified random sample of 30 percent was used for physicians. For midwives, a total population sample was taken in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec, and in Ontario a random sample of 30 percent was used. Using the Dillman protocol, each person in the sampling frame was contacted up to five times: pre-notice letter, first survey, reminder postcard, second survey, and third survey.Of the 1437 potential participants, 813 (56.6%) returned surveys. Of these, 1168 were eligible for the study and 516 (44.2%) completed surveys. Thirty-five percent of obstetricians, 42.7 percent of family practitioners and 21.4 percent of midwives recommended bed rest in hospital. Larger numbers recommended bed rest at home: 64.7 percent of obstetricians, 69.9 percent of family practitioners and 52.1 percent of midwives. Two-thirds of care providers indicated that bed rest was only 'fair to poor' in helping to prevent preterm birth. Cervical changes as compared to other warning signs of preterm labour led to increased use of bed rest at all gestational ages in singletons and multiples. Sixty-one percent of obstetricians, 71.7 percent of family physicians and 48.8 percent of midwives do NOT routinely recommend any sort of rehabilitative exercise program. The top five concerns about side effects associated with bed rest were deep vein thrombosis, stress, depression, sleep disturbances and economic problems. Care providers recommending bed rest have some decisional conflict as measured by the Provider Decision Process Assessment Instrument (mean score 30/60).Except for situations of multiple pregnancy, there is inconsistent practice in recommending bed rest. There is also inconsistency about the extent of activity restriction to recommend. This data provides some of the first Canadian perspective on the use of bed rest in pregnancy and the decisional conflict of care providers in recommending this therapy, and offers valuable background information for future clinical trials.","2006-01","2019-02-14 12:25:21","2019-02-14 12:25:21","","","212 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Alberta (Canada)","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAINR14047","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Mail; Prenatal Care; Survey Research; Bed Rest -- In Pregnancy; Content Validity; Exploratory Research; Labor, Premature -- Prevention and Control; Labor, Premature -- Risk Factors; Midwives; Physicians; Stratified Random Sample","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare. METHODS: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon's population. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked whether they shared a bed with their infant 'always,' 'almost always,' 'sometimes,' or 'never.' Frequent bedsharing was defined as 'always' or 'almost always'; infrequent was defined as 'sometimes' or 'never.' RESULTS: Of all new mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always: 14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1% sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among nonsmoking mothers. Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group. Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth certificates, weighted for nonresponse. CONCLUSIONS: Although a number of case series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants <8-11 weeks of age. Despite the preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners' anecdotal experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death 'suffocation' or 'overlay asphyxiation' simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of death. This 'diagnostic drift' may greatly complicate future studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants <3 months old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death, analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift. Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both, bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be delayed until 3 months of age.","2005-10","2019-02-14 12:25:21","2019-02-14 12:25:21","","e530-42","","4","116","","Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Odds Ratio; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Confidence Intervals; Bed Sharing; Univariate Statistics; Risk Assessment; Multivariate Analysis; Oregon; Random Sample; Smoking -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most prevalent phenomena in the pregnant women were: intermittent sleep (56,5%); functional dyspnea (51,6%); edema (37,1%); orthopnea (35,5%) and constipation (32,2%). The conduct guide's development made it possible to verify that the use of technologies is something accessible to Nursing and that the CIPE can contribute to a better organization of the nurse's actions during prenatal.","2006-09","2019-02-14 12:25:22","2019-02-14 12:25:22","","2p-2p","","3","5","","Online Brazilian Journal of Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Brazil; Prenatal Care -- Methods; Obstetric Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.","2018-01","2019-02-14 12:25:23","2019-02-14 12:25:23","","18-33","","1","55","","Annals of Clinical Biochemistry","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Adult; Middle Age; Scales; Aged; Glycoproteins -- Blood; Gonadotropins -- Blood; Menopause -- Physiology; Reference Values; Sex Hormones -- Blood; Social Readjustment Rating Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions. Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies.","2002-09","2019-02-14 12:25:23","2019-02-14 12:25:23","","617-629","","7","11","","Journal of Women's Health & Gender-Based Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; United States; Male; Women's Health; Drug Therapy -- Adverse Effects; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Pharmacogenetics; Pharmacokinetics; Pharmacy and Pharmacology; Sex Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attributes of women's circamensual structure have been explored in depth, particularly with regard to fertility/infertility and birth control. However, the role of 24-hour and other rhythms in health, disease, and treatment has been little studied. The symptom intensity of a variety of chronic medical conditions is rhythmic, as is the risk of severe events, such as stroke and myocardial infarct (MI). Improving the safety, efficacy, and preventive qualities of medications requires the understanding of how rhythms impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The therapeutic and adverse effects of prescription and nonprescription medications widely used by women can vary markedly with the (circadian) time of administration. Circadian rhythm-dependent differences in the safety of medications are particularly relevant to pregnant women; laboratory animal studies show that the fetal toxicity of various treatments varies not only with developmental stage but also with circadian time. Rhythm-dependent differences in the actions of medications are also of great importance to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, who are advised to ingest prescribed pharmacotherapy for osteopenia and osteoporosis in the morning to minimize the risk of adverse effects and, as a consequence, may elect to take other medications at times not recommended in the instructions for their use.

However, studies to date have not examined the role of psycho-social-behavioral variables as predictors of elevated CRH. The goal of this study was to use multiple measures to obtain a more comprehensive picture of chronic maternal stress in an effort to more adequately evaluate the relationships between CRH and psycho-social-behavioral variables.One hundred twenty women, less than 20 weeks of gestation, were recruited, consented, and enrolled into the study. One hundred women had blood samples collected at 14-20 weeks of pregnancy and assayed for CRH. Eighty-five participants completed and returned self-administered questionnaires at 14-20 weeks gestation. Measures included perceived stress, depression, anxiety, social support, domestic violence/abuse, optimism levels, coping styles, and work, sleep, and nutritional patterns.The findings indicate significant weak associations between CRH (low vs. high) and sleep hours/night, hours of standing/day, reports of adequacy of income to meet needs, and the coping styles of 'religion,' 'disengagement,' and 'humor' (p < .05). Logistic regression modeling identified three predictor variables (adequacy of income to meet needs, and coping styles of 'religion' and 'disengagement') accounting for 42.2% of the variance in CRH level.These findings are the first to examine psycho-social-behavioral variables as predictors of CRH level in pregnancy. Women who report that their family incomes do not meet their needs had almost three times the odds for high CRH levels. Women who used religion and disengagement coping styles also had higher odds (14 and 7, respectively) for high CRH levels. Psycho-social-behavioral factors, including those identified as weak predictors of elevated CRH in this study, warrant additional consideration preparatory to establishing interventions to prevent preterm birth.","2008-01","2019-02-14 12:25:24","2019-02-14 12:25:24","","","156 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Utah","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3316827","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Human; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological -- In Pregnancy; Childbirth, Premature -- Risk Factors; Coping; Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone -- Blood; Religion and Religions; Standing; Wit and Humor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used in this descriptive study to enroll neonates who were given continuous KC beginning soon after birth in the delivery room and continuing for 6 hours. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, abdominal temperature, and behavioral state were recorded each minute. SETTING: Data were collected in the delivery room and in a private labor room in tropical Cali, Colombia. PARTICIPANTS: Six 34-36-week preterm neonates with 5-minute APGAR scores of 6 or more were enrolled. Two neonates had grunting respirations before KC was begun. RESULTS: Temperature rose rapidly to thermoneutral range. With few exceptions, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits; grunting respirations in two neonates disappeared with warmed humidified oxygen and continuous KC. Sleep predominated, and neonates were discharged home by 48 hours being fully breastfed, suggesting that KC was an environment conducive to recovery from fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that KC beginning in the delivery room can be given safely and perhaps with benefit to 34-36-week gestation neonates who appear healthy at birth.

However, there has been limited study of biological mechanisms underlying behavioral predictors of PPD during pregnancy. Objectives: Considering the shared etiology of chronic stress amongst antenatal behavioral predictors, the primary goal of this pilot study was to examine associations among stress-related physiological factors (including GABA-ergic neurosteroids) and stress-related behavioral indices of anxiety during pregnancy. Methods: Fourteen nulliparous women in their second trimester of a singleton pregnancy underwent speech and mental arithmetic stress, following a 2-week subjective and objective recording of sleep-wake behavior. Results: Lower cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of ALLO + pregnanolone throughout the entire stressor protocol (area under the curve, AUC) were associated with greater negative emotional responses to stress, and lower cortisol AUC was associated with worse sleep quality. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone was associated with greater anxious and depressive symptoms. Stress produced paradoxical reductions in cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of allopregnanolone + pregnanolone, while tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were elevated. Conclusions: These data suggest that cortisol, progesterone, and ALLO + pregnanolone levels in the second trimester of pregnancy are inversely related to negative emotional symptoms, and the negative impact of acute stress challenge appears to exert its effects by reducing these steroids to further promote negative emotional responses.","2016-04","2019-02-14 12:25:25","2019-02-14 12:25:25","","1299-1310","","7","233","","Psychopharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A prospective cohort study of children from Western Australia was enrolled prior to birth and followed to age six. Two thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine children were recruited through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at age six allowing for a number of important confounders. These included gender, gestational age, smoking in pregnancy and early child care. After adjustment for confounders, the introduction of milk other than breastmilk before four months of age was a significant (p<0.05) risk factor for all asthma-related outcomes in six-year-old children: (i) doctor diagnosed asthma odds ratio{OR}=1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.54); (ii) wheeze three or more times since the age of one year OR 1.42 (1.15-1.76); (iii) wheeze in the last twelve months OR 1.28 (1.02-1.76); (iv) sleep disturbance due to wheeze within the last twelve months OR 1.41 (1.04-1.90); (v) age at doctor diagnosis (hazard ratio{HR}1.22 {1.03-1.43}); (vi) age at first wheeze (HR 1.36 {1.17-1.59}) and; (vii) positive reaction to common aeroallergens OR 1.27 (1.01-1.59). There is a substantial reduction in risk of childhood asthma as assessed at age six years, if exclusive breastfeeding is continued for at least the first four months of life.

Yet Healthy People 2010 BF objectives for exclusive BF remain unmet and prevalence is lowest for low-income populations. The purpose of this descriptive longitudinal study of 126 predominantly low income and ethnically diverse mother-infant dyads was to compare maternal and infant factors associated with nighttime BF behavior between exclusive BF dyads and supplemented dyads. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, independent t-tests, and Chi-square tests were used for analysis. BF behavior was categorized as either (1) exclusive BF, defined as 100% BF or breastmilk feeding on all three nights, or (2) supplementation, defined as any formula during any of the three nights.Compared to women in supplementation (n=59), women in exclusive BF (n=67) were older, more likely Caucasian, working at 36 weeks pregnant but not working at 1 month postpartum, in a relationship, and getting less help with baby at night. There was no group difference in objective sleep at the last month of pregnancy assessment. At one month postpartum, women in the supplementation group averaged 30 minutes less night sleep compared to women in the exclusive BF group.Compared to infants who were supplemented (n=54), infants who were exclusively breastfed (n=66) were significantly more likely to room-in with mothers in hospital and receive a home visit. They were statistically larger at birth, although the difference in size may not be clinically relevant.Assessment of sleep in new mothers is important for BF maintenance and more effort is needed to promote exclusive BF among younger women, African Americans and women of Asian descent. Rooming-in practice in the hospital after birth should be encouraged, as it was significantly associated with exclusive BF behavior at one month postpartum in this diverse sample of new families. Future research using a qualitative approach would be ideal to discover how nighttime feeding for new mothers evolves over time, their motivation for BF, and their network of influence in support of BF behavior. Findings from qualitative research will be useful in developing an effective intervention for BF maintenance.","2009-01","2019-02-14 12:25:26","2019-02-14 12:25:26","","","159 p","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Francisco","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3390041","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Sleep; Prospective Studies; Descriptive Research; Human; Age Factors; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; T-Tests; Socioeconomic Factors; Analysis of Variance; Blacks; Income; Asians; Breast Feeding -- Psychosocial Factors; Infant Formula; Maternal Behavior; Race Factors; Whites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients: 328 mothers reporting infant sleep problems at ageI 7 months. Mothers were recruited to the study when the infant was 4 months old but were only allocated to intervention or usual care if they reported infant sleep problems in a questionnaire administered at 7 months of age. Exclusions: infants born before 32 weeks' gestation; or mother's English too poor to complete self-report questionnaIre. Setting; Well child centres in six government areas (two low, two medIum and two hIghly disadvantaged), Melbourne, Australia. Recruitment October to November 2003. Intervention: Brief behavioural sleep intervention (n = 174) or usual well child care (n = 154). Sleep intervention was delivered by specially trained nurses who taught parents two main strategIes: either 'controlled crymg', where parents respond to the infant's cries at increased time intervals, or 'adult fading', where a parent sits with the infant until they fall asleep then slowly removes this presence over a few weeks. The nurse worked with the mother to develop an individual sleep management plan based on controlled crying, adult fading or simple strategies such as bedtime routine or pacifier use. Outcomes; Primary outcome: maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score community cut-off of >9 or clinical cut-off of > 12). Secondary outcomes: parenting practices (Parent Behaviour Checklist), child mental health (Child Behaviour Checklist) and mother's report of child sleep problems at 2 years or of persistent sleep problems (present at 10, 12 and 24 month assessments).

Specifically we wanted to answer the questions: (1) Are built spaces and features associated with maternity waiting home user satisfaction? (2) Can built spaces and features designed to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function improve maternity waiting home user satisfaction? And (3) Which built spaces and features are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction? Design A cross-sectional study comparing satisfaction with standard and non-standard maternity waiting home designs. Between December 2016 and February 2017 we surveyed expectant mothers at two maternity waiting homes that differed in their design of built spaces and features. We used bivariate analyses to assess if built spaces and features were associated with satisfaction. We compared ratings of built spaces and features between the two maternity waiting homes using chi-squares and t -tests to assess if design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function were associated with higher satisfaction. We used exploratory robust regression analysis to examine the relationship between built spaces and features and maternity waiting home satisfaction. Setting Two maternity waiting homes in Malawi, one that incorporated non-standardized design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy, and function (Kasungu maternity waiting home) and the other that had a standard maternity waiting home design (Dowa maternity waiting home). Participants 322 expectant mothers at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. first-time mothers and those with no pregnancy risk factors) who had stayed at the Kasungu or Dowa maternity waiting homes. Findings There were significant differences in ratings of built spaces and features between the two differently designed maternity waiting homes, with the non-standard design having higher ratings for: adequacy of toilets, and ratings of heating/cooling, air and water quality, sanitation, toilets/showers and kitchen facilities, building maintenance, sleep area, private storage space, comfort level, outdoor spaces and overall satisfaction ( p  = <.0001 for all). The final regression model showed that built spaces and features that are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction are toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space ( R 2 = 0.28). Key conclusions and implications for practice The design of maternity waiting home built spaces and features is associated with user satisfaction in women at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes, especially related to toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space. Improving maternity waiting home built spaces and features may offer a promising area for improving maternity waiting home satisfaction and reducing barriers to maternity waiting home use.","2018-07","2019-02-14 12:25:27","2019-02-14 12:25:27","","96-103","","","62","","Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Chi Square Test; Comparative Studies; T-Tests; Surveys; Regression; Bivariate Statistics; Expectant Mothers -- Malawi; Health Facilities -- Malawi; Hospital Design and Construction; Malawi; Patient Satisfaction -- In Pregnancy -- Malawi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Non-randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Regional neonatal unit. PATIENTS: Preterm infants before discharge. INTERVENTIONS: Nap PSG respiratory and sleep variables were measured including gastro-oesophageal pH. Nurse observations included respiratory distress, apnoea measured by apnoea alarm, oxygen saturation and heart rate. Infants were studied supine in a cot and then in a car seat. Nursing observations were compared with PSG during the car seat trial only. Criteria for failure of the PSG and observed tests were predefined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in respiratory instability between cot and car seat. Concurrence regarding failure of the car seat trial between nurse-observed data and PSG. RESULTS: 20 infants (median gestation 33 weeks (range 28-35 weeks; median postmenstrual age (PMA) at study 36.5 weeks (range 35-38 weeks)) were studied. There were sufficient car seat data on 18 infants for comparison. There were fewer central apnoeas and arousals in the cot than the car seat (p = 0.047 and p = 0.024, respectively). Airway obstruction was not more common in the car seat. Younger PMA at time of study predicted failure in both car seat (p = 0.022) and cot (p = 0.022). The nurse-observed test had low sensitivity for predicting PSG failure but more accurately predicted airway obstruction on PSG. CONCLUSIONS: Immature infants exhibit respiratory instability in cots and car seats. A car seat test does not accurately detect all adverse events during sleep in the seat.","2007-11","2019-02-14 12:25:28","2019-02-14 12:25:28","","F468-72","","6","92","","Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Fetal & Neonatal Edition","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Human; Polysomnography; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Diagnosis; Infant, Newborn; Male; Clinical Trials; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Diagnosis; Patient Discharge; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Prevention and Control; Infant, Premature; Equipment Safety -- Methods; Gastroesophageal Reflux -- Diagnosis; Gastroesophageal Reflux -- Etiology; Gastroesophageal Reflux -- Prevention and Control; Heart Rate; Infant Equipment -- Adverse Effects; Nursing Assessment -- Methods; Oxygen -- Metabolism; Respiratory Failure -- Diagnosis; Respiratory Failure -- Etiology; Respiratory Failure -- Prevention and Control; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Etiology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Prevention and Control; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Etiology; Supine Position","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence suggests that each affects the body's structure and function in ways that could increase susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction later in life. Here, we used 2 routine stress reactivity tests to identify incipient 'silent' programming of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with adverse perinatal events.Methods and Results -- We studied 29 control babies born at term to nonsmokers, 18 term-born babies of mothers who smoked throughout pregnancy (mean, 15 cigarettes a day), and 31 babies born preterm to nonsmokers. All infants were compared at the same age after conception (ie, at 40 to 42 weeks), during sleep. We analyzed blood pressure (BP) and heart rate responses to breathing 4% CO2 for 4 minutes or to passive head-up tilt to 60°. BP was measured continuously from a wrist cuff. CO2 exposure raised heart rate and BP in controls by 10%, and tilt increased their BP by 5%. CO2 elicited the expected BP but no heart rate response from preterm infants but a much-greater-than-expected BP and heart rate response from babies of smokers. Tilt elicited a 3- to 4-fold greater rise in BP from preterm and tobacco-exposed babies.Conclusions -- Vascular, cardiac, and blood pressure reactivity is heightened in babies born preterm or to smokers. The findings are consistent with in utero and early postnatal 'programming' of human cardiovascular dysfunction by adverse circumstances. This incipient dysfunction may be an early manifestation of processes that lead to other problems or complications later on (eg, higher BP or sudden infant death syndrome).","2008-10-28","2019-02-14 12:25:29","2019-02-14 12:25:29","","1848-1853","","18","118","","Circulation","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Smoking -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Infant; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Analysis of Variance; Kruskal-Wallis Test; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Labor, Premature; Blood Pressure; Autonomic Nervous System -- Physiology; Equipment and Supplies; Stress; Tilt-Table Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need for SIDS prevention programs tailored to the specific needs of parents of high-risk infants. The purpose of this study was to pilot test an online educational module addressing SIDS risk-reduction recommendations (RRRs) for parents of preterm infants. This study was conducted in a 44-bed transitional care unit at a level IV NICU in the Midwest. A repeated-measures design was used. Two weeks before discharge, mothers completed a survey, addressing knowledge and plans for caring for their baby at home. Mothers then viewed the 5-section Caring about Preemies' Safe Sleep (CaPSS) education module and completed the postmodule evaluation. A discharge survey was completed 4 weeks postdischarge. Fifteen mothers, mean age 26.4 years, participated; 8 (53%) returned the postdischarge survey. Module evaluation rated clarity and completeness of information high. Mothers' ratings of SIDS knowledge were significantly higher after viewing the module (P= .000) and 4 weeks after discharge home (P= .012). Mothers found the use of a pacifier at sleep times to be new information and changed their plans for caring for their infant, with 28.6% of mothers always offering a pacifier before sleep after discharge compared with the 6.7% who had planned to do this before discharge. However, only 71% of infants slept in parents' room after discharge and only 41% were receiving at least some breast milk, which are not consistent with SIDS RRRs.","2018-10","2019-02-14 12:25:29","2019-02-14 12:25:29","","366-372","","4","32","","Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Sudden Infant Death -- Prevention and Control; Adult; Human; Patient Compliance; Descriptive Statistics; Summated Rating Scaling; Surveys; Gestational Age; Repeated Measures; Health Promotion; Breast Feeding; Patient Discharge; Infant, Premature; Kangaroo Care; Health Knowledge -- Evaluation; Hospital Units; Infant Care -- Education; Infant Equipment; Midwestern United States; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers -- Education; Parents -- Education; Parents -- Psychosocial Factors; Pilot Studies; Program Evaluation; Sleep -- Education; Sudden Infant Death -- Education; Teaching Materials; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this population is an important and trusted source of information for pregnant women and may provide guidance on infant care. We explored these topics with certified nurse‐midwives to identify potential barriers as well as enabling and reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal health care environment. Methods: Participants in this cross‐sectional survey study were certified nurse‐midwives who provide prenatal health care to women in Ohio. Surveys were mailed to all certified nurse‐midwives listed with the licensing registry of the Ohio Board of Nursing (N = 333). Results: A total of 153 eligible respondents completed the survey for a response rate of 55%. Most participants had at least some knowledge of the infant safe sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and two‐thirds had positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. Many participants (61%) perceived that there were barriers to providing prenatal infant safe sleep education, but nearly all (94%) indicated that they were interested in providing this education to their patients. Positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education were predictive of whether they discussed this topic with their patients. Discussion: Certified nurse‐midwives routinely provide guidance on infant care, and it is important that they are familiar with current evidence‐based recommendations on infant safe sleep. They should be supported in their desire to provide infant safe sleep education to their prenatal patients. In addition, efforts should be made to improve attitudes and social norms related to providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment.","2018-04-03","2019-02-14 12:25:30","2019-02-14 12:25:30","","196-204","","2","63","","Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Summated Rating Scaling; Confidence Intervals; Sudden Infant Death; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Behavior; Nurse Midwives; Ohio; Professional Knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aim to reveal patterns of association among sleep–wake behaviors that are challenging in the life of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods:Through text-mining analyses, we numericized the transcripts of 59 caregiver’s informal, conversational interviews. That is, the relative frequencies-of-occurrences of words as well as their semantic specificities (italic) were clustered, categorized, and visualized for patterns. Results:A total of 4008 words were indexed wheresleeptook the 91st place of most important words.Sleepandwakewere however not associatively conversed throughout the interviews. Sleep-related words conversed were:night, nap, apnea, asleep, awake, bed, bedroom, bedtime, mattress, melatonin, overnight, andwake-up. Among some FASD-characteristic words describing the challenges were:huge, alcohol, manage*, stop, adopt, crazy*. The semantic space reflecting these challenges experienced in caring for children with FASD was divided into two axes: child-oriented vs. other-oriented words, and day-related and night-related words. The position of sleep shows that problematic sleep was expressed as a ‘family’ issue. Clumsy* was interrelated with problematic sleeping and waking. Despite that mostlynightwas associatively conversed, the association ofRoutines,Managing, andPlanningwithsleepunderscores the challenges faced. Conclusion:When conversing caregivers of children with FASD seldom interrelate ‘sleep’ but rather ‘night’ with FASD-characteristics.

We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence.Methods: Participants were pregnant women (N=56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores≥15 and clinician interview.Results: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p<.05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (χ(2)=0.98, p=.32).Conclusions: Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted.","2011-05","2019-02-14 12:25:44","2019-02-14 12:25:44","","378-384","","3","130","","Journal of Affective Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Risk Factors; Psychological Tests; Scales; Postnatal Period; Time Factors; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Sleep Disorders -- Complications; Depression, Postpartum -- Etiology; Depression, Postpartum -- Psychosocial Factors; Depression -- Blood; Depression, Postpartum -- Blood; Estradiol -- Blood; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Hydrocortisone -- Blood; Interleukins -- Blood; Postnatal Period -- Psychosocial Factors; Recurrence; Sleep Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interview about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances; standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI); actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM); and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen. RESULTS: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). Positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS; 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week; 45% had an IRLSS >20 and 100% had a PSQI >5. Hemoglobin levels <11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS. CONCLUSION: We found lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy.","2013-02-19","2019-02-14 12:25:45","2019-02-14 12:25:45","","738-742","","8","80","","Neurology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Restless Legs -- Epidemiology; Prevalence; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Estrogens -- Blood; Ferritin -- Blood; Hemoglobins -- Analysis; Pregnancy Complications -- Blood; Restless Legs -- Blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Child mental well-being at 8 years was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Binary outcomes were high 'internalizing' (anxious/depressive) and 'externalizing' (oppositional/hyperactive) problems (high was >90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were 'none'; 'early onset transient' (infancy/preschool only); 'persistent' (infancy/preschool and at school age); and 'late onset' (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old.Results: Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74, 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep, attenuated these associations.

Maternal anxiety and depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly for externalizing symptoms.

Methods: Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Mindell's Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Questionnaire. Results: Twenty-five percent of women reported high levels of childbirth fear and 20.6% reported sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Childbirth fear, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and anxiety were positively correlated. Fewer women attending midwives reported severe fear of childbirth than those attending obstetricians. Women with high childbirth fear were more likely to have more daily stressors, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as less help. Higher levels of anxiety predicted higher levels of childbirth fear among women. Conclusion: One fourth of women reported high childbirth fear. Women's fear of childbirth was related to fatigue, available help, stressors, and anxiety. Fear of childbirth appears to be part of a complex picture of women's emotional experiences during pregnancy.","2009-10-09","2019-02-14 12:25:47","2019-02-14 12:25:47","","567-576","","5","38","","JOGNN: Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Effect Size; Coefficient Alpha; Mail; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Regression; Childbirth; Analysis of Variance; Repeated Measures; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Anxiety -- In Pregnancy; Fatigue -- In Pregnancy; Multivariate Analysis; Parity; Exploratory Research; Bivariate Statistics; British Columbia; Fear -- In Pregnancy; Multivariate Analysis of Variance; Sleep Deprivation -- In Pregnancy; Stress, Psychological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mounting evidence documents associations of childhood abuse with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, to date, no study has evaluated associations of childhood abuse and sleep disturbances among pregnant women.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. To collect information regarding socio-demographic characteristics, history of childhood abuse, and complaints of sleep disturbances, face-to-face interviews were conducted with women in early pregnancy. Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST-S) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-S), translated from English to Spanish, were used to assess stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).Results: Women who experienced any childhood abuse had a 1.65-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.15-2.38) and 2.11-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.35-3.30) as compared with women who reported no abuse. Women who reported both physical and sexual abuse during childhood were more than twice as likely to suffer from stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.44-3.53) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.45-4.09) in comparison to women who reported no childhood abuse.Conclusions: A history of childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy.

However, these studies have not controlled for potential individual-, familial- and environmental-level confounders. Aim To determine the association between childhood maltreatment and lower sleep quality after adjusting for potential confounders. Methods Data for the present study were obtained from a pre-birth cohort study of 3778 young adults (52.6% female) of the Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy follow up at a mean age of 20.6 years. The Mater Hospital-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy is a prospective Australian pre-birth cohort study of mothers consecutively recruited during their first obstetric clinic visit at Brisbane's Mater Hospital in 1981-1983. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the 21-year follow up. We linked this dataset to agency-recorded substantiated cases of childhood maltreatment. A series of separate logistic regression models was used to test whether childhood maltreatment predicted lower sleep quality after adjustment for selected confounders. Results Substantiated physical abuse significantly predicted lower sleep quality in males. Single and multiple forms of childhood maltreatment, including age of maltreatment and number of substantiations, did not predict lower sleep quality in either gender in both crude and adjusted models. Not being married, living in a residential problem area, cigarette smoking and internalising were significantly associated with lower sleep quality in a fully adjusted model for the male-female combined sample. Conclusions Childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict young adult poor sleep quality, with the exception of physical abuse for males. While childhood maltreatment has been found to predict a range of mental health problems, childhood maltreatment does not appear to predict sleep problems occurring in young adults. Poor sleep quality was accounted for by concurrent social disadvantage, cigarette smoking and internalising.","2017-08","2019-02-14 12:25:48","2019-02-14 12:25:48","","879-888","","8","47","","Internal Medicine Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Child; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Adult; Human; Polysomnography; Male; Australia; Scales; Time Factors; Child Abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Cohort study in which participants were given a low infectious dose of rhinovirus (type RV39 or Hanks) and quarantined for 1 day before and 5 days after exposure. Setting: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Participants: 276 people (55% women, 81% white) aged 18-55 years who responded to a newspaper advertisement and were free of disease (based on examination and laboratory testing). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, currently lactating, or on regular medication. Assessment of risk factors: Acute and chronic life stressors based on scores from the Bedford College Life Events and Diffculties Schedule. Acute events lasted < 1 month and were a marked or moderate long term threat (eg, getting reprimanded at work). Chronic stressors lasted >/= 1 month, did not end > 6 months before assessment, and were a high moderate or marked long term threat (eg, ongoing unemployment); chronic physical illness stressors were not included. Other variables included health practices (smoking, exercise, sleep habits, alcohol use, and vitamin C and zinc intake), endocrine and immune function, social network ties, personality characteristics, and control variables (age, sex, race, education, body mass, baseline antibody levels, season, and virus type). Main outcome measures: Main outcome was having a cold, based on objective criteria for infection (isolation of virus or changes in serum antibody levels) and illness (mucous weights or mucociliary nasal clearance). Main results: 84% of participants showed evidence of infection, but only 40% had colds. 179 participants (65%) had >/=1 acute event in the previous year and 75 participants (27%) had chronic stressors. Analyses adjusted for control variables showed that participants who had chronic stressors in the previous year were more likely to get colds than those who did not (table); participants who had acute events in the previous year were not more likely to get colds (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 950/0 CI 0.76 to 2.55). Certain health practices (smoking, exercising </= 2 times/wk, poor sleep efficiency, </= 1 alcoholic drink/d, </= 85 mg vitamin C/d), hormone concentrations (increased norepinephrine concentrations), personality factors (introversion), and social network ties (low network diversity) were also associated with an increased risk of colds. The relation between chronic stressors and colds persisted after controlling separately for health practices, endocrine and immune markers, personality, and social network diversity (table). Conclusion: People who had chronic severe life stressors lasting >/= 1 month had increased susceptibility to colds compared with people who did not have chronic life stressors, but people who had acute stressful life events in the previous year did not have increased susceptibility.","1999-04","2019-02-14 12:25:49","2019-02-14 12:25:49","","54-54","","","","","Evidence Based Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Prospective Studies; Adolescence; Adult; Male; Middle Age; Risk Factors; Confidence Intervals; Stress, Psychological -- Complications; Life Style; Pennsylvania; Common Cold -- Etiology; Health Psychology; Psychoneuroimmunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The stress experienced during pregnancy and the associated antidepressant treatments can both affect fetal development. Fluoxetine (FLX) is among the most common antidepressants used by pregnant women. We have previously demonstrated that perinatal exposure to FLX can alter expression of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Here, we examine the combined effects of maternal stress during pregnancy and perinatal exposure to the antidepressant FLX on the circadian behavior of mice as adults. Methods: Mouse dams were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (embryonic (E) day 7 to E18), FLX (E15 to postnatal day 12), a combination of both stress and FLX, or were left untreated. At 2 months of age, male offspring were placed in recording chambers and circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed. Results: Mice exposed to prenatal stress (PS) had smaller light-induced phase delays. Mice exposed to perinatal FLX required more days to re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance of their light-dark cycle. Mice subjected to either perinatal FLX or to PS had larger light-induced phase advances and smaller phase advances to 8-OH-DPAT. FLX treatment partially reversed the effect of PS on phase shifts to late-night light exposure and to 8-OH-DPAT. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, in mice, perinatal exposure to either FLX, or PS, or their combination, leads to discernible, persistent changes in their circadian systems as adults.","2017-03","2019-02-14 12:25:49","2019-02-14 12:25:49","","793-804","","5","234","","Psychopharmacology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence linking circadian clock-related genes to pregnancy outcomes has been inconsistent. We sought to examine whether variations in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of circadian clock genes are associated with PA risk. Methods: Maternal blood samples were collected from 470 PA case and 473 controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip platform. We examined 119 SNPs in 13 candidate genes known to control circadian rhythms (e.g., CRY2, ARNTL, and RORA). Univariate and penalized logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios (ORs); and the combined effect of multiple SNPs on PA risk was estimated using a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS). Results: A common SNP in the RORA gene (rs2899663) was associated with a 21% reduced odds of PA (P < 0.05). The odds of PA increased with increasing wGRS (Ptrend < 0.001). The corresponding ORs were 1.00, 1.83, 2.81 and 5.13 across wGRS quartiles. Participants in the highest wGRS quartile had a 5.13-fold (95% confidence interval: 3.21-8.21) higher odds of PA compared to those in the lowest quartile. Although the test for interaction was not significant, the odds of PA was substantially elevated for preeclamptics with the highest wGRS quartile (OR = 14.44, 95%CI: 6.62-31.53) compared to normotensive women in the lowest wGRS quartile. Discussion: Genetic variants in circadian rhythm genes may be associated with PA risk. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings and to further elucidate the pathogenesis of this important obstetrical complication.","2015-12","2019-02-14 12:25:49","2019-02-14 12:25:49","","1480-1486","","12","36","","Placenta","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment; Biological Clocks; Abruptio Placentae; Disease Susceptibility; Genotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Proteins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objectives were to (a) measure changes in circadian phase and phase angle between salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep onset across the perinatal period; and (b) prospectively examine associations between circadian measures and depressed mood in women with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD).Methods: Twelve women (age±SD=26.9±5 years) who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) were studied from third trimester of pregnancy through postpartum week 6. Participants completed sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs and light sensors, and had mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) during 3 separate weeks of the perinatal period; they gave saliva samples at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum to determine DLMO phase.Results: Nine women had DLMO phase shifts ≥30 min. On average±SD, new mothers phase delayed 42±80 min (range=163 min phase delay to 144 min phase advance). The time interval between average actigraphic sleep onset and DLMO was shorter at 6 weeks postpartum compared to 3rd trimester in 9 of 12 women, indicating that most new mothers were going to bed closer to the onset of endogenous melatonin secretion. Circadian measures were associated with depressed mood at postpartum weeks 2 and 6.Limitations: These data are preliminary findings from a small sample and require replication.Conclusions: We observed individual differences in magnitude and direction of circadian phase shifts and their timing relative to sleep across the perinatal period. These measures were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These preliminary data indicate that changes in perinatal circadian rhythms may contribute to the development of postpartum mood disorders.","2013-09-25","2019-02-14 12:25:50","2019-02-14 12:25:50","","1103-1108","","3","150","","Journal of Affective Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Psychological Tests; Scales; Time Factors; Pregnancy Trimester, Third -- Psychosocial Factors; Sleep -- Physiology; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Circadian Rhythm; Melatonin; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Affect; Light; Saliva","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interestingly, alterations of circadian rhythms (i.e., shiftwork) have been correlated with increased risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia. In the last few years evidence is accumulating that the placenta may have a functional circadian system and express the clock genes Bmal1, Per1-2, and Clock. On the other hand, there is evidence that the human placenta synthesizes melatonin, hormone involved in the regulation of the circadian system in other tissues. Moreover, is unknown the role of this local production of melatonin and whether this production have a circadian pattern. Available information indicates that melatonin induces in placenta the expression of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, prevents the injury produced by oxidative stress, and inhibits the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) a gene that in other tissues is controlled by clock genes. In this review we aim to analyze available information regarding clock genes and clock genes controlled genes such as VEGF and the possible role of melatonin synthesis in the placenta.","2015-03-02","2019-02-14 12:25:51","2019-02-14 12:25:51","","1-10","","","2015","","Obstetrics & Gynecology International","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of biological and historical and clinical factors on the different aspect of sleep behavior and disturbances evaluated by the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Mothers of 1157 children (583 M, 574 F) aged 6.5 to 15.3 years (mean 9.8) completed the SDSC together with a questionnaire on demographic data about family composition, parent's education and professional activities, as well as clinical data about pregnancy, delivery and medical history of the child with specific questions regarding pathologies that could affect sleep; sleep habits of parents and children were also investigated. Global sleep disturbances measured as SDSC total score were affected by cc sleeping, early sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis, asthma and parents' sleep disorders. Early sleep disorders, asthma and parents' sleep disorders had a significant main effect on disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Sleep breathing disorders score was associated with the presence of cosleeping, adenotonsillitis, asthma, food allergy. Disorders of Arousal score was affected by early sleep disorders and parents' sleep disorders. There was a significant main effect of co-sleeping, early sleep disorder, adenotonsillitis, parents' sleep disorder on sleep-wake transition disorders score; of gender, parents' sleep disorder on Disorders of excessive somnolence score and of gender, early sleep disorder and parents' sleep disorder on Sleep hyperhydrosis score. Post-hoc comparisons showed that females vs. males have higher scores in Disorders of excessive somnolence score while males scored higher in Sleep hyperhydrosis score. A visual generalized model revealed that predictors for Total SDSC score are early sleep disorders, parents' sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis and asthma. Our results underline the role of genetic and neurobiological substrate on the development of children sleep, delineating the areas of the sleep that are involved and rising some suggestions on which factors could lead to different later sleep disturbances.","2000-12","2019-02-14 12:25:51","2019-02-14 12:25:51","","147-151","","4","2","","Sleep & Hypnosis","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Child; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Human; Male; Data Analysis Software; Risk Factors; Clinical Assessment Tools; Analysis of Variance; Univariate Statistics; Sleep Disorders -- In Infancy and Childhood; P-Value; Random Sample; Sex Factors; Parents; Habits -- In Infancy and Childhood; Italy; Sleep Disorders -- Etiology -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 50% of women with bipolar disorder, illness onset occurs at or within 1 year of menarche. Despite this pattern, most women with bipolar disorder are not accurately diagnosed until they have had a child and developed an episode of PPD. The occurrence of PPD in a patient with recurrent depression but no history of mania or hypomania should raise the index of suspicion for the presence of an underlying bipolar disorder. Medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder can result in side effects, such as sexual dysfunction or weight gain, and in drug-drug interactions. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills while sodium valproate may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most common cause of menstrual disturbance in women of reproductive age. Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not protect against bipolar disorder relapse. Thus, physicians must be proactive in protecting the mother from relapse. In general, physicians should use nonpharmacologic measures as much as possible, pharmacology when necessary, and consider electroconvulsive therapy when the risks of medications are too great. Psychotic, floridly manic, or profoundly depressed patients should be given medication, for which information concerning safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding exist. For less severe problems, nonpharmacologic strategies can be employed and include promoting the maintenance of healthy nutrition and activity, protecting social and activity/sleep rhythms, educating patients and their families on how to recognize a prodrome of illness, and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address mild symptoms of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse.","2004-08","2019-02-14 12:25:53","2019-02-14 12:25:53","","1-11","","8","9","","CNS Spectrums: The International Journal of Neuropsychiatric Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Bipolar Disorder; Comorbidity; Depression, Postpartum; Education, Continuing (Credit); Sex Factors; Recurrence; Bipolar Disorder -- In Pregnancy; Bipolar Disorder -- Therapy; Depression -- Etiology; Substance Abuse -- Etiology; Suicidal Ideation -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, repeated measure. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 16 infants and 8 parents in the co-bedded group, and 21 infants and 11 parents in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: Infants in the study group were co-bedded in incubators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline and posttesting for parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction measures; infant sleep-wake synchronicity; physiological measures; and stress cue measures during baseline and activity. MAIN RESULTS: Repeated measures 5 (time) x 2 (group) analysis of variance found significant differences in infant daily weight, feeding amount, and high-activity heart rate. There was no difference in parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction scores by group, except for higher baseline parental satisfaction scores in the co-bedded group. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the safety of co-bedding multiple-gestation infants in incubators but did not find any significant clinical improvement in infant or parental outcomes with co-bedding. Neonatal intensive-care unit providers should educate staff and parents about the potential benefits of co-bedding and consider developing policies and procedures for co-bedding in both incubators and cribs. Co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants may be provided as an adjunctive developmental care strategy if parents desire this intervention.","2003-06-05","2019-02-14 12:25:53","2019-02-14 12:25:53","","340-347","","3","32","","JOGNN: Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Behavior Rating Scales; Prospective Studies; Human; Convenience Sample; Infant, Newborn; Male; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Coefficient Alpha; Psychological Tests; Paired T-Tests; Clinical Trials; Record Review; Analysis of Variance; Repeated Measures; Bed Sharing; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Infant, Premature; Purposive Sample; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Body Weight -- Evaluation; Heart Rate -- Evaluation; Infant Warmers; Medical Records; Multiple Offspring; Observational Methods; Oxygen Saturation -- Evaluation; Parental Attitudes -- Evaluation; Sample Size; Southeastern United States; Type II Error","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal was to evaluate the safety, effect on infant clinical and developmental outcomes, and maternal satisfaction of co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants compared to traditionally bedded infants/mothers. A secondary purpose was to evaluate co-bedding and American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended 'back to sleep' behaviors in the same infants/mothers after discharge. A retrospective, comparative, descriptive design was used. Chart reviews and mailed written surveys were used to collect study data. Findings showed no significant differences in demographic variables or clinical and developmental outcomes between the total traditionally bedded and co-bedded groups. All mothers reported positive experiences with the NICU. Co-bedding may promote maternal bonding and has no negative clinical or developmental outcomes. Once policies and education are in place, parents should be offered the option to co-bed multiple-gestation infants in the NICU.

The Capable Adolescent Mothers (CAM) program is focused on helping adolescents who plan to keep and raise their children, who show a readiness for taking responsibility, and who are currently drug free to become capable in parenting skills, life skills, and job skills. Seventeen primarily African-American (n = 11) adolescents between the ages of 15 and 18 years, were videotaped during 34 infant-feeding episodes. The videotapes were analyzed using Barnard's Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale and compared to a national normative sample (NCAST scores). The CAM group scores (41.9) compared favorably to the NCAST scores (41.6) on the parent scale (sensitivity to cues, response to distress, social-emotional, and cognitive growth fostering). The CAM group child scores (clarity of cues, responsiveness to parent) were significantly lower than the NCAST group's scores, probably reflecting the expected lower response scores for infants compared to older children. The author also described the three adolescents who had low total scores and the three who had high total scores. Additionally, as a group, the adolescents did not seem to have a good sense of time; they had not developed routine times for feeding, sleep, and play.","1993-01","2019-02-14 12:25:55","2019-02-14 12:25:55","","3-3","","1","7","","AWHONN's Women's Health Nursing Scan","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Adolescence; Adolescent Health Services; Homelessness -- In Adolescence; Maternal Health Services; Parent-Infant Bonding -- In Adolescence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The convenience sample consisted of eight mother-infant pairs. At the initiation of the study, the infants ranged from 1,250 to 1,750 g, were born at 24 to 32 weeks gestation, were not on ventilator assistance, and were physiologically stable. Mothers spent a minimum of 4 hours each day holding their infants upright between their breasts, skin-to-skin. Physiologic monitoring demonstrated no significant changes in apnea, heart rate, or oxygen saturation during these sessions. Time spent in sleep and skin temperature were lower for the infant during kangaroo care but changes were not deemed clinically significant. The cognitive adaptation framework used to categorize maternal responses identified common expressions of helplessness, lack of control, and guilt during the first week after delivery. All mothers experienced an emotional crisis during the second week. By Week 3, mothers expressed increased comfort and control over their environment. All mothers reported that the experience of kangaroo care helped them to gain a sense of control and competency. The authors concluded that skin-to-skin contact activated a process of reconciliation and healing.

Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is frequently overlooked by health care providers, yet recent studies suggest there is an association between sleep disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, elevated serum glucose, depression, prolonged labor, and cesarean birth. Growing evidence indicates that the recognition and management of prenatal sleep disorders may minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well-being. This focused review of prenatal sleep disturbance literature suggests there are 3 main sleep disorders of interest: breathing-related sleep disorders (ie, habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea), restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. These sleep disorders are common in pregnancy and have maternal and fetal consequences if left untreated. This article describes sleep disorders of pregnancy, elucidates their relationship with maternal and neonatal outcomes, and presents current evidence regarding diagnostic and management strategies.","2013-07","2019-02-14 12:25:57","2019-02-14 12:25:57","","368-377","","4","58","","Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Restless Legs -- Drug Therapy; Insomnia -- Drug Therapy; Medline; PubMed; Education, Continuing (Credit); Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Prevention and Control; Pregnancy Outcomes -- Evaluation; Sleep Disorders -- Complications; Sleep Disorders -- In Pregnancy; Drug Therapy -- Contraindications; Insomnia -- Prevention and Control; International Classification of Diseases; Restless Legs -- Prevention and Control; Sleep Disorders -- Prevention and Control; Sleep Disorders -- Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG.

Design, Settings, and Participants: Cross-sectional Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)–based survey data from a community social service agency and survey data from primary care centers were compared using descriptive statistics. There were 166 community survey respondents, average age of 25 years (SD = 5.4 years), and 79 primary care center respondents, average age of 24 years (SD = 5.4 years). Two binary logistic regressions were performed to examine the association between demographic differences and safe sleep position/bed sharing. Results: Safe sleep position responses did not differ significantly between the community-based (n = 126, 85%) and primary care center–based (n = 62, 79%) samples, χ2(1) = 0.79, P = .372. Reported bed sharing was significantly higher in the community sample (n = 54, 36%) than the health care center sample (n = 4, 5%), Fisher’s exact test, P< .001. Black race was determined to be significantly associated with increased unsafe sleep positioning (OR = 2.86, P = .022). The community center cohort was the only significant predictor of bed sharing (OR = 25.40, P = .002). Conclusion:Differences in reported safe sleep environments may be due to knowledge variances of safe sleep guidelines, or clinic-based respondents may have been more likely to provide socially desirable responses. The comparison data further highlight the need for continued targeted effort to improve safe sleep behaviors to improve infant health outcomes.","2015-07","2019-02-14 12:25:58","2019-02-14 12:25:58","","205-210","","3","6","","Journal of Primary Care & Community Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients did not receive any medication affecting serum FBG levels at least for 2 weeks prior to the initiation of the study. Patients were assigned to receive 20 to 40 mg/day of fluoxetine or 75 to 200 mg/day of imipramine for 8 weeks. Benzodiazepines were allowed when needed for anxiety, agitation or sleep. Pregnant women, and patients with diabetes mellitus, and history of major heart diseases were excluded from this study. Additionally, none of the patients should have received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within 6 months prior to initiation of the antidepressants. FBG levels were measured at the initiation of study as well as 4 and 8 weeks after starting antidepressants.Results: Nineteen patients in the fluoxetine and 24 patients in the imipramine groups completed the study. In the fluoxetine group, FBG level was decreased from 88.5 mg/dL (baseline) to 85.0 mg/dL at week 4 (P=0.73), and to 79.8mg/dL at week 8 (P<0.001). On the other hand, in the imipramine group, FBG level was increased from 86.96 mg/dL (baseline) to 89.71 mg/dL at week 4 (P=0.079), and to 96.90 mg/dL at week 8 (P<0.001).Conclusion: This 8-weeks study showed that FBG levels may decrease in depressive patients receiving fluoxetine and may increase in those patients treated with imipramine. Therefore, it is suggested to measure and monitor FBG before initiation and during treatment with fluoxetine and imipramine.

Training based on continuous care model and telehealth has improved the quality of health care and may also ameliorate quality of sleep. Aim: The present study was conducted to compare the effects of training on the quality of sleep in pregnant women on the basis of continuous care model and telehealth. Method: This three-group clinical trial was performed in 2017 on 91 pregnant women visiting health centers in Mashhad, Iran. Orientation, sensitization, control and evaluation were carried out in the continuous care group, and four DVDs were watched by mothers in the telehealth group over the course of four weeks along with eight weeks of follow-up, and the routine care of health centers was administered for the control group. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was completed at the end of weeks 8 and 12 after the start of the study. Data were analyzed in SPSS version 24 using Kruskal-Wallis statistical test. Results: The three groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables (P<0.05). The Kruskal-Wallis test results showed that the mean quality of sleep score before the intervention was homogeneous among the three groups (P=0.42), but it was significantly different (P<0.001) immediately after the intervention in the three groups of continuous care (4.4±1.7), telehealth (4.4±1.4), and control (9.0±3.7), and there was a significant difference four weeks post-intervention in the three groups of continuous care (3.5±2.1), telehealth (5.3±1.8), and control (10.7±3.1) (P<0.001). Implications for Practice: Training based on the continuous care model and telehealth can improve the quality of sleep in pregnant women. Considering that telehealth is a simpler and easier method, it can be used to boost the quality of sleep in pregnant women.","2018","2019-02-14 12:25:59","2019-02-14 12:25:59","","35-44","","4","8","","Journal of Evidence-based Care","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Random Assignment; Randomized Controlled Trials; Iran; Kruskal-Wallis Test; Continuity of Patient Care; Sleep -- Standards -- In Pregnancy; Telehealth; Training Effect (Physiology)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The co-occurrence among non-pregnant cohorts is 30%-50% with increased risk for adverse health outcomes. To date, no study has examined the comorbid status or impact in pregnant women.Methods: The prevalence of insomnia (INS) and habitual snoring (HS) were examined in 439 women in the third trimester (34.1 ± 3.7 weeks). Habitual snoring (snoring ≥3 times/week) was self-reported. Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ).Results: Four groups emerged: HS-/ISQ- (n = 161; 36.7%), HS-/ISQ+ (n = 146; 33.3%), HS+/ISQ- (n = 63; 14.4%), and HS+/ISQ+ (n = 69; 15.7%). Logistic regression models revealed both independent associations, as well as comorbid HS/INS status with excessive daytime sleepiness (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.3-6.5, p < 0.001; aOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.4, p = 0.02; aOR 7.2, 95%CI 3.7-14.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Only comorbid HS/INS was associated with gestational hypertension (aOR 3.2 95%CI 1.0-10.6, p = 0.048). Insomnia alone and HS alone were associated with a baby born large for gestational age (aOR 2.9 95%CI 1.2-7.1, p = 0.019 and aOR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11.1, p = 0.034 respectively) but however, the comorbid state was not significantly associated with LGA. Only women with HS alone were at increased odds of having an unplanned cesarean section (aOR 2.2 95%CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.046).Conclusions: Both insomnia alone and comorbid insomnia/habitual snoring were associated with adverse outcomes even after accounting for confounders. These findings are clinically relevant since adverse pregnancy outcomes may have severe consequences for both mother and baby. In order to mitigate these outcomes, identifying viable treatment(s) for women at risk should be considered a high priority.","2018-06","2019-02-14 12:25:59","2019-02-14 12:25:59","","12-19","","","46","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that opening of hemichannels after cerebral ischemia may contribute to delayed evolution of injury. METHODS: We infused a mimetic peptide that blocks connexin 43 hemichannels into the lateral ventricle of chronically instrumented fetal sheep in utero at 128 ± 1 days gestation (term is 147 days), starting 90 minutes after 30 minutes of severe ischemia induced by reversible bilateral carotid artery occlusion, for either 1 or 25 hours. Sheep were killed 7 days later. RESULTS: Peptide infusion was associated with a graded improvement in recovery of electroencephalographic power after 7 days recovery, from -13 ± 1.9dB (n = 7) after ischemia-vehicle to -9 ± 1.6dB (n = 7) after ischemia-short infusion and -5 ± 1.6dB after ischemia-long infusion (n = 6, p < 0.05). Peptide infusion was associated with reduced seizure activity after ischemia, less frequent status epilepticus (p < 0.05), and earlier return of sleep state cycling (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion (but not ischemia-short infusion) was associated with improved survival of oligodendrocytes in intragyral and periventricular white matter (p < 0.05) and increased brain weight (p < 0.05). Ischemia-long infusion was associated with an intermediate estimate of surviving neurons in the parasagittal cortex of 2.9 ± 0.8 x 10(6) , in comparison to sham control (4.3 ± 0.9 x 10(6) ) or ischemia-vehicle (1.5 ± 0.4 x 10(6) ; p < 0.05 vs sham control).

Accordingly, a task force was chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. A committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12 consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including reassurance, exercise and avoidance of exacerbating factors, are outlined. A rationale for iron supplementation is presented. Medications for RLS/WED are risk/benefit rated for use during pregnancy and lactation. A few are rated ""may be considered"" when RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches. An algorithm summarizes the recommendations.

Research examining the relationship between past and recent violence exposure and mental health suggests that the effects of childhood adversity are especially pernicious, but to date, no studies have attempted to disentangle the direct, indirect and relative effects of past year versus childhood exposure to violence and adversity on sleep. The objective of the current study was to examine the direct effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and past year intimate partner violence (IPV) on different aspects of sleep health in pregnant women. Method: A sample of high-risk pregnant women (n = 101) were interviewed. Mediation analysis with bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals was used to evaluate direct and indirect effects. Results: Findings indicated that while ACEs had significant direct effects on mental health, past year IPV had stronger effects on sleep quality, latency, and efficiency. ACEs did, however, indirectly affect subjective sleep quality via past year psychological IPV. Conclusion: These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may be a regulatory stress response that is most clearly linked to past year violence and trauma. That is, though long-term sleep disturbance may be evident following childhood adversity, it is likely that this relationship is better explained by the role of childhood adversity in predicting adulthood revictimization or due to long-term mental health difficulties associated with early trauma.","2017-09","2019-02-14 12:26:00","2019-02-14 12:26:00","","587-595","","5","9","","Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice & Policy","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Child; Adult; Human; Expectant Mothers; Confidence Intervals; Mental Health; Exposure to Violence; Life Change Events -- In Infancy and Childhood; Trauma","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abstract Objective To examine whether there is a consensus on what guidance to share with expectant fathers from the prenatal through early infancy period among a multidisciplinary group of professionals with expertise on father involvement. Design Consensus-building approach using mixed methods involving two rounds of data collection. In Round 1, participants were requested to individually generate content as text messages to share with expectant fathers that a father should know or do for his infant, his partner, and himself starting prenatally and through early infancy. A content analysis of Round 1 data was conducted to identify domain content to share with fathers. During Round 2, experts were asked to rate their perceived level of importance of the content generated in Round 1. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means, and standard deviations were calculated for Round 2. Setting Electronic survey. Participants Nine multidisciplinary professionals with expertise on father involvement, representing psychology, pediatrics, nursing/midwifery, and sociology. Measurements and findings During Round 1, participants individually generated 302 message content items across domains in the following contexts: plan for/participate in birth (n = 71); his infant (n = 95); his partner (n = 107); and himself (n = 38). During Round 2, participants achieved greatest consensus in more content items in two contexts: infant support and partner support. For infant support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with for fathers included: knowledge about signs of infant illness, feeding, sleep patterns, and impact of second hand smoke/drug use; training on providing newborn care; and taking action including participating in infant care, providing verbal stimulation, engaging in age-appropriate play and physical contact, supporting safe sleep, and making/attending doctor appointments. For partner support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with fathers included: communicating with partners with regular check-ins, and about parenting styles and shared responsibilities, signs/symptoms of maternal depression, and hopes/dreams for infant; and taking actions to support partner's physical and emotional health and breastfeeding. Although less content was generated in the other two contexts - plan for/participate in birth and father support - participants achieved consensus on some content in these domains as being important to share with fathers. Key conclusions Despite lack of professional guidelines for expectant fathers, experts generally agreed on the content that should be shared with expectant fathers from pregnancy through early infancy, especially in the domains of infant support and partner support. Implications for practice This study can assist clinicians and practitioners on guidance to share with expectant fathers during their partner's pregnancy and the early postnatal period. Dissemination of such guidance to fathers can assist in benefiting all members of the family.","2019-03","2019-02-14 12:26:01","2019-02-14 12:26:01","","119-126","","","70","","Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interrater Reliability; Human; Funding Source; Male; Descriptive Statistics; Prenatal Care; Infant Care; Counseling; Support, Psychosocial; Content Analysis; Smoking -- Complications; Attitude of Health Personnel; Communication; Consensus; Data Collection Methods; Ethanol -- Adverse Effects; Expectant Fathers -- Education; Infant Food; Multidisciplinary Care Team; Obstetric Care; Spouses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In this observational study, 144 women reported on demographics, (prepregnancy) body weight, and lifestyles in self-reported questionnaires at 30 weeks gestation. Body weight at the end of pregnancy (self-reported at 6 weeks postpartum) was used to determine total gestational weight gain. Multivariate prediction models were developed to identify factors associated with total gestational weight gain and excessive gestational weight gain (i.e., higher weight gain than recommended by the Institute of Medicine). RESULTS: Women gained 14.4 (+/-5.0) kg during pregnancy. Obese women gained almost 4 kg less than normal weight women. Pregnant women judging themselves to be less physically active or women who reported increased food intakes during pregnancy gained significantly more weight. Over one third of women (38%) gained more weight than recommended. Being overweight, judging yourself to be less physically active than others, and a perceived elevated food intake during pregnancy were significantly associated with excessive weight gain (odds ratio [OR] = 6.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01-19.32; OR = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.55l, 10.15; and OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.18, 8.36, respectively). A higher age at menarche and hours of sleep reduced the odds for excessive weight gain (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99; and OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mean hours of sleep, perceived physical activity, and measures of food intake at 30 weeks gestation were identified as modifiable behavioral correlates for excessive gestational weight gain. Strategies to optimize gestational weight gain need to be explored, with a focus on the identified factors.","2009-10","2019-02-14 12:26:01","2019-02-14 12:26:01","","1559-1566","","10","18","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Sleep; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Age Factors; Body Weight; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Self Report; Confidence Intervals; Practice Guidelines; Nonexperimental Studies; Multivariate Analysis; Behavioral Changes; Food Intake; Life Style, Sedentary; Menarche; Multiple Linear Regression; Multiple Logistic Regression; Netherlands; Obesity -- Risk Factors; Weight Gain -- Risk Factors -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A greater number of iCVH components in adolescence are related to better cardiovascular health, but little is known about the correlates of iCVH in adolescents. Thus, the aim of the study was to examine correlates of iCVH in European adolescents.Methods and Results: The study comprised 637 European adolescents with complete iCVH data. Participants were part of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, a cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted in 9 different European countries. Correlates investigated were sex and age, family affluence scale, maternal education, geographic location, sleep time, television viewing, duration of pregnancy, birth weight and breastfeeding. Younger adolescents, those whose mothers had medium/high education or those who watched television less than 2 h per day had a greater number of iCVH components compared to those who were older, had a mother with low education or watched television 2 h or more daily (P ≤ 0.01).Conclusion: Since in our study older adolescents had worse iCVH than younger adolescents, early promotion of cardiovascular health may be important. Future studies may also investigate the usefulness of limiting television viewing to promote iCVH. Finally, since adolescents of mothers with low education had poorer iCVH, it may be of special interest to tailor public health promotion to adolescents from families with low socioeconomic status.","2018-02","2019-02-14 12:26:02","2019-02-14 12:26:02","","187-194","","2","28","","Nutrition, Metabolism & Cardiovascular Diseases","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fourth purpose is to learn about the timing and topics for presentation of educational materials, and about support systems during pregnancy.Twenty-three low-income, first time mothers completed the two week feeding and teaching session, using the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST) feeding scale. Nineteen mother-infant dyads completed both the two week and six week feeding observations and the exit interview. Sixteen mothers completed the Sleep Activity Record (SAR).Statistically significant (p < .05) results from the feeding observation are as follows: (a) mothers who had more education had a higher caregiver total score at two weeks and six weeks, (b) infants of mothers with more education had a higher infant total score at two weeks, and (c) the dyad had a higher total contingency (reciprocal interaction) score at two weeks. Mothers in households with higher levels of income had higher contingency scores at 6 weeks, and the change in the contingency score from two to six weeks was positive for mothers with more income. The cluster of positive findings related to the SAR is that infants who had a higher total score at 2 weeks received more feedings at 3-4 weeks.Mothers reported that the medical and health education information of the nurses was valuable during the pregnancy and after the birth of the baby. Mothers appreciated the social support of the nurses and credited them with being an important part of the support network.A larger sample size pooled from multiple sites, a longer time period for intervention and data collection, and serial SAR recordings might yield more significant results. Further investigation into topics covered, the timing of education for pregnant and parenting women, and the role of social supports may provide information to shape policy and funding considerations.","2003-01","2019-02-14 12:26:02","2019-02-14 12:26:02","","","145 p","","","","","","","","","","Colorado State University","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3114673","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Interviews; Sleep; Human; Scales; Educational Status; Infant Feeding; Diaries; Mother-Infant Relations; Income; Observational Methods; Community Health Nursing; Health Education; Home Visits; Perinatal Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need to understand salient correlates of these activity behaviours in a specific population. However, few studies identified socio-demographic, behavioural, physical, and psychological correlates of objectively-assessed physical activity and sedentary time in young adults.Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants in the Raine Study (a pregnancy cohort started in 1989). Australian young adults (mean 22.1 years ± SD 0.6) wore Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the hip 24 h/day for seven days to assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (n = 256 women, n = 219 men). Potential correlates were assessed via clinical assessment and questionnaire and included socio-demographic variables (ethnicity, relationship status, work/study status, education, mothers education), health behaviours (food intake, alcohol consumption, smoking status, sleep quality), and physical and psychological health aspects (anthropometrics, diagnosed disorders, mental health, cognitive performance). Backwards elimination (p < 0.2 for retention) with mixed model regressions were used and the gender-stratified analyses were adjusted for demographic variables, waking wear time and number of valid days.Results: Increased time spent in MVPA was associated with: being single (IRR 1.44 vs in a relationship living together, 95%CI: 1.17, 1.77, p = .001) in women; and better sleep quality in men (lower scores better IRR 0.97, 95%CI: 0.93, 1.00). Less time spent sedentary was associated with: lower mother's education (- 32.1 min/day, 95%CI -52.9, 11.3, p = 0.002 for having mother with no university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and smoking (- 44.3 min/day, 95%CI: - 72.8, - 15.9, p = .0002) for women; lower education status (- 32.1 min/day, 95%CI: -59.5, - 4.8, p = 0.021 for having no university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and lower depression scores in men (- 2.0, 95%CI: - 3.5, - 0.4, p = 0.014); more alcoholic drinks per week for women (- 1.9 min/day, 95%CI: -3.1, - 0.6, p = 0.003) and men (- 1.0, 95%CI: -1.8, - 0.3, p = 0.007).Conclusions: Less desirable correlates were associated with positive levels of activity in young Australian adult women and men. Interventions to increase MVPA and decrease sedentary activity in young adults need to specifically consider the life stage of young adults.","2018-07-25","2019-02-14 12:26:03","2019-02-14 12:26:03","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","1","18","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have confirmed the importance of sleep disturbances as a risk factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the need for screening and treatment of inadequate sleep. These reports, however, did not examine health-related quality of life which may be affected by sleep long before adverse clinical consequences are detectable in women during pregnancy. Objectives To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between sleep and health-related quality of life in pregnant women. Design A prospective observational study. Setting A university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan and participants’ homes. Participants A total of 164 pregnant women completed questionnaires and wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 days each trimester. Methods Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy, subjective sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-12v2 questionnaire across three trimesters. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between sleep and health-related quality of life. Results Sixty-four (39.0%) women consistently had an average sleep efficiency < 85% by actigraphy and 40 (24.4%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score > 5 in all three trimesters. Cross-sectionally, more actigraphic daytime sleep ( p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better physical health-related quality of life in first-trimester pregnant women. Better actigraphic sleep efficiency ( p = 0.04) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in second-trimester pregnant women. Longer actigraphic total nighttime sleep ( p < 0.01) and better subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in third-trimester pregnant women. Longitudinally, first-trimester actigraphic total nighttime sleep ( p < 0.05) and subjective sleep quality ( p < 0.01) predicted mental health-related quality of life in the second and third trimester. Conclusions Sleep disturbances are a highly prevalent and persistent problem in pregnant women. Adequate sleep is essential for women at all pregnancy stages and improving nocturnal sleep quantity and quality in early gestation is of utmost importance for an optimal health-related quality of life later in pregnancy.","2016-04","2019-02-14 12:26:04","2019-02-14 12:26:04","","45-53","","","56","","International Journal of Nursing Studies","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Human; Expectant Mothers; Scales; Taiwan; Health Status -- In Pregnancy; Quality of Life -- In Pregnancy; Mental Health; Academic Medical Centers; P-Value; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimesters; Home Environment; Multiple Linear Regression; Actigraphy; Sleep Disorders -- Epidemiology -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: A prospective descriptive study with within-subject design. SETTING: A university-affiliated hospital and participants' home environments. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight third trimester nulliparous women completed sleep and depressive symptom questionnaires, wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 consecutive days, and kept a concurrent diary reporting naps and rating their level of fatigue using a 0-10 visual analogue scale each morning, midday, afternoon, and evening. A generalized estimating equation regression model was applied to evaluate the time-dependent association. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mean duration of total nighttime sleep by actigraphy was 386.3 ± 60.7 min, with 11 (28.9%) women having an average total nighttime sleep < 6 h. Nineteen women (50%) napped > 3 days, and only 2 women did not nap over the entire week. Antecedent night sleep duration had a significant inverse association with morning (P = 0.022) and afternoon fatigue (P = 0.009) of the subsequent day. Self-reported naps were significantly associated with midday fatigue (P = 0.003). More depressive symptoms predicted more severe fatigue throughout the day. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that interventions designed to increase sleep duration and decrease depressive symptoms have the potential to prevent, ameliorate, or reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Depressive symptoms during pregnancy likely share some psychological and behavioral tendencies with fatigue and/or sleep disturbance which may complicate the evaluation of intervention effect.

These include face-voice stimuli of mothers and strangers, newborn cry sounds and instrumental and vocal music. Newborns of depressed mothers are also noted to be less attentive and responsive when presented with inanimate stimuli, including different texture nipples, different temperature nipples and different weight tubes. Potential underlying mechanisms are suggested by research showing negative effects of prenatal depression, elevated prenatal cortisol and lower prenatal dopamine and serotonin on the newborns of depressed mothers. Additional risk factors are explored, including sleep disturbances and other prenatal stressors. Early interventions, including pregnancy massage, massage therapy for infants and demonstration of the Brazelton Assessment, have been noted to enhance the neonates' attentiveness and responsivity to animate and inanimate stimuli. Limitations of these studies are discussed, including the sample being limited to lower SES women who have many other problems that potentially affect newborns. More controlled studies are needed to assess potential mediating factors for the inferior performance of these newborns on perceptual tasks such as limited attentiveness and/or greater arousal as well as longitudinal follow-up studies to determine whether these limited perceptual abilities continue into infancy.

Exclusions: psychotropic or hormonal medication, pregnancy, breastfeeding, compromised ovarian function, or substance abuse. Risk factors: Data were collected during six assessments, approximately every 8 months. Trained researchers collected blood samples for hormone assays (obtained between days 2 and 6 of consecutive menstrual cycles); administered a structured interview to assess general health status and behaviour, and the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Major depressive disorder was assessed according to DSM-IV criteria. At each interview, menopausal status was determined. Outcomes: Depressive symptoms (CES-D a cut off score of >/=16 defined high depressive symptoms); MDD; menopausal status determined with the Staging System for Reproductive Aging in Women (premenopausal: regular 22-35 day menstrual cycle; early menopause: change in cycle length by more than a week for two cycles; late menopause: absence of menstruation for 3-11 months; postmenopausal: absence of menstruation for more than 12 months); predictor variables (including hot flashes, sleep pattern, employment status, history of depression, PMS severity).MAIN RESULTS:Data are presented for 76% of the original sample (332 women). 21% of women had a history of depression at baseline. At 4 years, 3% were postmenopausal, 3% in late menopause, 21% in early menopause, and 73% remained premenopausal. Depressive symptoms were more likely during early and late transition to menopause than pre or post menopause.

However, it is not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience.","2008-02","2019-02-14 12:26:21","2019-02-14 12:26:21","","43-48","","1","11","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Pregnancy; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Middle Age; Descriptive Statistics; Effect Size; Psychological Tests; Scales; Aged; Severity of Illness Indices; Mann-Whitney U Test; Depression, Postpartum -- Diagnosis; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Depression, Postpartum -- Symptoms; DSM; Structured Interview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical examination of flow limitation relies on identifying patterns of airflow contour, however this process is subjective and lacks physiological evidence of UA narrowing. Our objective is to derive the temporal features of nasal airflow contour that characterize flow limitation. The features that correlate with UA narrowing can be used to develop machine learning classifiers to detect flow limitation with physiological support.Methods: Sixteen healthy adult men underwent full daytime polysomnography where the nasal airflow was recorded. Before and after sleep, we measured UA anatomical parameters including neck circumference (NC) and upper-airway cross-sectional area (UA-XSA). We extracted various temporal features of airflow and investigated their relationships with the UA anatomical parameters.Results: We found that three features were correlated with the anatomical parameters associated with UA narrowing: deviation index vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.67, p = 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.69, p < 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. ΔNC (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) and peak number vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.54, p = 0.04).Conclusions: Temporal features of airflow were associated with UA narrowing. Future studies could utilize the features to develop classifiers to detect flow limitation and assess the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in high-risk populations such as pregnant women and children.","2018-08","2019-02-14 12:26:22","2019-02-14 12:26:22","","70-78","","","48","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to: (a) calculate the prevalence of sleep disorder during pregnancy, (b) examine the difference in sleep quality among three trimesters, and (c) identify determinants of sleep quality in pregnant women.Materials and Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. Five hundred pregnant women were recruited at the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynecology of two teaching hospitals in central China. Five selfreport questionnaires were used for gathering data, including information of sample characteristics, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), prenatal depression (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)).Results: A total of 454 pregnant women participated in the study between September 2016 and April 2017. Eighty-seven percent pregnant women experienced sleep disorder (PSQI score >5). Poorer global sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, lower sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances were most prevalent during third trimester. The significant contributors to sleep quality for pregnant women were prenatal depression, maternal age, and gestational age.Conclusions: Sleep disorder is very common in pregnant women from China. Depressive symptoms, increased maternal age, and gestational age are determinants of sleep quality. These determinants can assist healthcare professionals in preventative intervention.","2018-11-15","2019-02-14 12:26:22","2019-02-14 12:26:22","","2980-2985","","22","31","","Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Adult; Young Adult; Prevalence; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Trimesters; China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to evaluate the Berlin and ESS in pregnancy and to determine whether an alternative screening approach could better detect sleep apnea in pregnant women. METHODS: Pregnant women at high risk for sleep apnea (women with chronic hypertension, pre-gestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) completed a sleep survey composed of the Berlin and ESS, and participated in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch-PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted device designed to diagnose sleep apnea, defined as an apnea hypopnea index >= 5. Using multivariable statistics, demographic, clinical, and subjective symptoms that were independently associated with sleep apnea were determined and a prediction rule for the presence of sleep apnea was developed. The predictive capacity of this newly developed system was compared to that of the Berlin and ESS using receiver-operating curve (ROC) statistics. RESULTS: Of the 114 women who participated and had a valid WP100 study, 100 completed the Berlin and 96 the ESS. The Berlin and ESS did not accurately predict sleep apnea in this high-risk pregnancy cohort, with ROC area under the curves (AUC) of 0.54 (p = 0.6) and 0.57 (p = 0.3), respectively. Conversely, a model incorporating frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, age, and body mass index performed significantly better (AUC 0.86, p > 0.001). CONCLUSION: The Berlin and ESS are not appropriate tools to screen for sleep apnea in high-risk pregnant women. Conversely, our four-variable model more accurately predicts sleep apnea in pregnancy.

Methods: Magnetocardiograms of 114 healthy fetuses (21-40 weeks of gestation) were recorded. Level of fetal activity (quiet/active sleep) was estimated according to characteristic heart rate patterns. Autocorrelation functions of (i) fetal heart rate and (ii) time patterns of SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal intervals) were calculated and autocorrelation was determined over different time scales. Age and activity related changes were examined using linear regression and non-parametric tests. Results: During pregnancy, autocorrelation increased in fetal heart rate signals and time patterns of SDNN and RMSSD. Short-time correlation (0-20 s) changed between 21 and 31 gestational weeks. Long-time correlation (75-300 s) accelerated later in pregnancy and did not increase in quiet heart rate patterns. Strong state-dependent changes were found with time patterns of SDNN. Conclusions: Emerging integrative ANS functions are reflected in increasing autocorrelation of fetal heart rate fluctuations over increasing time scales. The period from 21 to 31 gestational weeks seems to be critical to ANS development. Increasing long-time correlation is specific to active sleep states.","2012-11","2019-02-14 12:26:24","2019-02-14 12:26:24","","659-667","","6","40","","Journal of Perinatal Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Fetus; Human; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Linear Regression; Mann-Whitney U Test; Fetal Development; Heart Rate; Autonomic Nervous System","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex >or=95th percentile) at age 3. We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child pairs breastfed for <12 m, and 31% of infants slept <12 h/day. Among the 3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model, the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact on prevention of childhood overweight.","2008-07","2019-02-14 12:26:25","2019-02-14 12:26:25","","1651-1656","","7","16","","Obesity (19307381)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Logistic Regression; Adult; Human; United States; Male; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Risk Assessment; Pregnancy Trimesters; Massachusetts; Weight Gain; Smoking; Obesity -- Prevention and Control; Breast Feeding -- Adverse Effects; Obesity -- Etiology; Obesity -- Physiopathology; Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondary causes of RLS and the characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management strategies for RLS are summarized. Methods: The review began with a comprehensive PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy, obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications. Results and Conclusions: Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the disorder.","2014-08","2019-02-14 12:26:27","2019-02-14 12:26:27","","1441-1460","","8","30","","Current Medical Research & Opinion","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Human; Restless Legs -- Diagnosis; PubMed; Systematic Review; Restless Legs -- Complications; Combined Modality Therapy; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Management; Professional Practice, Evidence-Based; Restless Legs -- Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A secondary analysis of a descriptive, longitudinal study was done. A convenience sample of 31 pregnant women was used to test the hypothesis that multigravidae would have significantly higher levels of functioning in the household, increased fatigue, and decreased sleep efficiency and vitality than primigravidae at both phases of the study. Results indicate, however, that primigravidae experienced significantly more disturbed sleep, with sleep efficiency falling from 89.79% in the third trimester to 77.25% postpartum. Multigravidae had only a minor reduction in sleep efficiency from 86.76% in the third trimester to 83.99% postpartum. Although there was no statistically significant difference in level of vitality, primigravidae experienced more fatigue (73.58 +/- 15.22) than multigravidae (64.35 +/- 18.96) at 1 month postpartum. These results suggest that maternal role 'acquisition,' experienced by primigravidae, results in more fatigue and sleep disruption than does maternal role 'expansion.' The significant decrease in sleep efficiency and increase in fatigue in primigravidae after delivery indicate that health care professionals need to provide anticipatory guidance to primigravidae to help smooth the transition from pregnancy to motherhood.","1996-09","2019-02-14 12:26:27","2019-02-14 12:26:27","","364-367","","5","41","","Journal of Nurse-Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Postnatal Period; Primiparas; Research Instruments; Fatigue -- In Pregnancy; Electroencephalography; Sleep Disorders -- In Pregnancy; Functional Status -- In Pregnancy; Multiparas; Secondary Analysis; Two-Way Analysis of Variance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current reviews exploring the neurodevelopmental effects of IUGR, however, are mostly based on birthweight, an inadequate proxy.Objective: We aimed to examine the association between IUGR documented in utero, and neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood.Search Strategy: Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published after 1970.Selection Criteria: The analysis included studies that identified IUGR in utero, with follow-up assessments between 1 month and 12 years of age.Data Collection and Analysis: Data was extracted for cognitive, behavioural, language, motor, hearing, vision or sleep outcomes. Studies were summarised separately for children born at <35 and ≥35 weeks gestation.Main Results: Of 28 876 titles identified, 38 were suitable for inclusion. IUGR children born ≥35 weeks gestation scored on average 0.5 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children born <35 weeks of gestation scored approximately 0.7 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution (preferential perfusion of the brain) had more severe neurodevelopmental impairments than those born IUGR alone.Conclusions: IUGR increases the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment during childhood differentially across domains. IUGR children born preterm or with evidence of fetal circulatory redistribution are more severely affected.Tweetable Abstract: IUGR is associated with an overall risk for neurodevelopmental delay in a range of neurodevelopmental domains.","2015-07","2019-02-14 12:26:28","2019-02-14 12:26:28","","1062-1072","","8","122","","BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Child; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Risk Factors; Sleep Disorders -- Epidemiology; Gestational Age; Developmental Disabilities -- Epidemiology; Child, Preschool; Fetal Growth Retardation -- Epidemiology; Child Behavior Disorders -- Epidemiology; Cognition Disorders -- Epidemiology; Hearing Disorders -- Epidemiology; Language Disorders -- Epidemiology; Motor Skills Disorders -- Epidemiology; Vision Disorders -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overweight and obesity are known to be associated with many adverse health conditions in the preconception period, during pregnancy and during the labour and postpartum period. There are no current guidelines to suggest which preconception health programs and interventions are of benefit to these women and their infants. It is important to evaluate the available evidence to establish which preconception interventions are of value to this population of women. To evaluate the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions for improving pregnancy outcomes in overweight and obese women. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised controlled trials (including those using a cluster-randomised design), comparing health programs and interventions with routine care in women of reproductive age and a BMI greater then or equal to 25 kg/m(2). Studies published in abstract form only, were not eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised trials or randomised trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. The intervention in such studies would involve an assessment of preconception health and lead to an individualised preconception program addressing any areas of concern for that particular woman.Preconception interventions could involve any or all of: provision of specific information, screening for and treating obesity-related health problems, customised or general dietary and exercise advice, medical or surgical interventions. Medical interventions may include treatment of pre-existing hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance or sleep apnoea. Surgical interventions may include interventions such as bariatric surgery. The comparator was prespecified to be standard preconception advice or no advice/interventions. We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The search identified one study (published in four trial reports) which was independently assessed by two review authors and subsequently excluded. There are no included trials. We found no randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of preconception health programs and interventions in overweight and obese women with the aim of improving pregnancy outcomes. Until the effectiveness of preconception health programs and interventions can be established, no practice recommendations can be made. Further research is required in this area.","2015-07","2019-02-14 12:26:29","2019-02-14 12:26:29","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","7","","","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Systematic Review; Obesity -- Complications; Obesity -- Prevention and Control; Bariatric Surgery -- Methods; Cochrane Library; Prepregnancy Care; Reproductive Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We analyzed 2000-2008 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Χ2 Analyses were used to measure differences in maternal and infant characteristics, hospital discharge, outpatient care, and home care among LPT, ET, and term infants. We calculated adjusted risk ratios for the risk of adverse care outcomes among LPT and ET infants compared with term infants. RESULTS: In the adjusted analysis, LPT infants were less likely to be discharged early compared with term infants, whereas there was no difference for ET infants (odds ratio [OR; 95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.65 [0.54-0.79]; 0.95 [0.88-1.02]).

Several neuroactive intermediates are yielded with the degradation of triptophan by this pathway, including the free radical generator 3-hydroxykynurenine, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist quinolinic acid, and the NMDA and -7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist kynurenic acid. The kynurenine pathway may play a role in certain physiological functions such as behaviour, sleep, thermoregulation and pregnancy. Furthermore, the kynurenine pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of cerebral diseases including the AIDS dementia complex, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer, epilepsy, Down syndrome, septicemia-related encephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, malaria, and certain inflammatory brain diseases, as well as in traumatic brain injury.

While multiple factors may contribute to disability in this group, previous studies have not investigated sleep impairments, body perception or mindfulness as potential factors associated with disability post-partum. Objectives To compare women experiencing no pain post-pregnancy with those experiencing pregnancy-related persistent lumbopelvic pain (either low- or high-level disability) across multiple biopsychosocial domains. Design Cross-sectional. Methods Participants completed questionnaires for thorough profiling of factors thought to be important in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain. Specific measures were the Urinary Distress Inventory, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, Back Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophising Scale, The Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Women where categorised into three groups; pain free (n = 26), mild disability (n = 12) and moderate disability (n = 12) (based on Oswestry Disability Index scores). Non-parametric group comparisons were used to compare groups across the profiling variables. Results Differences were identified for kinesiophobia (p = 0.03), body perception (p = 0.02), sleep quantity (p < 0.01) and sleep adequacy (p = 0.02). Generally subjects in the moderate disability group had more negative findings for these variables. Conclusion Disturbances in body-perception, sleep and elevated kinesiophobia were found in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain subjects with moderate disability, factors previously linked to persistent low back pain. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for identification of directional pathways between factors. The results support the consideration of these factors in the assessment and management of pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain.","2016-02","2019-02-14 12:26:31","2019-02-14 12:26:31","","69-75","","","21","","Manual Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Scales; Postnatal Period; Sleep Disorders; Coping Strategies Questionnaire; Disabled; Low Back Pain; Mindfulness; Pelvic Pain; Phobic Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both conditions are known to dysregulate biological pathways responsible for maintaining homeostatic balance and pregnancy health. Depression during pregnancy is associated with poor sleep. Thus, we explored whether disturbed sleep was associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as whether depression augmented the sleep-cytokine relationship, thereby additively contributing to risk for adverse outcomes.Methods: Interview-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine concentrations were evaluated in a cohort of depressed and nondepressed pregnant women (n = 168) at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. Outcomes evaluated included preterm birth, birth weight, and peripartum events.Results: Among depressed women, short sleep duration (<7 hours) was associated with higher interleukin (IL)-8 across time (β = 0.506, p = .001), poor sleep efficiency (<85%) was associated with higher IL-6 (β = 0.205, p = .006), and daytime naps were associated with higher tumor necrosis factor α (β = 0.105, p = .024). Aspects of poor sleep were associated with having a lower weight baby (p values <.053). Among depressed women, interferon-γ increased risk for preterm birth (odds ratio = 1.175, p = .032). Trends for IL-6 and higher birth weight (β = 105.2, p = .085), interferon-γ and lower birth weight (β = -19.92, p < .069), and increased IL-8 and babies weighing less than 4000 grams (odds ratio = 0.72, p < .083) were observed.Conclusions: Although speculative, disturbed sleep may disrupt normal immune processes and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Exploratory analyses indicate that depression modifies these relationships.","2013-09","2019-02-14 12:26:32","2019-02-14 12:26:32","","670-681","","7","75","","Psychosomatic Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Risk Factors; Psychological Tests; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Sleep Disorders -- Epidemiology; Regression; Pregnancy Complications -- Physiopathology; Birth Weight; Childbirth, Premature -- Epidemiology; Depression -- Epidemiology; Sleep Disorders -- Physiopathology; Cytokines -- Metabolism; Depression -- Metabolism; Depression -- Physiopathology; Inflammation -- Metabolism; Pregnancy Complications -- Metabolism; Sleep Disorders -- Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of life. Background. Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. Design. Cross-sectional study design. Methods. Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. Results. The overall caeserean section rate was 70·0% (962/1375), and most of them (59·7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions. Delivery mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. Relevance to clinical practice. Null findings in impact of delivery mode on postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.","2012-06","2019-02-14 12:26:34","2019-02-14 12:26:34","","1534-1543","","11-12","21","","Journal of Clinical Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Cross Sectional Studies; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Coefficient Alpha; Scales; Postnatal Period; Educational Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Factor Analysis; Sex Factors; Multiple Logistic Regression; Home Visits; China; Cesarean Section; Decision Making, Patient; Patient Attitudes -- Evaluation; Postnatal Care; Quality of Life -- China; Quality of Life -- Evaluation; Rural Areas -- China; Sample Size Determination; Structural Equation Modeling; Structured Questionnaires; Vaginal Birth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One key question is whether all infants are equally susceptible to environmental influences, including the intrauterine environment. Reactive temperament has been examined as a plasticity factor, with accumulating evidence suggesting that infants with reactive temperament may be more susceptible to both positive and negative environmental influences. This study examines whether infant reactivity moderates any association between antenatal depression and infant sleep in 2 longitudinal studies: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Generation R cohorts.Methods: Maternal depression scores were assessed during pregnancy using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Infant sleep duration and awakenings, in ALSPAC (N = 8318) and Generation R (N = 2241), were assessed at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Infant reactivity was assessed by temperament questionnaire at 6 months of age.Results: Hierarchical linear regression models indicated a 3-way interaction between reactivity and gender moderating the effect of antenatal depression on infant sleep, on sleep duration in Generation R at 24 months (β = .085, p < .001) in the whole sample and when limited to the Dutch/European group (β = .055, p = .030), and on night awakenings at 18 months in ALSPAC (β = -.085, p = .013). Boys with more reactive temperament exhibited shorter sleep duration and a higher number of awakenings when previously exposed to maternal symptoms of antenatal depression.Conclusion: For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts, that children with temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to antenatal depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant outcomes.","2015-08-07","2019-02-14 12:26:35","2019-02-14 12:26:35","","440-449","","6","36","","Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Infant; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Male; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Sleep -- Physiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Sex Factors; Netherlands; Depression -- Epidemiology; Brief Symptom Inventory; England; Temperament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The medical conditions co-existing with nocturia may share central neural control areas in the brainstem2,3. The aim of this study was to investigate whether improvement in one comorbid variable, in patients with nocturia, may regulate other co-morbid dysfunctions toward a more normal state. Materials and methods: A prospective, two-arm repeated measures study was performed in 2017. Participants were recruited from both Continence and Sleep Medicine Services. Inclusion criteria included: ≥40 years of age; nocturia; either urinary urgency or urge incontinence (UUI) severe enough to require pharmacotherapy or sleep disordered breathing (SDB) requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Exclusion criteria were current urinary tract infection, end-stage renal disease, bladder cancer, previous pelvic radiotherapy, pregnancy, urinary catheterisation and dementia or cognitive impairment that precluded completion of study tasks. Patients not able to complete questionnaires in English were also excluded from the study. Ethics approval: HREC number LNR/17/ MH/96 Baseline data included demographic information, overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), Nocturia-specific quality of life instrument (NQoL), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Euroquol-5D Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D), 2-day bladder diary variables, actigraphy parameters and blood pressure. Study intervention was either an anticholinergic agent or beta-3 agonist (mirabegron) to treat urgency or urgency incontinence or CPAP to reduce apnoea episodes. Those with SDB were not treated for any urinary tract symptoms; UUI patients did not commenced CPAP therapy during the study. Participants were followed up regularly by their clinician as per usual care. Data were re-collected at 12 weeks. Results: Overall, 36 patients participated (20 continence, 16 sleep medicine), 58% female, mean age of 63 years (SD 12) and health status on EQ-5D of 73/100 (SD 17). Full compliance with intervention was 78% for OAB medication and 55% for CPAP worn at least 4 hours at night. Findings are presented in Table 1. As expected, the OABSS was significantly reduced (p=0.04) in the continence cohort while sleep efficiency and sleep disturbance improved in the SDB arm (p<0.001 and 0.020 respectively). In both arms OABSS and sleep parameters changed significantly, while nocturia frequency significantly reduced in the Continence group and approached a significant difference in the sleep cohort (p=0.07). Specific co-morbid dysfunctions improved. In UUI patients sleep parameters improved significant (p=0.03) and high systolic blood pressure fell (p=0.04). In patients with SDB significant improvement was noted in OABSS (p=0.01), sleep domains (total score p=0.04) night urine production (p<0.01) and nocturia-related QoL (p=0.01). A non-significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was noted. Wellbeing measures did not change in either study group. Conclusions: In a cohort of young, relatively healthy individuals, treatment targeted to the presenting dysfunction resulted in less nocturia, improved sleep quality and duration and a reduction in clinically relevant systolic blood pressure (Continence arm only). There were no significant changes in bladder storage, diuresis or nocturnal polyuria index to explain the findings. Treatment appears to have induced change toward a more normal state in non-urinary variables known to have control areas in the brainstem.

However, some infants are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect relatively smaller tongue size. Methods We retrospectively analyzed previously reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm infants ready for discharge (32.6 ± 1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8 ± 9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an index of relative tongue size. Results A smaller airspace around the tongue (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (p < 0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway size (r2 = 0.16, p = 0.11).

Between November 1997 and April 1999, women with singleton pregnancies between gestational ages of 15 and 20 weeks presenting for ultrasound examinations were prospectively queried regarding their usual position of sleep during early gestation. Dominant position of sleep was noted as prone, supine, right side, or left side. At ultrasound examination, placental location was categorized as (1) fundal, (2) left high, (3) right high, (4) anterior high, (5) posterior high, (6) anterior low, (7) posterior low, (8) right low, (9) left low, or (10) central low. During the 18 months of this study, data were obtained from 1,500 patients. At the time of conception, front or prone sleeping was the most common (497 of 1,500, 33.1%), followed by right side (439 of 1,500, 29.3%) and left side (360 of 1,500, 24%), with the back being the least frequent position of sleep (204 of 1,500, 13.6%). Women who usually slept supine at the time of conception and implantation were significantly more likely to have a high or fundal placental location compared with those who usually slept in the prone position (p = 0.041). In addition, women who slept exclusively on their right side early in pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a right-sided placental location compared with women who slept exclusively on their left side (p = 0.025). The data from this investigation indicate that sleeping position early in gestation may influence the ultimate placental implantation site.","2002-01","2019-02-14 12:26:37","2019-02-14 12:26:37","","67-69","","1","167","","Military Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Fisher's Exact Test; Evaluation Research; Academic Medical Centers; Hypothesis; Mississippi; Posture; Reproduction -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Metrics characterizing the sleep state distribution within a trace were also considered for inclusion into an IUGR detection model.Results: Significant differences in the risk markers comparing growth-restricted with healthy fetuses were found. When used in a logistic regression classifier, their performance for identifying IUGR was considerably superior before 34 weeks of gestation. Long-term variability in active sleep was superior to short-term variability [area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 72% compared with 71%]. Most predictive was the number of minutes in high variation per hour (AUC of 75%). A multivariate IUGR prediction model improved the AUC to 76%.Conclusion: We suggest that heart rate variability markers together with surrogate information on sleep states can contribute to the detection of early-onset IUGR.","2017-09","2019-02-14 12:26:38","2019-02-14 12:26:38","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","9","96","","Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Pregnancy; Male; Gestational Age; Risk Assessment; Cardiotocography; Fetal Growth Retardation; Heart Rate, Fetal; Impact of Events Scale; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; Ultrasonography, Prenatal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extant documents on traditional Persian medicine refer to many plants which could induce sleep and which were used by pregnant women. In Iran, local herbal shops continue to provide these herbs to pregnant women to treat insomnia. One such herb is Lactuca sativa L. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lettuce seed on pregnant women for the treatment of insomnia. Methods and materials In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 100 pregnant women with insomnia aged 20–45 years were assigned to receive capsules containing 1000 mg of lettuce seed or a placebo daily for two weeks. The main outcome was the quality of sleep, which was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results Each group contained 50 participants. An improvement in the PSQI score was significantly greater in patients receiving lettuce seed than those receiving the placebo. Linear regression analysis showed that, after controlling for the other variables, the average sleep score of the experimental group was significantly lower than for the placebo group (p = 0.03). Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that lettuce seed decreased insomnia during pregnancy and could be recommended as a safe natural remedy for treatment of pregnancy-related insomnia.

Episodes consist of anxious dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion). DESIGN: Three-group design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures. SETTING: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by telephone. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum: n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 +/- 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas); pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 +/- 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age = 28.5 +/- 6.34 years). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects completed questionnaires about pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares, associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%). Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P < 0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%) as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%) (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of dream-associated behaviors. CONCLUSION: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.","2007-09","2019-02-14 12:26:39","2019-02-14 12:26:39","","1162-1169","","9","30","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Health Behavior; Prevalence; Depression, Postpartum -- Psychosocial Factors; Maternal Behavior; Postnatal Period -- Psychosocial Factors; Dreams; Night Terrors -- Psychosocial Factors; Quebec","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting and subjects. A total of 1765 women were invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11-16 weeks of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use. Main outcome measures. Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors, smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic medicine. Results. Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%). Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p < 0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with multiparity. Conclusions. Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting.","2014-09","2019-02-14 12:26:40","2019-02-14 12:26:40","","139-145","","3","32","","Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Socioeconomic Factors; Dietary Supplements; Drugs, Prescription -- In Pregnancy -- Iceland; Homeopathy; Iceland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce these effects, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas sleep under insecticide-treated bednets, are treated for malaria illness and anaemia, and receive chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial drug during the second and third trimesters. To assess the effects of malaria chemoprevention given to pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas on substantive maternal and infant health outcomes. We also summarised the effects of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone, and preventive regimens for Plasmodium vivax. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists up to 1 June 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any antimalarial drug regimen for preventing malaria in pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas compared to placebo or no intervention. In the mother, we sought outcomes that included mortality, severe anaemia, and severe malaria; anaemia, haemoglobin values, and malaria episodes; indicators of malaria infection, and adverse events. In the baby, we sought foetal loss, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality; preterm birth and birthweight measures; and indicators of malaria infection. We included regimens that were known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time but may no longer be used because of parasite drug resistance. Two review authors applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD); both are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Seventeen trials enrolling 14,481 pregnant women met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and Thailand (two trials). Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo or no intervention; chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), and mefloquine (weekly), or intermittent preventive therapy with SP (given twice, three times or monthly). Trials recruited women in their first or second pregnancy (eight trials); only multigravid women (one trial); or all women (eight trials). Only six trials had adequate allocation concealment.For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate to severe anaemia by around 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, high quality evidence), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials,, 3662 participants, high quality evidence). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by around 61% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; seven trials, 3663 participants, high quality evidence), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (low quality evidence). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (very low quality evidence).For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (MD 92.72 g, 95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, moderate quality evidence), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; eight trials, 3619 participants, moderate quality evidence), and reduces placental parasitaemia by around 46% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69; seven trials, 2830 participants, high quality evidence). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses were underpowered to detect clinically important differences.In multigravid women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; three trials, 977 participants, high quality evidence)but there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes.In trials giving chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia (defined by authors, but at least < 8 g/L: RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two trials, 1327 participants, low quality evidence), but consistent benefits have not been shown for other outcomes.In an analysis confined only to intermittent preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the evidence were similar.A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis against P. vivax showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20; one trial, 942 participants). Routine chemoprevention to prevent malaria and its consequences has been extensively tested in RCTs, with clinically important benefits on anaemia and parasitaemia in the mother, and on birthweight in infants.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]","2014-10","2019-02-14 12:26:40","2019-02-14 12:26:40","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","10","","","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Infant, Newborn; Relative Risk; Clinical Trials; Confidence Intervals; Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic -- Prevention and Control; Birth Weight; Parity; Meta Analysis; Anemia -- Prevention and Control -- In Pregnancy; Antimalarials -- Therapeutic Use -- In Pregnancy; Chemoprevention -- In Pregnancy; Infant Mortality; Malaria -- Prevention and Control -- In Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic -- Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mothers can be with their infants only during scheduled visiting times in the nursery. However, some health professionals propose that infants are at increased physiological and developmental risk if on-cue self-regulatory access to their mothers is not provided. Kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care may be nurturing for medically stable, lower-risk preterm infants because it supports their efforts toward self-regulation and competent functioning (Anderson, 1999). This randomized controlled trial was done to test the hypotheses that infants given kangaroo care (KC) would have higher tympanic core temperature, less weight loss, more optimal behavioral state, and lower acuity.Thirty-four healthy preterm infants and their mothers were selected from Chung Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Maternal inclusion criteria were no pre-existing medical problems, willingness to breastfeed, and no problems that would keep the mother from the nursery. Infant inclusion criteria were 34-36 completed weeks gestation, 5-minute Apgar score <=7, stable respirations, and admission to the normal newborn or observation nursery.Eligible dyads were recruited after birth (Day 0). On Day 1 they were randomly assigned by minimization just before the first study feeding to the control (n = 17) or KC group (n = 17). Stratification variables were gender, birth weight, delivery method, and parity. On Days 1 and 2, control infants wore a shirt and diaper, were wrapped in a blanket, and held by their mothers for one hour, three times a day at scheduled feeding times; KC infants wore a diaper and were held upright skin-to-skin on their mothers' chest except during breastfeeding.Hypothesis testing was done using repeated measures analysis of variance and independent sample t-tests. KC infants compared to control infants had higher mean tympanic temperature (37.3 degrees]C vs. 37.0 degrees]C), more quiet sleep (62% vs. 22%), more inactive awake behavior (14% vs. 7%), less drowsiness (2% vs. 15%), and less crying (2% vs. 6%) all at p = .000. No significant difference was found for weight loss and acuity (length of hospital stay).These findings can be used for evidence-based nursing practice in Taiwan. This is the first randomized controlled trial to provide information about the effect of early KC on tympanic temperature, weight loss, behavioral state, and acuity for 34-36 week gestation preterm infants in Taiwan. KC as given in this study is a safe intervention.","1999-01","2019-02-14 12:26:41","2019-02-14 12:26:41","","","135 p","","","","","","","","","","Case Western Reserve University (Health Sciences)","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI9960926","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Human; Body Weight; Descriptive Statistics; T-Tests; Taiwan; Clinical Trials; Random Assignment; Gestational Age; Analysis of Variance; Mothers; Repeated Measures; Infant, Premature; Infant Behavior; Apgar Score; Kangaroo Care; Length of Stay; Weight Loss; Hospitals; Infant Physiology; Inpatients; Nurseries, Hospital; Tympanic Body Temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated whether children born at early term (37-38 6/7 weeks' gestation) are at an increased risk for childhood OSA as compared with those born later.Methods: In this population-based cohort analysis all singleton deliveries occurring between 1991-2013 at a single regional tertiary medical centre were included. Gestational age upon delivery was sub-divided into: early preterm (<33 6/7 weeks' gestation), late preterm (34-36 6/7), early term, full term (39-40 6/7), late term (41-41 6/7), and post term (>42 0/7). Incidence of OSA related hospitalizations of the offspring, up to the age of 18 years, was evaluated. A survival curve and a Cox model were used to assess the association.Results: During the study period 240 953 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. OSA hospitalization (n = 1320) rates decreased as gestational age increased from 1.1% in the early preterm group, 0.8% in late preterm, 0.7% at early term, 0.5% in full term, 0.4% in late term, to 0.3% in post term born children. In the Cox regression, early term delivery exhibited an increased risk for paediatric OSA (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.3 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.5) while late and post term deliveries were associated with significantly lower OSA risk when compared with full term (HR 0.8 95% CI 0.6, 0.9 and HR 0.6 95% CI 0.4, 0.8, respectively).Conclusions: Early term deliveries are associated with higher rates of paediatric OSA, which decrease gradually as gestational age advances.","2017-03","2019-02-14 12:26:42","2019-02-14 12:26:42","","149-156","","2","31","","Paediatric & Perinatal Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Child; Adolescence; Human; Male; Risk Factors; Gestational Age; Analysis of Variance; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Israel; Child, Preschool; Childbirth, Premature; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Epidemiology; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Etiology; Hospitalization -- Statistics and Numerical Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Explanations for this disparity include a two-fold greater prevalence of prone (i.e., stomach) infant sleep placement among black caregivers. I test the hypothesis that the contraction of state economies may contribute to this disparity by increasing the risk of prone infant sleep placement among black mothers.Methods: I retrieved data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment series and 33,518 black mothers in 26 states participating in the 1996-2002 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. I use weighted multivariable analyses to control for individual characteristics and state and time trends.Results: Black mothers exhibit an elevated risk of reporting prone placement one month following statewide declines in employment (adjusted odds ratio for a one percent decline = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22). This risk remains elevated after control for individual variables. In contrast, I find no association between the economy and prone placement among white mothers.Conclusions: Statewide economic decline may reduce adherence to the recommended non-prone infant sleep position among black, but not white, mothers. Additional research among black caregivers should determine which mechanisms connect economic downturns to prone infant sleep placement.","2008-09","2019-02-14 12:26:43","2019-02-14 12:26:43","","678-681","","9","18","","Annals of Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Sleep; Logistic Regression; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Human; Health Behavior; Funding Source; Male; Prevalence; Employment; Confidence Intervals; Mothers; Blacks; Prone Position; Multivariate Analysis; Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was a randomized crossover trial, comparing intervention (0.5-1.0 micro T above ambient levels) with ambient magnetic field levels, during two 5-night measurement periods. Subjects lived in the Seattle, Washington, area and were 20-40 years of age, had regular menstrual cycles, were not taking oral contraceptives, and had not breastfed or been pregnant during the previous year. The study was conducted between March and September of 2001. Sleep outcomes were measured via actigraphy. The range of magnetic field exposure was 0.001-0.50 micro T during the ambient period and 0.41-1.21 micro T during the intervention period. Sleep outcomes were not significantly different between the intervention and the ambient measurement periods. The intervention magnetic field had no effect on sleep patterns, suggesting that this exposure may not be an important factor in predicting sleep of young women who sleep at home.","2004-08","2019-02-14 12:26:45","2019-02-14 12:26:45","","224-229","","3","160","","American Journal of Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Polysomnography; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Time Factors; Sleep -- Physiology; Clinical Trials; Random Assignment; Massachusetts; Washington; Circadian Rhythm; Crossover Design; Data Analysis, Statistical; Electromagnetic Fields; Environmental Exposure; Premenopause","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the etiology and consequences of CIH are extensively investigated in the adult, the developmental ramifications of this disease process are unknown. Design: This study was done to investigate the effect of CIH during gestation on offspring development. Pregnant female Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to daily CIH throughout the gestational period. Results: Postnatal day-1 offspring from CIH mothers were asymmetrically growth restricted, with decreased body weights and elevated brain-weight:liver-weight ratios. Furthermore, CIH newborns had elevated heart- and brain-weight:body weight ratios, and decreased liver-weight:body weight ratios. By adulthood, body weights of growth restricted offspring were significantly greater, as were the liver-weight:body weight ratios. CIH offspring also had greater body fat deposition, were hyperglycemic and had elevated plasma levels of insulin during development into adults. Conclusion: These data suggest that alteration of the maternal intrauterine environment by gestational CIH effects the long-term development of the offspring and increases the risk of the offspring to metabolic diseases in adulthood.","2013-12","2019-02-14 12:26:46","2019-02-14 12:26:46","","564.e1-9","","6","209","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Male; Analysis of Variance; Pregnancy Complications -- Physiopathology; Body Weights and Measures; Fetal Growth Retardation -- Etiology; Models, Biological; Animal Population Groups; Animals; Anoxia -- Complications; Anoxia -- Physiopathology; Blood Glucose -- Analysis; Body Weight -- Physiology; Fetal Growth Retardation -- Physiopathology; Insulin -- Blood; Rats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the last decade, however, similar problems have increasingly been documented in normal infants born at term gestation, with recommendations of supine sleeping for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome often implicated as a causal factor. This article seeks to inform and educate neonatal and pediatric nurses on positional and postural influences in normal and delayed infant development, including the relationship of sleep and play positions to developmental issues. An observant nurse who understands normal development, can recognize atypical postures, and is knowledgeable about potential developmental consequences is in a position to intervene at the earliest interaction with the family. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) sleep position guidelines, however, must not be compromised in the process. Current AAP rationale and guidelines for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome are summarized to facilitate nursing efforts to correctly model and teach infant caregivers. Common-sense suggestions for hospital and community-based nurses to help parents avoid preventable developmental delay while reinforcing current sleep position guidelines are presented.

It is well documented that exercise improves psychological well-being in nonpregnant subjects with symptoms of depression. However, in only a few small studies have researchers examined the effect of exercise on symptoms of depression among pregnant women. We hypothesize that physiotherapist-supervised group exercise for pregnant women at risk of antenatal depression increases their psychological well-being. This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a supervised group exercise intervention for pregnant women with a current or previous history of depression and/or anxiety.Methods/design: The RCT is being carried out at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, in the period 2016-2019. The inclusion criteria are pregnant women ≥18 years of age with depression and/or anxiety requiring treatment by a psychiatrist or a psychologist within the last 10 years and/or intake of antidepressants in the 3 months prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The women must have appropriate Danish language skills, be pregnant with a single fetus, give written informed consent, and be at 17-22 gestational weeks when the intervention begins. The primary outcome is psychological well-being (the five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), functional ability (General Health Questionnaire), clinical symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), sleep quality and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and pregnancy and delivery outcomes. The intervention is supervised group exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. The control group will receive standard antenatal care. On the basis of sample size calculation, a total of 300 women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a ratio of 1:1.Discussion: The trial is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge used in planning antenatal care for pregnant women at risk of depression.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02833519 .

Pregnancy at higher altitudes has distinctive physiologic attributes that affect perinatal outcomes and have been correlated with the duration and intensity of altitude. The effect of altitude on adult sleep has been studied at various elevations and has unique characteristics that may impact pregnant women. The effect of altitude on sleep during pregnancy is mostly unknown.This dissertation research explored late pregnancy sleep quantity and quality characteristics at moderate altitude by comparing them to a similar sample at sea level, describing associations between moderate altitude sleep parameters and length of labor by self-report and medical records, and testing associations between sleep and pregnancy outcomes (length of labor and mode of delivery) at moderate altitude. Participants were nulliparous third trimester women (n=50) recruited in Flagstaff, Arizona (elevation 6910 feet [2106 meters]). A 3-day sleep diary and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were completed between 35 gestational weeks and one week prior to delivery. Descriptive statistics, unpaired t-tests, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, ANCOVA, multiple regression, and logistic regression were utilized.Results showed that after controlling for education, compared to nulliparous women at sea level, women at moderate altitude reported significantly higher sleep disturbance scores. After controlling for infant birth weight, length of labor was associated with the PSQI self-report measure for sleep onset latency. Together, infant birth weight, maternal weight, age, income, and sleep onset latency, hours of sleep, sleep disturbance, and sleep quality accounted for 51.6% of the variance in length of labor. Mode of delivery was also associated with sleep disturbance.","2012-01","2019-02-14 12:26:58","2019-02-14 12:26:58","","","122 p","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Francisco","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3541864","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Human; Sleep Disorders -- Etiology; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Analysis of Covariance; Comparative Studies; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Socioeconomic Factors; Diaries; Birth Weight; Multiple Regression; Pregnancy Outcomes -- Evaluation; Sleep Disorders -- Complications; Altitude -- Adverse Effects; Arizona; Delivery, Obstetric -- Evaluation; Labor -- Evaluation; Nulliparas; Unpaired T-Tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of the abuse was 'submerged' until her mid-thirties, when she was pregnant with her second child, and finally began to remember and deal with the realities of what had happened to her. During her second pregnancy, Anna wrote, 'It has taken me more than three years to even begin to deal with the rage I feel about my first birth experience, even though I have been in therapy most of that time. Now that I am pregnant again, the unresolved issues are coming to the surface, and intense fears that this birth will be a repeat of the first.' Anna's first child, Elliot, was born in 1987 in a hospital birthing room in the northeastern United States. Her husband Paul, a younger sister, and a close friend were present, and she was attended by an obstetrician named Bernie. She describes that birth as '19 hours of hard labor, absolutely exhausting and unmanageable, which required drugs at some point to let me sleep for a few hours.' Labor was induced by Pitocin due to premature rupture of membranes and lack of effective contractions after 12 hours. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was used throughout labor. Anna breastfed Elliot for three years, and found La Leche League 'extremely helpful and supportive' during that time. Tom, Anna's second child, was born at home in 1991. Two midwives attended the birth after she changed caregivers during the pregnancy because she 'did not feel safe enough' with the obstetrician and nurse-midwife team she had chosen for this birth. She maintained the team as backup, although they did not know of her plans for a home birth. Her second labor lasted under 6 hours, was noninterventive, and 'incredibly intense and painful, partly due to the abuse memories that were coming up and getting in the way and partly due to the baby's position.' We thank Anna Rose for sharing her story with Birth. Her reason for doing so is, in her words, because, 'I feel strongly that it is important to share this information in an effort to educate health care professionals so that other women may be helped.'","1992-12","2019-02-14 12:26:59","2019-02-14 12:26:59","","214-218","","4","19","","Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Childbirth -- Psychosocial Factors; Pregnancy -- Psychosocial Factors; Child Abuse, Sexual -- Psychosocial Factors; Labor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parent outcomes examined included competence, and confidence; baby outcomes included infant behaviours of crying, settling, and sleeping problems and parent-infant relationship outcomes included parental responsiveness. Systematic searches of five databases were carried out. In total, 36 randomised controlled trials over the past 35 years were included in the meta-analyses, with a total of 4880 participants. Interventions were carried out either during pregnancy or within the first 12 months after birth and involved teaching specific strategies and provision of information on infant development and behaviour. Mean effect sizes were obtained using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was found on parent responsiveness and infant sleep. Potential moderator variables were assessed for these two outcomes using the SEM approach. Results showed that early parenting interventions are effective in improving parental responsiveness ( d = 0.77), and improving or preventing infant sleep problems ( d = 0.24), but not crying problems ( d = 0.27) possibly due to low power. No conclusions could be drawn in regards to parental competence or confidence. Moderator analysis showed that for interventions aimed at improving responsiveness, briefer interventions were more effective than longer ones; and studies published more recently reported smaller effects than older studies. No other moderators influenced the assessed intervention outcomes. The findings of this study provide further evidence for the positive effects of early parenting interventions for infants under 12 months of age, however future research is needed to assess intervention effects on parental competence and confidence.","2017-06","2019-02-14 12:27:00","2019-02-14 12:27:00","","1507-1526","","6","26","","Journal of Child & Family Studies","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Infant; Human; Systematic Review; Infant Development; Infant Behavior; Meta Analysis; Parenting; Confidence; Parent-Infant Relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experimental animal studies have shown that melatonin therapy has neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in the IUGR fetus. Consequently, clinical trials are currently underway to assess the short and long term effects of antenatal melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies. Given melatonin's role in sleep regulation, this hormone could affect the developing infants' sleep-wake cycle and cardiovascular function after birth. In this review, we will 1) examine the role of melatonin as a therapy for IUGR pregnancies and the potential implications on sleep and the cardiovascular system; 2) examine the development of sleep-wake cycle in fetal and neonatal life; 3) discuss the development of cardiovascular control during sleep; 4) discuss the effect of IUGR on sleep and the cardiovascular system and 5) discuss the future implications of melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies.","2016-04","2019-02-14 12:27:00","2019-02-14 12:27:00","","64-73","","","26","","Sleep Medicine Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Infant; Infant, Newborn; Child Development; Childbirth, Premature; Infant, Premature; Sleep -- Drug Effects; Fetal Growth Retardation -- Physiopathology; Antioxidants -- Therapeutic Use; Cardiovascular System -- Drug Effects; Fetal Growth Retardation -- Drug Therapy; Melatonin -- Pharmacodynamics; Melatonin -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between maternal OSA and altered fetal growth after adjusting for potential covariates.Results: There were 48 women without and 31 women with OSA. There were no differences in the proportion of infants with birth weight <10th centile between women with and without OSA (23 vs. 25%, p = 1.0), However, the presence of maternal OSA was predictive of impaired fetal growth (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.6).

DESIGN: Healthy term infants (13 born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy) were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) two to three weeks after birth, (b) two to three months after birth, and (c) five to six months after birth. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold in response to air jet stimulation were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. RESULTS: Maternal smoking significantly elevated arousal threshold in QS when infants slept supine at 2-3 months of age (p<0.05). Infants of smoking mothers also had fewer spontaneous arousals from QS at 2-3 months in both prone (p<0.05) and supine (p<0.001) sleeping positions.

CONCLUSIONS: Maternal tobacco smoking significantly impairs both stimulus induced and spontaneous arousal from QS when infants sleep in the supine position, at the age when the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome is highest.","2002-09","2019-02-14 12:27:02","2019-02-14 12:27:02","","F100-5","","2","87","","Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Fetal & Neonatal Edition","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Questionnaires; Infant; Human; Age Factors; Polysomnography; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Descriptive Statistics; Comparative Studies; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Supine Position -- In Infancy and Childhood; Arousal -- In Infancy and Childhood; Passive Smoking -- In Infancy and Childhood; Prone Position -- In Infancy and Childhood; Research Subject Recruitment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014. Pregnant women who were attending maternity yoga classes at Palmore Hospital between 20 and 23 weeks’ gestation were enrolled as the yoga group, and a matched control group was also enrolled. Study participants completed questionnaires, including a perceived stress scale and sleep logs, during their second and third trimesters. Heart rate variability and salivary α‐amylase levels were evaluated as stress indices at 20–23 weeks’ gestation, 28–31 weeks’ gestation and 36–40 weeks’ gestation. Results: A total of 38 women were in the yoga group, with 53 in the control group. At 28–31 weeks’ gestation, heart rate variability during night and late‐night periods was significantly higher in the yoga group than in the control group. At 36–40 weeks’ gestation, variability between the morning, afternoon and late night was significantly higher in the yoga group. Salivary α‐amylase levels decreased significantly immediately after practicing yoga during all evaluation periods in the yoga group. Night‐time sleep duration was significantly longer in the yoga group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that practicing yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system during the third trimester of pregnancy, consolidating sleep during the night and decreasing α‐amylase levels, which indicates reduced stress.","2018-10","2019-02-14 12:27:03","2019-02-14 12:27:03","","1887-1895","","10","44","","Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology Research","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Human; Expectant Mothers; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Scales; Time Factors; Gestational Age; Amylases -- Blood; Autonomic Nervous System -- In Pregnancy; Heart Rate Variability; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Stress, Psychological -- Prevention and Control; Yoga -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Fifteen healthy, nulliparous women in their second or third trimesters with singleton pregnancies attended weekly mindfulness meditation and prenatal Hatha yoga classes in the community for 7 weeks. Sleep variables, as estimated by 72 hr of continuous wrist actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), were recorded at baseline (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2). Control data were obtained by evaluating sleep in the third-trimester group at Time 1. Due to small sample size, data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: Women who began the intervention in the second trimester had significantly fewer awakenings, less wake time during the night, and less perceived sleep disturbance at Time 2 than at baseline. Those who began during the third trimester had poorer sleep over time in spite of the intervention. Women who began the intervention in their second trimester had less awake time at Time 2 compared to third-trimester controls at Time 1. CONCLUSIONS: Mindful yoga shows promise for women in their second trimester of pregnancy to diminish total number of awakenings at night and improve sleep efficiency and merits further exploration. Results from this pilot study provide the data to estimate sample size and design and implement powered and more controlled studies in the future.","2010-04","2019-02-14 12:27:03","2019-02-14 12:27:03","","363-370","","4","11","","Biological Research for Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","California; Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Physical Activity; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Effect Size; Scales; Self Report; Time Factors; Confidence Intervals; Control Group; Mann-Whitney U Test; Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimesters; Pilot Studies; Yoga -- In Pregnancy; Experimental Studies; Meditation -- In Pregnancy; Nonparametric Statistics; Parametric Statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PSQI and State-Anxiety Inventory were used to assess outcomes. ANCOVA analyses were used with the pretest scores as covariates and showed significant improvement in sleep quality, stress, and anxiety in the music listening group compared with the control group. The most frequently used music genre by participants in the experimental group was lullabies, followed by classical music and crystal baby music. This study supported the theory that 2-week music listening interventions may reduce stress, anxiety, and yield better sleep quality for sleep-disturbed pregnant women. The analysis of participants’ journals also implied that the expectant mothers’ choices of musical genres may correlate more with perceived prenatal benefits or the desire to interact with their unborn child.","2016-04","2019-02-14 12:27:04","2019-02-14 12:27:04","","296-311","","3","56","","Women & Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Analysis of Covariance; Psychological Tests; Taiwan; Random Assignment; Randomized Controlled Trials; Music Therapy; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Experimental Studies; Anxiety -- Prevention and Control -- In Pregnancy; Dyssomnias -- In Pregnancy -- Taiwan; Stress -- Prevention and Control -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A case-control study was carried out in which household survey data were collected from 817 MHO member households, 787 non-member households in MHO catchment areas, and 676 control households in areas without MHOs. We compiled MHO register data by household for a 22-month period. Outcome measures included utilization of priority services, health expenditures and out-of-pocket payments. Independent variables included individual, household and community demographic, socioeconomic and access characteristics, as determined through a household survey in 2004.Findings: MHO members who were up to date on premium payments (controlling for education, distance to the nearest health facility and other factors) were 1.7 times more likely to get treated for fevers in modern facilities; three times more likely to take children with diarrhoea to a health facility and/or treat them with oral rehydration salts at home; twice as likely to make four or more prenatal visits; and twice as likely, if pregnant or younger than 5 years, to sleep under an insecticide-treated net (P<0.10 or better in all cases). However, distance was also a significant negative predictor for the utilization of many services, particularly assisted deliveries. Household and individual enrolment in an MHO were not significantly associated with socioeconomic status (with the exception of the highest quintile), and MHOs seemed to provide some financial protection for their members.Conclusion: MHOs are one mechanism that countries strengthening the supply of primary care can use to increase financial access to -- and equity in -- priority health services.

The aim of this study, designed to overcome methodologic limitations of previous research, was to investigate the effects of prenatal cocaine use on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, a marker of central nervous system development. METHODS: In a longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine/crack exposure, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester about cocaine, crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. Two-hour paper- and computer-generated EEG sleep recordings were obtained on a sample of the full-term infants on the second day of life and at 1 year postpartum. Eligible newborns were full-term, had received no general anesthesia, and had a 5-minute Apgar score >5. All infants whose mothers used one or more lines of cocaine during their first trimester or any crack (n = 37) were selected. A comparison group was chosen randomly from the group of women who did not use cocaine or crack during their pregnancy (n = 34). RESULTS: Women who used cocaine/crack during the first trimester were older, less educated, less likely to be working, and used more tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs than women who did not use cocaine/crack during the first trimester. There were no differences in infant birth weight, length, head circumference, or gestational age between the two exposure groups. After controlling for the significant covariates, prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with less well developed spectral correlations between homologous brain regions at birth, and with lower spectral EEG power values at 1 year of age. Prenatal alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use were found to affect state regulation and cortical activities. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use can be detected with quantitative EEG measures.","2000-01","2019-02-14 12:27:05","2019-02-14 12:27:05","","39-48","","1","105","","Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Infant; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Purposive Sample; Substance Abuse, Perinatal; Data Analysis, Statistical; Biophysiological Methods; Electroencephalography -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine a better position for ventilated preterm infants, this study was done: (1) to compare the effect of supine and prone position on factors which impact energy conservation, including motor activity, behavioral state, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and heart rate (HR); and (2) to examine relationships among these variables.Twenty-eight premature infants undergoing intermittent mandatory ventilation were included. Inclusion criteria were: <36 weeks gestation, <seven days postnatal age, no sedation or congenital abnormalities, and parental consent.A two-period crossover was used. Each infant was randomly assigned to position sequence: supine/prone or prone/supine. Infants were placed supine for two hours and prone for two hours. During the study protocol, care procedures were minimized and ventilator weaning did not occur.Most hypotheses were supported. When infants were prone, compared to supine, they had (a) less motor activity (1.11 vs. 2.16, p < .001), (b) less crying (6% vs. 12%, p < .05), less active sleep (24% vs. 43%, p < .001), and more quiet sleep (68% vs. 40%, p < .001), (c) less signs of behavioral stress (8.9 vs. 27.3, p < .001), (d) higher SpO2 (96.5% vs. 95.7%, p < .01) and (e) fewer oxygen desaturation event, defined as SpO2 <90% and >=20 seconds (.86 vs. 4.47, p < .01). No significant differences were found in HR and frequencies of tachycardia and bradycardia. Motor activity was positively related to HR (r = .3) but negatively related to SpO2 (r = -.2); active sleep, active awake, and crying were associated with higher HR and lower SpO2. However, without severe oxygen desaturation, SpO 2 was not associated with HR.These findings suggest that prone position may reduce oxygen desaturation and assist energy conservation for ventilated preterm infants. Improved energy conservation, in turn, may enhance infant adaptation to extrauterine life and facilitate ventilator weaning.","2000-01","2019-02-14 12:27:06","2019-02-14 12:27:06","","","162 p","","","","","","","","","","Case Western Reserve University (Health Sciences)","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI9967623","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Sleep; Human; Infant, Newborn; Comparative Studies; Random Assignment; Crying; Infant, Premature; Infant Behavior; Heart Rate; Inpatients; Crossover Design; Supine Position -- In Infancy and Childhood; Prone Position -- In Infancy and Childhood; Biophysiological Methods; Adaptation, Physiological; Energy Metabolism; Motor Activity; Oxygen Saturation; Respiration, Artificial -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adequate positioning strategies may play an important role in protecting infants from environmental stressor and assisting quality of sleep. However, no study has examined effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch responses for ventilated preterm infants during the critical first week postbirth. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to compare effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress responses in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. DESIGN/METHODS: The infants were aged 25-36 weeks of gestation, < or = 7 days of age, and without sedation or congenital abnormalities. Using a crossover design, 28 infants were randomly assigned to supine/prone or prone/supine position sequence. Infants were placed in each position for 2 hours. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. Behavioural state and frequencies of stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch were systemically recorded and analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance. FINDINGS: Infants when prone compared with supine had (a) less crying, less active sleep, and more quiet sleep states, and (b) fewer stress responses of startle, tremor, and twitch. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that prone positioning improves the quality of sleep and decreases stress for ventilated preterm infants during the first week postbirth. These may conserve energy and assist infants' extrauterine adaptation.","2002-10-15","2019-02-14 12:27:06","2019-02-14 12:27:06","","161-169","","2","40","","Journal of Advanced Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Behavior Rating Scales; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Male; Descriptive Statistics; Power Analysis; Taiwan; Random Assignment; Analysis of Variance; Repeated Measures; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Mann-Whitney U Test; Infant, Premature; Infant Behavior; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test; Observational Methods; Inpatients; Crossover Design; Supine Position -- In Infancy and Childhood; Prone Position -- In Infancy and Childhood; Clinical Nursing Research; Infant Behavior -- Evaluation; Stress, Physiological -- In Infancy and Childhood; Ventilator Patients -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intervention was a gentle, 8-week Iyengar yoga program. Core outcomes assessed pre- and post-treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Scale [IRLS] and RLS ordinal scale), sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Participants also completed yoga logs and a brief exit questionnaire regarding their experience with the study. Results: Ten (10) women, aged 32-66 years, completed the study. Participants attended an average 13.4±0.5 (of 16 possible) classes, and completed a mean of 4.1±0.3 (of 5 possible) homework sessions/week. At follow-up, participants demonstrated striking reductions in RLS symptoms and symptom severity, with symptoms decreasing to minimal/mild in all but 1 woman and no participant scoring in the severe range by week 8. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large: 1.6 for IRLS total, and 2.2 for RLS ordinal scale. IRLS scores declined significantly with increasing minutes of homework practice per session ( r=0.70, p=0.025) and total homework minutes ( r=0.64, p<0.05), suggesting a possible dose-response relation. Participants also showed significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood (all p's≤0.02), with effect sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that yoga may be effective in attenuating RLS symptoms and symptom severity, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep and mood in women with RLS.","2013-06","2019-02-14 12:27:09","2019-02-14 12:27:09","","527-535","","6","19","","Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Adult; Human; Treatment Outcomes; Funding Source; Middle Age; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Effect Size; Psychological Tests; Scales; T-Tests; Paired T-Tests; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Repeated Measures; Alternative Therapies; Intervention Trials; Mann-Whitney U Test; Multivariate Analysis; Pilot Studies; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test; Training Effect (Physiology); Restless Legs -- Therapy; Therapeutic Exercise -- Methods; Exercise Physiology; Pretest-Posttest Design; Yoga","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, new evidence suggests that short- and long-term neonatal morbidity is also associated. This includes respiratory morbidity with conflicting results. To determine whether mode of delivery has an impact on the long-term risk for respiratory morbidity in the offspring, a population-based cohort analysis was conducted including all singleton term deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single tertiary medical center. A comparison was performed between children delivered via elective cesarean delivery (CD) and those delivered vaginally. Multiple gestations and fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded from the analysis as were all cases of urgent CDs. Pediatric hospitalizations involving respiratory morbidity of offspring up to the age of 18 years were evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity incidence and a Cox regression model to control for confounders. During the study period, 132,054 term deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 8.9% were via elective CDs (n = 11,746) and 91.1% (n = 120,308) were vaginal deliveries. Hospitalizations of the offspring involving respiratory morbidity were significantly more common in offspring delivered by CDs (5.2 vs. 4.3% in vaginal deliveries, p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of respiratory morbidity in the elective CD group (log rank p < 0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model, while controlling for maternal age, gestational age, and birthweight, CD exhibited a significant and independent association with long-term respiratory morbidity of the offspring (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.22 (CI, 1.12-1.33), p < 0.001).Conclusion: Elective cesarean delivery at term is a significant risk factor for long-term pediatric respiratory morbidity of the offspring. What is Known: • Cesarean delivery is a major surgery with known possible complications. • Cesarean delivery has possible immediate complications for the newborn including respiratory complications. What is New: • Our study shows more long term respiratory morbidity in the CD group including asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. • Different possible explanations have been proposed including exposure to maternal flora during vaginal delivery and the stress hormones secreted during contractions and delivery.","2018-11","2019-02-14 12:27:10","2019-02-14 12:27:10","","1653-1659","","11","177","","European Journal of Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Infant, Newborn; Male; Risk Factors; Delivery, Obstetric; Retrospective Design; Incidence; Kaplan-Meier Estimator; Impact of Events Scale; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; Hospitalization -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Cesarean Section -- Adverse Effects; Morbidity; Respiratory Tract Diseases -- Epidemiology; Respiratory Tract Diseases -- Etiology; Term Birth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pregnancy-related hormonal and metabolic changes and RLS symptomatology. Design: Blood measurements and overnight polysomnography were performed during the third trimester of pregnancy and again 3 months after delivery. We investigated blood hormonal levels (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], iron, ferritin, hemoglobin) and polysomnographic sleep parameters. Subjective sleep quality and RLS symptoms were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the International RLS study group (IRLSSG) rating scale. Setting: Sleep laboratory. Participants: Ten pregnant women fulfilling the IRLSSG criteria for RLS diagnosis and 9 pregnant healthy controls underwent the protocol. Interventions: N/A. Results: Women with RLS showed higher levels of estradiol during pregnancy compared to controls (34,211 ± 6,397 pg/mL vs. 25,475 ± 7,990 pg/mL, P< 0.05). Patients also showed more periodic limb movements (PLMs) before and after delivery, particularly during sleep stage 1 and wakefulness (P < 0.05). PLMs decreased postpartum in subjects with RLS only (P < 0.05); sleep efficiency increased in women without RLS and remained unchanged in patients (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups before or after delivery in plasma concentrations of prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, iron, ferritin or hemoglobin. Conclusions: RLS in pregnant women goes along with transiently increased estradiol levels and PLM indices suggesting that estrogens play a pathophysiological role for triggering RLS symptoms during pregnancy.

Elevation of the upper body increases upper airway cross-sectional area (CSA) and improves severity of OSA in a subgroup of nonpregnant patients (positional-dependent sleep apnea). We tested the hypothesis that elevated position of the upper body improves OSA early after delivery.Methods: Following institutional review board approval, we conducted a randomized, crossover study on two postpartum units of Massachusetts General Hospital. Women during the first 48 h after delivery were included. Polysomnography was performed in nonelevated and 45° elevated upper body position. Upper airway CSA was measured by acoustic pharyngometry in nonelevated, 45° elevated, and sitting body position.Results: Fifty-five patients were enrolled, and measurements of airway CSA obtained. Thirty patients completed polysomnography in both body positions. Elevation of the upper body significantly reduced apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from 7.7 ± 2.2/h in nonelevated to 4.5 ± 1.4/h in 45° elevated upper body position (P = .031) during sleep. Moderate to severe OSA (AHI > 15/h) was diagnosed in 20% of postpartum patients and successfully treated by elevated body position in one-half of them. Total sleep time and sleep architecture were not affected by upper body elevation. Change from nonelevated to sitting position increased inspiratory upper airway CSA from 1.35 ± 0.1 cm2 to 1.54 ± 0.1 cm2 during wakefulness. Position-dependent increase in CSA and decrease in AHI were correlated (r = 0.42, P = .022).Conclusions: Among early postpartum women, 45° upper body elevation increased upper airway CSA and mitigated sleep apnea.

Background: The well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers' capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may disrupt empathic processing. Methods: Original research papers (n = 7413) published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking. Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. Results: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of children and was partially explained by mothers' aversive response to infant crying. Conclusion: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based, incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.","2019-02","2019-02-14 12:27:13","2019-02-14 12:27:13","","84-103","","1","37","","Journal of Reproductive & Infant Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Infant; Human; Affective Disorders; CINAHL Database; PubMed; Systematic Review; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Child Development; Psycinfo; Maternal Behavior; Stress, Psychological; Child Abuse; Empathy -- In Pregnancy; Psychological Well-Being -- In Infancy and Childhood; Sleep Deprivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was hypothesized that skin-to-skin contact, because of its soothing effects, would increase sleep, lower activity level, and reduce heart rate. Eight healthy preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, who had reached 34 to 36 weeks gestation, experienced one session of skin-to-skin contact for an interfeeding interval. Observations were made once each minute using continuous videotape throughout three consecutive interfeeding intervals (before, during, and after skin-to-skin contact). Significant treatment effects were found by repeated-measures analysis of variance for behavioral state and activity level; pair-wise comparisons showed that quiet sleep frequency was significantly increased and activity level reduced during skin-to-skin contact. Infants had longer durations of quiet sleep during skin-to-skin contact. The Pearson product-moment correlation between heart rate and behavioral state was robust and generally linear, supporting use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure in these subjects. The findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact is a simple, cost-effective intervention that reduces activity and state-related energy expenditure.","1990-09","2019-02-14 12:27:13","2019-02-14 12:27:13","","445-451","","5 part 1","19","","Heart & Lung","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Infant; Human; Parent-Infant Bonding; Research Instruments; Clinical Assessment Tools; Analysis of Variance; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Mother-Infant Relations; Infant, Premature; Infant Behavior; Pilot Studies; Skin; Inpatients; Energy Metabolism -- In Infancy and Childhood; Heart Rate -- In Infancy and Childhood; Infant Stimulation; Intensive Care, Neonatal -- Methods; Touch -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Energy expenditure (EE) was measured during sleep (SleepEE, average EE from 0200-0500 hours) in a whole-room calorimeter, and total daily EE (TDEE) over 7 days using doubly labeled water. Glucose, insulin, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines were measured.Results: Body composition explained 70% variability in SleepEE, and SleepEE accounted for 67% to 73% of TDEE. Though there was no evidence of consistent low metabolism, there was considerable variability. Low SleepEE was associated with insulin resistance and low triiodothyronine concentrations (both P = 0.01). Physical activity level was 1.47 ± 0.02. For women with SleepEE within 100 kcal/d of their predicted EE, TDEE was significantly less than the estimate (2,530 ± 91 vs. 2,939 kcal/d; P < 0.001) provided from the most recent gestational energy requirement model.Conclusions: Pregnant women with obesity are inactive, possibly predisposing them to excess GWG. Current energy requirement models overestimate activity and may promote excess GWG in women with obesity. Furthermore, the observed large interindividual variability in basal metabolism may be important to consider when assessing the risk for excess GWG.","2018-06","2019-02-14 12:27:14","2019-02-14 12:27:14","","992-999","","6","26","","Obesity (19307381)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have previously shown that LG-SF induces metabolic dysfunction in offspring mice during adulthood.Objectives: To investigate the effects of late LG-SF on metabolic homeostasis in offspring and to determine the effects of LG-SF on the epigenome of visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) in the offspring.Methods: Time-pregnant mice were exposed to LG-SF or sleep control during LG (LG-SC) conditions during the last 6 days of gestation. At 24 weeks of age, lipid profiles and metabolic parameters were assessed in the offspring. We performed large-scale DNA methylation analyses using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled with microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in VWAT of 24-week-old LG-SF and LG-SC offspring (n=8 mice per group). Univariate multiple-testing adjusted statistical analyses were applied to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the groups. DMRs were mapped to their corresponding genes, and tested for potential overlaps with biological pathways and gene networks.Results: We detected significant increases in body weight (31.7 vs 28.8 g; P=0.001), visceral (642.1 vs 497.0 mg; P=0.002) and subcutaneous (293.1 vs 250.1 mg; P=0.001) fat mass, plasma cholesterol (110.6 vs 87.6 mg dl(-1); P=0.001), triglycerides (87.3 vs 84.1 mg dl(-1); P=0.003) and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance values (8.1 vs 6.1; P=0.007) in the LG-SF group.

A large proportion of the DMR-associated genes have reported functions that are altered in obesity and metabolic syndrome, such as Cartpt, Akt2, Apoe, Insr1 and so on. Overrepresented pathways and gene networks were related to metabolic regulation and inflammatory response.Conclusions: Our findings show a major role for epigenomic regulation of pathways associated with the metabolic processes and inflammatory responses in VWAT.

Materials and Methods: All children born to women with epilepsy and prospectively followed up through the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy (KREP), aged 6–8 years, were invited (n = 532). Out of the 254 children who responded, clinical evaluations and a 30-min digital 18 channel EEG were completed in 185 children. Results: Of the 185 children examined, 37 (20%) children (19 males, 18 females) had ED in their EEG. The EDs were generalized in 7 children, and focal in 30 children. The EDs were present in the sleep record only of 16 (43%) children and in the awake record only of 6 (16%) children. Out of the 94 children for whom seizure history was available, 7 children (7.4%) had seizures (neonatal seizures: 4, febrile seizure: 1, and single nonfebrile seizure: 2) and none had history of epilepsy or recurrent nonfebrile seizures. The odds ratio (OR) for occurrence of ED in the EEG was significantly higher for children of WWE [OR = 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-6.0] when compared to the published data for age-matched children of mothers without epilepsy. There was no association between the occurrence of ED and the children’s maternal characteristics [epilepsy syndrome, seizures during pregnancy, maternal intelligence quotient (IQ)] or the children’s characteristics [antenatal exposure to specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), birth weight, malformations, IQ].

Lactation requires the presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress, suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wall irritation and physiologic causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.","2001","2019-02-14 12:27:16","2019-02-14 12:27:16","","1763-1683","","9","63","","American Family Physician","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Education, Continuing (Credit); Diagnosis, Differential; Lactation -- Physiology; Lactation Disorders -- Chemically Induced; Lactation Disorders -- Diagnosis; Lactation Disorders -- Etiology; Lactation Disorders -- Therapy; Patient Education; Prolactin -- Drug Effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this evaluation was to compare parental knowledge and practices related to infant sleep before and after receipt of the safe sleep educational program and crib. A prospective, matched pre- and post-test cohort design with a follow-up survey was utilized to evaluate changes in knowledge and practices. Female participants were recruited through the county health department and met the following criteria: (1) between 32 and 40 weeks pregnant or within 3 months postpartum, and (2) demonstrated financial need. Participants completed a survey prior to the start of a group educational program and upon program completion. For those who agreed, a follow-up phone survey was conducted approximately 10 weeks after program completion or after the infant’s birth. McNemar’s Chi square tests were conducted to detect significant differences between specific items on pre-test, post-test, and follow-up surveys, and paired sample t tests were conducted to compare differences in knowledge and practice scores. A total of 132 participants completed matched pre- and post-test surveys and 76 completed follow-up surveys. Knowledge of recommendations regarding position, surface, environment, smoking, breastfeeding, and pacifier use increased significantly between pre- and post-test, with most participants maintaining knowledge at follow-up. The proportion of recommended practices also increased significantly. A group-based safe sleep educational program can be effective in reducing risky infant sleep practices.","2018-10","2019-02-14 12:27:17","2019-02-14 12:27:17","","848-855","","5","43","","Journal of Community Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Prospective Studies; Sudden Infant Death -- Prevention and Control; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Human; Expectant Mothers; Health Knowledge; Chi Square Test; T-Tests; Postnatal Period; Surveys; Breast Feeding; McNemar's Test; Smoking; Home Environment; Program Evaluation; Body Positions; Program Implementation; Parent-Infant Relations; Pretest-Posttest Design; Cribs -- Evaluation; Financial Support; Health Facility Departments; Medical Practice; Parental Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sleep space programmes of education and Pēpi-Pod baby beds require evaluation.Methods: Two hundred and forty Māori and Pacific women and infants were randomised 1:1, to the Pēpi-Pod sleep space programme, or to a control group with 'usual care'. When infants were under 2 weeks of age, baseline interviews occurred, followed up by interviews at 2 and 4 months of age to assess safe sleep knowledge, infant care practices and Pēpi-Pod use and acceptability. All participants were offered a New Zealand Standard approved portable cot.Results: At baseline, 25% of babies did not have a baby bed. Knowledge of smoking and bed-sharing as SUDI risks improved at follow-up in both groups. One quarter regularly bed-shared at follow-up in both groups. Intention to bed-share was a strong predictor of subsequent behaviour. Pēpi-Pods were regularly used by 46% at 2 months and 16% at 4 months follow-up.Conclusions: Bed-sharing and knowledge improvement were similar irrespective of group. It is likely that the impact of the intervention was reduced because the control group received better support than 'usual care' and all participants had a baby bed. New Zealand SUDI rates have declined since sleep space programmes have been available. Sleep space programmes should be prioritised for those with modifiable SUDI risk.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:27:17","2019-02-14 12:27:17","","377-382","","4","54","","Journal of Paediatrics & Child Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This pilot study examined parents' levels of morning or evening fatigue, number of uninterrupted sleep periods and length of sleep during the last trimester of pregnancy; and the relationship of sleep to parents' reports of fatigue. Methods: Data were collected from 24 midwestern, nulliparous couples, who completed the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue each morning and each evening on 4 consecutive days during the last trimester. Concurrently, the couples recorded sleep and wake periods in an activity diary. Results: Expectant mothers but not expectant fathers reported increasing levels of fatigue, especially morning fatigue, as the pregnancy progressed. Expectant fathers and mothers did not differ either in the night-time mean number of minutes of sleep obtained, or in the mean number of night-time uninterrupted 90-minute sleep cycles obtained. Fatigue and sleep were not significantly related for either mothers or fathers. Conclusions: These findings support the multidimensional nature of fatigue and indicate a need for perinatal health caregivers to develop individualized interventions for mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy. Fathers should also participate in future research of factors influencing the prenatal and postpartum experience.","1997-03","2019-02-14 12:27:20","2019-02-14 12:27:20","","49-54","","1","24","","Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Male; Descriptive Statistics; Power Analysis; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Time Factors; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Analysis of Variance; Diaries; Repeated Measures; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Visual Analog Scaling; Fatigue -- In Pregnancy; Midwestern United States; Pilot Studies; Expectant Parents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We recruited 16 pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes [mean ± sd age 34.1 ± 4.6 years, duration of diabetes 23.6 ± 7.2 years, baseline HbA1c 51±5 mmol/mol (6.8 ± 0.6%)] to a randomized crossover trial of sensor-augmented pump therapy vs automated closed-loop therapy. Questionnaires (Diabetes Technology Questionnaire, Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey) were completed before and after each intervention, with qualitative interviews at baseline and follow-up. Results Women described the benefits and burdens of closed-loop systems during pregnancy. Feelings of improved glucose control, excitement and empowerment were counterbalanced by concerns about device visibility, obsessive data checking and diminished attentiveness to hyper- and hypoglycaemia symptoms. Responding to questionnaires, eight participants felt less worry about overnight hypoglycaemia and that diabetes 'did not run their lives'; however, five reported that closed-loop increased time thinking about diabetes, and three felt it made sleep and preventing hyperglycaemia more problematic. Women slightly overestimated their glycaemic response to closed-loop therapy. Most became more positive in their technology attitudes throughout pregnancy. Women with more positive technology attitudes had higher degrees of overestimation, and poorer levels of glycaemic control. Conclusions Women displayed complex psychosocial responses to closed-loop therapy in pregnancy.

Design: Prospective, repeated measure, random sequencing, and experimental. Setting: Level III neonatal intensive-care unit of a tertiary care university pediatric hospital. Participants: Thirty preterm neonates, 25-35 weeks gestation. Interventions: Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and sleep state were recorded 12 minutes before, during, and 15 minutes after two heelsticks, one with and one without facilitated tucking. Hypothesis: Premature neonates will have less variation in heart rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation, shorter crying and sleep disruption times, and less fluctuation in sleep states in response to the painful stimulus of a heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. Results: Neonates demonstrated a lower mean heart rate 6-10 minutes post-stick (p < 0.04), shorter mean crying time (p < 0.001), shorter mean sleep disruption time (p < 0.001), and fewer sleep-state changes (p = 0.003) after heelstick with facilitated tucking than without.

Associations were found between mother–infant night-time proximity and postnatal (but not antenatal) maternal orientation.Conclusions:Findings offer modest support for the stability and construct validity of maternal orientation assessed in pregnancy and reveal antenatal attitudinal factors that influence maternal caregiving trajectories.","2014-05","2019-02-14 12:27:23","2019-02-14 12:27:23","","214-229","","3","32","","Journal of Reproductive & Infant Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Odds Ratio; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Coefficient Alpha; Summated Rating Scaling; Prenatal Care; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Retrospective Design; Maternal Attitudes; Parenting; Postnatal Care; Motherhood -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although 'separate but proximate sleep surfaces' for infants has been recommended since 2005, bed-sharing remains a common practice, especially among African Americans. This study examined factors associated with bed-sharing among African American and White mothers. Separate logistic regression models were constructed for African American and White respondents to the 2007-2010 Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System. The sample consisted of 806 African Americans and 1,680 Whites ( N = 2,486). A significantly larger proportion of African Americans (70.6 %) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.4 %). For both races, partner-related stress was significantly associated with bed-sharing; no significant differences were found between the two racial groups. For African Americans, partner stress (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) and maternal education of 13-15 years (OR 2.0: 1.2-3.4) or ≥16 years (OR 2.7: 1.1-6.3) was associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. For Whites, partner stress (OR 1.3: 1-1.8), breastfeeding (OR 2.5: 1.9-3.1), income of $35,000-$49,999 (OR 1.6: 1.2-2.3), being unmarried (OR 1.5: 1.1-2.2), needing money for food (OR 1.6: 1.1-2.3), and non-supine sleep (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) were associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. Differences were found in bed-sharing factors between racial groups which suggests a need for culturally-relevant, tailored safe infant sleep interventions. Providers should ask families about their infant's sleeping environment and address safety issues within that environment. More research is needed on the context and reasons for bed-sharing.","2015-04","2019-02-14 12:27:24","2019-02-14 12:27:24","","720-732","","4","19","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Middle Age; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Confidence Intervals; Blacks; Risk Assessment; Whites; Bed Sharing -- Ethnology; Wisconsin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study aimed to identify predictors of clinically significant insomnia among pregnant Latinas. Methods: A total of 1289 pregnant Latinas recruited from obstetric clinics completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and questions about demographics and sleep. Results: Clinically significant insomnia (ISI≥10) was present among 17% of participants. Significant correlates of clinically significant insomnia were higher scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) after removing the sleep item (47% of women with EPDS≥9 and 9% with EPDS<9), completing measures in English (rather than Spanish: 26% versus 13%), and income but not pregnancy week, age, highest education level, or marital status. The highest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (59%) was experienced by women with EPDS≥9 who completed measures in English. The lowest percentage of clinically significant insomnia (6.2%) was experienced by women with EPDS<9 who completed measures in Spanish. Conclusions: In this sample of low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking pregnant Latinas, rates of clinically significant insomnia appear to be higher than rates among nonpregnant Latinas. Rates of clinically significant insomnia are particularly high among Latinas with elevated depressive symptom severity, a known risk for insomnia. Acculturation, as indicated by completing measures in English, may be another risk specific to Latinas, possibly owing to loss of some ethnicity-specific protective factors (e.g., social support, strong family ties, and group identity). It will be important to directly test this explanation in future research.","2013-08","2019-02-14 12:27:24","2019-02-14 12:27:24","","694-701","","8","22","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","California; Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Depression; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; T-Tests; Confidence Intervals; Clinical Assessment Tools; Socioeconomic Factors; Kruskal-Wallis Test; One-Way Analysis of Variance; Mann-Whitney U Test; ROC Curve; Hispanics -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Pregnancy; Insomnia -- Etiology -- In Pregnancy; Kappa Statistic; Severity of Illness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This risk may be mitigated by engaging in healthy eating, physical activity, and weight loss when indicated. Since postpartum depressive symptoms may impair a woman's ability to engage in lifestyle changes, we sought to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms in the early postpartum period among women with recent GDM. The participants are part of the baseline cohort of the TEAM GDM (Taking Early Action for Mothers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) study, a one-year randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention program for women with a recent history of GDM, conducted in Boston, Massachusetts between June 2010 and September 2012. We administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 4-15 weeks postpartum to women whose most recent pregnancy was complicated by GDM (confirmed by laboratory data or medical record review). An EPDS score ≥9 indicated depressive symptoms. We measured height and thyroid stimulating hormone, and administered a questionnaire to collect demographic data and information about breastfeeding and sleep. We calculated body mass index (BMI) using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. We reviewed medical records to obtain data about medical history, including history of depression, mode of delivery, and insulin use during pregnancy. We conducted bivariable analyses to identify correlates of postpartum depressive symptoms, and then modeled the odds of postpartum depressive symptoms using multivariable logistic regression. Our study included 71 women (mean age 33 years ± 5; 59 % White, 28 % African-American, 13 % Asian, with 21 % identifying as Hispanic; mean pre-pregnancy BMI 30 kg/m ± 6). Thirty-four percent of the women scored ≥9 on the EPDS at the postpartum visit. In the best fit model, factors associated with depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum included cesarean delivery (aOR 4.32, 95 % CI 1.46, 13.99) and gestational weight gain (aOR 1.21 [1.02, 1.46], for each additional 5 lbs gained). Use of insulin during pregnancy, breastfeeding, personal history of depression, and lack of a partner were not retained in the model. Identifying factors associated with postpartum depression in women with GDM is important since depression may interfere with lifestyle change efforts in the postpartum period. In this study, cesarean delivery and greater gestational weight gain were correlated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women with recent GDM (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01158131).","2013-11","2019-02-14 12:27:25","2019-02-14 12:27:25","","1665-1672","","9","17","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Human; Funding Source; Life Style Changes; Data Analysis Software; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Randomized Controlled Trials; Obesity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 -- Risk Factors; Depression, Postpartum -- Complications; Massachusetts; Weight Gain; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Complications; Bivariate Statistics; Post Hoc Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insomnia data were collected pre-gestationally, in each trimester and six months post-partum, analysing five different moments. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to generate adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of determinants of insomnia in each trimester, defined using Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) as score ≥8.Results: Insomnia prevalence was 6.1% (3.9-8.9) pre-gestational, 44.2% (39.3-49.6) in first trimester (T1), 46.3% (41.9-51.3) in second (T2) and 63.7% (57.7-67.8) in third trimester (T3). Post-gestational insomnia was 33.2% (28.2-37.9) (p < 0.001 pre-gestational vs T1, T2 vs T3 and T3 vs after pregnancy). There was worsening mean AIS score, from: 2.34 before pregnancy to 9.87 in T3 because the deterioration of nighttime sleep, in absolute terms, but daytime impact was higher in T1. Previous trimester insomnia was associated with insomnia in T2 (aOR = 4.21, 95% CI 2.78-6.37) and T3 (aOR = 4.43, 95% CI 2.77-7.08).

The aims were to identify the most useful parameters of acculturation in relation to self-reported sleep disturbance and describe risk factors for sleep disturbance in women of Mexican descent. Background. Little is known about acculturation as a factor for poor sleep in the context of other personal factors such as income or sense of resilience or mastery for Latinas in the United States. Design. This study was a secondary analysis of cross sectional survey data. Methods. Personal factors were incorporated into a modification of the Conceptual Framework of Impaired Sleep to guide our secondary analysis of self-reported sleep disturbance. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 312 women of Mexican descent of childbearing age (21-40 years) located in an urban California community were collected and previously analysed in relation to depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder. The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (in English and Spanish) was used to assess sleep disturbance. Data was collected in 1998 from September through December. Results. Early socialization to the United States during childhood was the most useful acculturation parameter for understanding self-reported sleep disturbance in this sample. In a multivariate regression analysis, three factors (higher acculturation, lower income and higher depressive symptoms) were statistically significant in accounting for 40% of the variance in sleep disturbance. Conclusion. When low income Latinas of Mexican descent report sleep problems, clinicians should probe for environmental sleep factors associated with low income, such as noise, over-crowding and exposure to trauma and violence, and refer the woman to psychotherapy and counselling rather than merely prescribing a sleep medication.","2012-10","2019-02-14 12:27:38","2019-02-14 12:27:38","","2256-2266","","10","68","","Journal of Advanced Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","California; Female; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Marital Status; Depression; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Coefficient Alpha; Psychological Tests; Scales; Self Report; Summated Rating Scaling; T-Tests; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Educational Status; Clinical Assessment Tools; Surveys; Health Status; Urban Areas; Analysis of Variance; Income; Internal Consistency; Multiple Regression; P-Value; Employment Status; Conceptual Framework; Sleep Disorders -- Risk Factors; Secondary Analysis; Acculturation; Hardiness; Hispanics; Immigrants; Sleep Deprivation -- Risk Factors; Sleep Disorders -- Ethnology; Sleep Disorders -- Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, these changes can affect the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women, affecting both maternal and infant health. The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic, physical and psychological factors in developed countries.Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made in PubMed, EMBASE and BDSP (Public Health Database). Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Countries with a human development index over 0.7 were selected. The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of the STROBE criteria.Results: In total, thirty-seven articles were included. While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout pregnancy, the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy. Main factors associated with better QOL were mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age, the absence of social and economic problems, having family and friends, doing physical exercise, feeling happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic. Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction, complications before or during pregnancy, obesity, nausea and vomiting, epigastralgia, back pain, smoking during the months prior to conception, a history of alcohol dependence, sleep difficulties, stress, anxiety, depression during pregnancy and sexual or domestic violence.Conclusions: Health-related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical, mental and social dimensions of well-being. Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible.","2018-11-23","2019-02-14 12:27:40","2019-02-14 12:27:40","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","1","18","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A five year population based case-control study with parental interviews conducted for each case and three controls matched for age, place of birth, and last sleep period. A total of 203 SIDS cases and 622 control infants born 1994-98 were studied. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis, co-sleeping significantly increased the risk of SIDS both as a usual practice (adjusted OR 4.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 17.37) and during the last sleep period (adjusted OR 16.47; 95% CI 3.73 to 72.75). The associated risk was dependent on maternal smoking (OR 21.84; 95% CI 2.27 to 209.89), and was not significant for infants who were > or =20 weeks of age (OR 2.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 70.10) or placed back in their own cot/bed to sleep (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.21 to 5.41). The use of pillows, duvets, and bedding with tog value > or =10 were not significant risk factors when adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, including maternal smoking and social disadvantage. However, the prone sleeping position remains a significant SIDS risk factor, and among infants using soothers, the absence of soother use during the last sleep period also significantly increased the SIDS risk (OR 5.83; CI 2.37 to 14.36). CONCLUSION: Co-sleeping should be avoided in infants who are <20 weeks of age, or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. The prone position remains a factor in some SIDS deaths, and the relation between soother use and SIDS is a complex variable requiring further study.","2003-12","2019-02-14 12:27:40","2019-02-14 12:27:40","","1058-1064","","12","88","","Archives of Disease in Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Interviews; Odds Ratio; Logistic Regression; Infant; Human; Convenience Sample; Infant, Newborn; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Risk Factors; Confidence Intervals; Ireland; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Bed Sharing; Sudden Infant Death -- Epidemiology -- Ireland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Cross-sectional, quantitative data were collected from women (ages 15-35) seeking immunizations for their infants <6 months of age (N = 1061) in urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between maternal abuse (perinatal IPV, in-law violence and GBHM) and recent infant morbidity (diarrhea, respiratory distress, fever, colic and vomiting). Results: More than one in four women (28.4 %) reported IPV during their recent pregnancy and/or during the postpartum period, 2.6 % reported perinatal violence from in-laws, and 49.0 % reported one or more forms of perinatal GBHM. In adjusted regression models that included all forms of family violence and maltreatment, perinatal GBHM remained significantly associated with infant morbidity (AORs 1.4-1.9); perinatal IPV and in-law violence ceased to predict infant morbidity in models including GBHM. Conclusions: Findings indicate that non-violent expressions of gender inequity (e.g., nutritional deprivation, deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care during pregnancy) are more strongly associated with poor infant health than physical or sexual violence from husbands or in-laws in urban India. These results strongly suggest the need to expand the conception of gender inequities beyond IPV to include non-violent forms of gendered mistreatment in considering their impact on infant health.","2016-01","2019-02-14 12:27:41","2019-02-14 12:27:41","","149-157","","1","20","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Infant; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Middle Age; Descriptive Statistics; Postnatal Period; Confidence Intervals; India; Quantitative Studies; Disease -- Risk Factors -- In Infancy and Childhood; Domestic Violence -- In Pregnancy; Intimate Partner Violence -- In Pregnancy; Morbidity -- In Infancy and Childhood; Poverty Areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A convenience sample of 30 women, age 20-35 years, who were at less the 20 weeks' gestation and without health problems were included in the study. Physiologic, psychological, and environmental factors were measured and related to the occurrence and intensity of fatigue. Pearson correlations and content analysis were used to analyze the data. Results showed that a large portion of the sample (90%) experienced fatigue and that this fatigue had a significant impact on their ability to maintain personal and social activities. Significant correlations were observed between fatigue and the physiologic variables of nausea and feeling tired upon awakening from sleep. There was no significant relationship between fatigue and environmental variables such as number of hours worked or the number of children living in the home. In addition, significant correlations were observed between fatigue and psychological variables that included depression, anger, anxiety, and confusion. These data suggest that fatigue is a significant problem for pregnant women and is not relieved by rest. These data further suggest that the fatigue may be related to other physiologic changes, perhaps hormonal, that mediate physiologic and psychological variables, including fatigue.","1991-09","2019-02-14 12:27:42","2019-02-14 12:27:42","","303-309","","5","36","","Journal of Nurse-Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Human; Outpatients; Depression; Convenience Sample; Research Instruments; Pregnancy Discomforts; Anxiety; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Pregnancy -- Psychosocial Factors; Internal Consistency; Factor Analysis; Fatigue -- In Pregnancy; Content Analysis; Exploratory Research; Anger; Confusion; Fatigue -- Etiology -- In Pregnancy; Nausea; Reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: A hermeneutic phenomenological study. Setting: An inner city medical centre in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Patients: 5 men and 5 women with HIV infection (mean age 33 y, 80% African-American) who reported that fatigue had developed since their previous clinic appointment. Fatigue was severe enough to affect activity levels. All participants were receiving disability benefits, lived alone, and 7 reported previous substance abuse. Methods: Individual, semistructured interviews of 30-60 minutes were done at the clinic. Topics discussed were personal meanings of fatigue, subjective responses to fatigue, contextual description of when fatigue occurred and the interpretation of the fatigue, the effect fatigue had on daily life, how each person managed the fatigue, and how the fatigue associated with HIV infection was similar or different from non-HIV fatigue. Audiotapes were transcribed, initial interpretations were made, and a team of content experts achieved consensus on the findings. The team consisted of an expert in each of phenomenological research, clinical management of patients with HIV, and fatigue research. Main findings: Thematic analysis identified 3 concerns for participants. The first, fatigue as a signal of AIDS, showed that fatigue was seen as a critical factor in the fight against the disabling effects of disease progression and AIDS. Because fatigue seas variable, participants continuously evaluated their own fatigue and compared it with that of others. Fatigue was seen as an indication of disease status. 'It's a danger sign. A lot of my friends, the ones that went on, that's how it started with them.' The second concern was the body, the mind the social experience of fatigue. The sensation of the body being tired was intense and was seen as being different from previous experiences with other conditions such as pregnancy and intoxication primarily because the fatigue was felt to be linked to disease progression. Emotional awareness of fatigue was linked to feelings of tearfulness, isolation, and lack of motivation and contributed to a depressed mood and fear of the future. Fatigue led to changes in social aspects such as isolation, frustration on the part of both patients and families, and family members taking on protective roles. 'It's like being stuck in a dark, cold, clammy room where you can't get out. You can't go nowhere, you're not really locked in a room, you just can't get enough motivation to get out of it. It's just there.' The third concern was choosing ways to live with fatigue and addiction and involved both personal understandings and actions. Participants chose to push themselves to fight the fatigue, accept the fatigue as inevitable, come to terms with the need to pace themselves, think positively, and improve their lifestyles. Participants felt the need to stop alcohol and drug abuse and to try to come to terms with their disease and its progression while balancing what was important to them in their daily lives. 'To sit around and mope about it is a sign of defeat so I find things to do. Then I go and try to take a little nap. You've got to keep your mind on the right perspective. You're not dead.' Conclusions: Among people with HIV infection or AIDS, fatigue was seen as a barometer of disease progression. Participants developed ways to deal with the fatigue both physically and emotionally to achieve their desired activities.

The differential diagnosis of fatigue includes lifestyle issues, physical conditions, mental disorders, and treatment side effects. Fatigue can be classified as secondary to other medical conditions, physiologic, or chronic. The history and physical examination should focus on identifying common secondary causes (e.g., medications, anemia, pregnancy) and life-threatening problems, such as cancer. Results of laboratory studies affect management in only 5 percent of patients, and if initial results are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated. Treatment of all types of fatigue should include a structured plan for regular physical activity that consists of stretching and aerobic exercise, such as walking. Caffeine and modafinil may be useful for episodic situations requiring alertness. Short naps are proven performance enhancers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline, may improve energy in patients with depression. Patients with chronic fatigue may respond to cognitive behavior therapy. Scheduling regular follow-up visits, rather than sporadic urgent appointments, is recommended for effective long-term management.","2008-11-15","2019-02-14 12:27:43","2019-02-14 12:27:43","","1173-1179","","10","78","","American Family Physician","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Sleep; Education, Continuing (Credit); Fatigue -- Classification; Fatigue -- Epidemiology; Fatigue -- Therapy; Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic -- Prevention and Control; Physicians, Family","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the feasibility and acceptability of these devices in an authentic context is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second trimester until one month postpartum.Methods: The feasibility of a smart wristband was tested prospectively through pregnancy in nulliparous women (n = 20). The outcomes measured were the wear time of the device and the participants' experiences with the smart wristband. The data were collected from the wristbands, phone interviews, questionnaires, and electronic patient records. The quantitative data were analyzed with hierarchical linear mixed models for repeated measures, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.Results: Participants (n = 20) were recruited at a median of 12.9 weeks of gestation. They used the smart wristbands for an average of 182 days during the seven-month study period. The daily use of the devices was similar during the second (17.9 h, 95% CI 15.2 to 20.7) and third trimesters (16.7 h, 95% CI 13.8 to 19.5) but decreased during the postpartum period (14.4 h, 95% CI 11.4 to 17.4, p = 0.0079). Participants who could not wear smart wristbands at work used the device 300 min less per day than did those with no use limitations. Eight of the participants did not wear the devices or wore them only occasionally after giving birth. Nineteen participants reported that the smart wristband did not have any permanent effects on their behavior. Problems with charging and synchronizing the devices, perceiving the devices as uncomfortable, or viewing the data as unreliable, and the fear of scratching their babies with the devices were the main reasons for not using the smart wristbands.Conclusions: A smart wristband is a feasible tool for continuous monitoring during pregnancy. However, the daily use decreased after birth. The results of this study may support the planning of future studies and help with overcoming barriers related to the use of smart wristbands on pregnant women.","2019-01-17","2019-02-14 12:27:44","2019-02-14 12:27:44","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","1","19","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The health of Russia's population, including reproductive health, to date, represents the State value. In recent years, in Russian Federation, there is a trend to an increase in fertility, including in connection with transition from 2012 registration of childbirth recommendations of the WHO with 22 weeks of gestation, but is directly proportional to increasing morbidity and mortality through early disability and perinatal morbidity. The highest frequency of adverse perinatal outcomes occurs in placental insufficiency, particularly in critical condition in the fetus, resulting in the subsequent health of the future generation. The aim of our study is to investigate the morbidity of babies in the first year of life birth on antenatal diagnosed critical state of the fetus. The highest perinatal mortality, high perinatal morbidity with the outcome of the disability we get at the critical state of the fetus, which should be understood as a degree of violation of the morphofunctional state in which the depletion of the compensatory mechanisms is the high risk antenatal, intrapartum or early neonatal death. According to various authors, the perinatal mortality rate in critical condition of the fetus reaches 9.3‰, early neonatal and 7.5‰. or the critical condition of the fetus characterized by early and very early preterm birth, severe perinatal CNS damage, respiratory distress syndrome, which subsequently affects the health status of children born in decompensated placental insufficiency. The aim of our research is the study of morbidity of children of the first year of life, born with antenatal diagnosed critical condition of the fetus. A clinical prospective study of 83 pregnant women with complicated critical to the fetus during pregnancy. The results of the study revealed high perinatal morbidity. Perinatal loss in the study group was 1.8‰ (N=15 ). Of the 8 surviving children, only 33 (48,5%) were observed later in the study of the catamnesis. When studying the history of the development of children during the first year of life with a critical antenatal diagnosed fetal-placental blood flow was noticed by the high frequency of infectious, allergic, neurological morbidity, abnormalities of bone and cartilage system of the visual apparatus. When analyzing the frequency and duration of monitoring by a neurologist, we have identified the expected high frequency of neurological pathology in children with antenatal critical condition. So, all children up to 1 year of life and further consisted on the account at the neurologist, which was due not only to the severity of CNS damage, but also by prematurity. The effects of neonatal ivh transferred 2-4 degree newborns manifested in children over 1 year of life in the form of hypertension-hydrocephalic syndrome in 5 children (15,1%), ischemic brain infarction in the region of the ""island zone"" with the subsequent formation of cystic leukomalacia in 1 child at 1 month of life. For these children, a characteristic diagnosis to the end of the 1st year of life was cerebral palsy (N=6, 18.2 %). It should be noted the high frequency of perinatal encephalopathy among children in this group (100%). Among the violations of psychomotor development we were allocated a syndrome of increased neuro-reflex irritability (restlessness, sleep disturbances, frequent and persistent vomiting) in 3 children (10,5%). The syndrome of autonomic dysfunction remained until 1 year of life in 24 (71,72%) children, premature live births, respectively gestational age was fading reflexes motor automatism, spinal reflexes, had a late start walking, crawling, ability to sit. There was a high frequency of diagnosis of retinopathy and risk of all children observed in the study of the catamnesis, which is natural, as in decompensated MON characteristic for newborns preterm labor, and abnormalities of cerebral blood flow including microcirculation in the body. For infants born with antenatal diagnosed with a critical condition of the fetus, characterized by high incidence of infectious disease (more than 2 times per year) in 7(21%) children by the end of 1 the first year of life. Allergic reactions manifest in the first year of life are clinically atopic dermatitis in 5 (15,1%), a high frequency which could be explained not only by prematurity at birth, but also the fact that the majority of children in this group were on artificial feeding. Thus, the results of the study showed that children born with antenatal diagnosed with a critical condition are at high risk of development of neurological pathology, physical, infectious, allergic morbidity, which may further entail the delay of psychomotor, speech development, with a likely outcome in the disability and social maladjustment.","2017-10-02","2019-02-14 12:27:45","2019-02-14 12:27:45","","337-338","","","45","","Journal of Perinatal Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Health Status; Morbidity; Congresses and Conferences -- Serbia; Fetal Abnormalities -- In Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Serbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to extract simultaneous recordings of fetal cardiac and brain‐related activity in BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women using a novel non‐invasive biomagnetic technique. Design: A pilot study was conducted, recording and analyzing biomagnetic data from fetuses of BUP‐maintained and non‐opioid exposed pregnant women. Signals were acquired with the non‐invasive 151‐channel SARA (SQUID‐Array for Reproductive Assessment) system. Advanced signal‐processing techniques were applied to extract fetal heart and brain activity. Setting: University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA). Participants: Eight BUP‐maintained pregnant women from UAMS Women's Mental Health Program between gestational ages (GA) of 29–37 weeks who were treated with 8–24 mg of BUP daily. Sixteen pregnant women with no known opioid exposure in the same GA range were also included. Measurements: Outcome measures from the fetal heart and brain signals included: heart rate (FHR), FM, FHR accelerations, FHR–FM coupling, FHRV, fetal behavioral states (FBS) and power spectral density (PSD) of spontaneous brain activity. These measures were analyzed at three GA intervals. Findings: Fetal heart and brain activity parameters were extracted and quantified successfully from 18 non‐opioid and 16 BUP recordings. Overall analysis in both groups show that: FHR and FM ranged from 131 to 141 beats per minute (b.p.m.) and 5 to 11 counts, respectively. In the 35–37 weeks GA, the coupling duration (~9 s) was the shortest, while three of the FHRV parameters were the highest. The PSD of brain activity revealed highest power in 0.5‐4 Hz bandwidth.

While the mother spends the bulk of her sleep time during pregnancy in NREM (non REM) Stage N2 (light) sleep, the developing baby spends the bulk of its sleep time in REM. Fetal REM is synchronized with maternal wake-rest activity schedules and is tightly coupled to respiratory physiology. Fetal REM exhibits hormonal and sensory signaling functions as well. The absence of sufficient fetal REM activity is associated with fetal distress and may be interpreted as a danger signal by the pregnant mother. It is suggested that maternal N2 NREM light sleep allows the mother to quickly awaken and respond to any danger signals received from internal or external sources. Near term NREM Stage N3 (slow wave activity) helps initiate birth contractions. At birth fetal REM is maximal and declines rapidly in the neonate.","2012-01","2019-02-14 12:27:47","2019-02-14 12:27:47","","58-63","","1","27","","International Journal of Childbirth Education","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Expectant Mothers; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Fetal Development; Electroencephalography; Sleep Stages; Sleep -- In Utero; Sleep, REM; Waveforms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neurological morbidity evaluated included hospitalizations in childhood involving pervasive developmental disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and infantile spasms and disorders of eating as recorded in the hospital files. Multiple pregnancies and fetal congenital malformations were excluded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare the cumulative neurological morbidity over the study period. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for obstetrical confounders, including gestational age at birth, birth weight, and maternal factors.Results: During the study period, 240,953 newborns were included in the long-term analysis: 51.0% (n = 122,840) males and 49.0% (n = 118,113) females.

RECENT FINDINGS: Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns. Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more common in men. SUMMARY: Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy.","2006-11","2019-02-14 12:27:48","2019-02-14 12:27:48","","383-389","","6","12","","Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Male; Sleep -- Physiology; Menopause -- Physiology; Sex Factors; Sleep Disorders -- Physiopathology; Menstrual Cycle -- Physiology; Pregnancy -- Physiology; Puberty -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Susceptibility to misalignment of circadian rhythms may be partly genetically influenced and effects on sleep quality and duration could predispose to poorer health outcomes. Shorter sleep duration is associated with obesity traits, which are brought on by an increased opportunity to eat and/or a shift of hormonal profile promoting hunger. We hypothesised that increased sleep duration will offset susceptible genetic effects, resulting in reduced obesity risk.Methods: We recruited 643 (male: 338; female: 305) European children born to participants in the New Zealand centre of the International Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints sleep study. Ten genes directly involved in the circadian rhythm machinery and a further 20 genes hypothesised to be driven by cyclic oscillations were evaluated by Sequenom assay. Multivariable regression was performed to test the interaction between gene variants and average sleep length (derived from actigraphy), in relation to obesity traits (body mass index (BMI) z-scores and percentage body fat (PBF)).Results: No association was found between average sleep length and BMI z-scores (p = 0.056) or PBF (p = 0.609). Uncorrected genotype associations were detected between STAT-rs8069645 (p = 0.0052) and ADIPOQ-rs266729 (p = 0.019) with differences in average sleep duration. Evidence for uncorrected gene-by-sleep interactions of the CLOCK-rs4864548 (p = 0.0039), PEMT-936108 (p = 0.016) and GHRELIN-rs696217 (p = 0.046) were found in relation to BMI z-scores but not for PBF.Conclusion: Our results indicate that children may have different genetic susceptibility to the effects of sleep duration on obesity.

Little, however, is known about the consequences of insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during pregnancy on glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes.Methods: A cohort of 1,290 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic testing for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were abstracted from medical records. Generalized linear models were fitted to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of GDM associated with sleep duration and snoring, respectively.Results: After adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, GDM risk was increased among women sleeping < or = 4 hours compared with those sleeping 9 hours per night (RR = 5.56; 95% CI 1.31-23.69). The corresponding RR for lean women (<25 kg/m2) was 3.23 (95% CI 0.34-30.41) and 9.83 (95% CI 1.12-86.32) for overweight women (> or = 25 kg/m2). Overall, snoring was associated with a 1.86-fold increased risk of GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94). The risk of GDM was particularly elevated among overweight women who snored. Compared with lean women who did not snore, those who were overweight and snored had a 6.9-fold increased risk of GDM (95% CI 2.87-16.6).Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest associations of short sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM. Though consistent with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger studies that include objective measures of sleep duration, quality and apnea are needed to obtain more precise estimates of observed associations.","2010-01","2019-02-14 12:27:50","2019-02-14 12:27:50","","17-17","","","10","","BMC Women's Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Adult; Human; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Sleep Deprivation -- Metabolism; Pilot Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Metabolism; Glucose Intolerance; Snoring -- Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preterm birth is defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation. Infants born late preterm (34-36 weeks) are considered more similar to early preterm (> 34 weeks) than to full-term infants, despite previously regarded as near-term (Raju Higgins, Stark, & Leveno, 2006). For preterm infants, sleeping functions are critical as they demonstrate the ability to adjust to biological and social rhythms and support emotional regulation, learning, and memory. Many studies have focused on sleep patterns of full-term infants; however, few have investigated preterm infants and none have compared early and late preterm infants with a population from the Republic of Ireland. The purpose of this study was to identify infant and parent characteristics that promote optimal sleep in preterm infants and to establish whether the parent-infant relationship mediates this association. A secondary purpose was to test the transactional model of sleep. Parent report of infant sleep was taken from a recent population-based dataset from the Republic of Ireland. A comparison of the day and nighttime sleep patterns of early and late preterm infants found no difference between groups. There was also no difference in infant temperament, breast-feeding, parental stress, depression, or sociodemographics. A difference was found between groups in infant development, weight at 9 months, and age infant began solid foods. This finding was not surprising as infants born early preterm are at greater at greater risk of developmental delay and disability. Results of this study suggest that the paternal-infant relationship has a mediating impact on the relationship between infant temperament and nighttime waking in the early preterm group only, while the maternal-infant relationship has a mediating role in both groups. These findings add to the body of knowledge on the transactional model of sleep, and are the first to identify infant temperament and the paternal-infant relationship as important factors. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the transactional model of sleep and recommendations for future research are presented.","2015-01","2019-02-14 12:27:50","2019-02-14 12:27:50","","","304 p","","","","","","","","","","Virginia Commonwealth University","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3703061","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Human; Comparative Studies; Time Factors; Ireland; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Infant, Premature; Infant Development; Temperament -- In Infancy and Childhood; Parent-Infant Relations; Models, Theoretical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most patients were aged between 16 and 19 years, had a steady partner, between seven and nine years of schooling, were homemakers, had a family income of one to three minimum wages. The most common guidelines were the importance of early prenatal care, the prenatal booklet, exams, vaccination, about smoking, alcohol intake, use of ferrous sulfate and folic acid. The less frequent information was related to weight control, healthy eating, physical exercise, balance between sleep and rest, practice of sexual activity and use of condom during sexual intercourse. The conclusion is that guidance provided during the prenatal period has biological approach and the guidelines with a holistic view on adolescents were carried out less frequently.","2015-07","2019-02-14 12:27:51","2019-02-14 12:27:51","","1323-1329","","3","14","","Ciencia, Cuidado e Saude","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Adolescence; Descriptive Research; Human; Self Care; Young Adult; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Prenatal Care; Counseling; Health Promotion; Practice Guidelines; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Weight Gain; Smoking; Quantitative Studies; Home Visits; Alcohol Abuse; Contraception; Folic Acid; Immunization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable since pregnancy increases the risk of both SDB and depressive symptoms. However, no study has investigated whether SDB symptoms prior to or in early pregnancy are associated with such mood problems.Methods: A retrospective chart review of pregnant women. Women were included if they attended prenatal clinics between June 2007 and July 2010, were ≥18 years old, pregnant with a single fetus, and had been screened for habitual snoring as well as depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS).Results: In total, 362 women were included and 32.3% reported habitual snoring. Twenty-nine percent of women had an EPDS score ≥10. Significantly more snoring women, compared to non-snorers, had an EPDS score ≥10 (42.7% vs. 22.9%, p < 0.001) despite the mean EPDS values not reaching statistical significance (6.1 ± 4.9 vs. 5.4 ± 5.0, p = 0.2). In a logistic regression model controlling for parity, the presence of pre-pregnancy obesity, presence of a partner, sleep quality, African American race, maternal educational level, pre-eclampsia, and diabetes, snoring was independently associated with a prenatal EPDS score ≥10 (O.R. 2.0, 95%CI 1.13-3.46; p = 0.023).Conclusion: Maternal snoring may be a risk factor for prenatal depressive symptoms.

Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify 'red flag symptoms' suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.","2017-10-19","2019-02-14 12:27:52","2019-02-14 12:27:52","","1-20","","1","18","","Journal of Headache & Pain","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications -- Risk Factors; Human; Systematic Review; Breast Feeding; Drug Therapy -- Adverse Effects -- In Utero; Fetal Abnormalities -- Risk Factors; Fetus -- Drug Effects; Headache -- Classification; Headache -- Etiology; Headache -- In Pregnancy; Headache -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Those allocated to the HC group received a tailored HC intervention delivered by a Health Coach, whilst those in the EA group attended two education sessions. Women completed measures, including motivation, psychosocial variables, sleep quality, and knowledge, beliefs and expectations concerning GWG, at 15 weeks of gestation (Time 1) and 33 weeks of gestation (Time 2). Post-birth data were also collected at 2 months post-partum (Time 3).Results: There was no intervention effect in relation to weight gained during pregnancy, rate of excessive GWG or birth outcomes. The only differences between HC and EA women were higher readiness (b = 0.29, 95% CIs = 0.03-0.55, p < .05) and the importance to achieve a healthy GWG (b = 0.27, 95% CIs = 0.02-0.52, p < .05), improved sleep quality (b = -0.22, 95% CIs = -0.44 to -0.03, p < .05), and increased knowledge for an appropriate amount of GWG that would be best for their baby's health (b = -1.75, 95% CI = -3.26 to -0.24, p < .05) reported by the HC at Time 2.Conclusions: Whilst the HC intervention was not successful in preventing excessive GWG, several implications for the design of future GWG interventions were identified, including the burden of the intervention commitment and the use of weight monitoring.Statement Of Contribution: What is already known on the subject? Designing interventions to address gestational weight gain (GWG) continues to be a challenge. To date, health behaviour change factors have not been the focus of GWG interventions. What does this study add? Our health coaching (HC) intervention did not reduce GWG more so than education alone (EA). There was an intervention effect on readiness and importance to achieve healthy GWG. Yet there were no group differences regarding confidence to achieve healthy GWG post-intervention.","2016-02","2019-02-14 12:27:54","2019-02-14 12:27:54","","31-51","","1","21","","British Journal of Health Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Adult; Human; Health Behavior; Risk Factors; Comparative Studies; Attitude to Health; Randomized Controlled Trials; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Weight Gain; Victoria; Obesity -- Prevention and Control; Pregnancy Complications -- Prevention and Control; Health Education -- Methods; Health Education -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Health Promotion -- Methods; Motivation; Program Evaluation -- Statistics and Numerical Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The plant is situated in a suburb of Monterrey, which is the third most populous city in Mexico and the second most industrialized. A cross-sectional study design was used for the investigation, which was carried out from September 1994 to November 1994. Using cluster sampling procedures, homes in two areas were selected--one exposed through proximity to the plant, and the other unexposed to serve as a control--until the desired sample size was achieved (621 individuals, with an average of five per dwelling). A specially trained psychology student administered a questionnaire to an adult member of each family, soliciting data on the presence of acute and chronic infections, complications of pregnancy, and congenital diseases among the family members. One hundred twenty-seven questionnaires were administered in the exposed population, yielding information on 596 individuals. In the unexposed population, 147 questionnaires were administered furnishing data on 743 individuals. The sex and age distributions of the two populations were similar. The unexposed population had a slightly longer average duration of residence. The most common health problems in the exposed population were irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, allergies, sleep disturbances, bronchitis, excessive fatigue, skin problems, otitis, and anemia. The exposed population had significantly higher risks for skin eruptions and diseases, excessive fatigue, sleep disturbances, upper respiratory infections, otitis, bronchitis, and allergies. Exposed and unexposed women had comparable prevalences of obstetrical problems, spontaneous abortions, congenitally malformed offspring, and low birthweight. The questionnaire used to detect health problems has low sensitivity and may have generated underestimates of some conditions. Nevertheless, the analysis controlled for several different biases, and thus it can be concluded that a positive association exists between environmental exposure to these wastes and increased risk of disease.","1998-03","2019-02-14 12:27:54","2019-02-14 12:27:54","","152-157","","3","3","","Revista Panamericana de Salud Publica","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Male; Descriptive Statistics; Prevalence; Confidence Intervals; Single-Blind Studies; Control Group; Sex Factors; Reproduction; Environmental Exposure -- Mexico; Industrial Waste -- Mexico; Mexico; Mortality; Recycling -- Mexico; Sampling Methods; Symptoms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response). RESULTS: Overall, 9.2% of all women 'usually' chose prone infant sleep position, while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics (6.1%) or other sites (8.3%).

Chinese herbal use is a common practice to enhance reproductive health. 'Good' menstrual health facilitates fertility and sets a positive stage for pregnancy during the childbearing years. Many Chinese Americans use traditional Chinese health practices, but they are less likely to disclose these practices. Although the upward trend of herbal use is more prevalent among women and ethnic minorities, little data are available about herbal use in these populations.The overall aim of this dissertation was to examine the influences of health promoting behaviors and the perimenstrual symptom experience on Chinese herbal use among childbearing-age Chinese American women from the theoretical perspectives of Chinese culture, women's health, and health promotion. This cross-sectional, descriptive study included 103 Chinese American women, 21 to 40 years, responding to self-administered questionnaires. Follow-up data were collected prospectively on a subset of the women regarding their perimenstrual symptoms during menstruation.Over 90% of women reported past use of Chinese herbs; 22% were current herbal users; and 70% had consumed Chinese herbs for relief of perimenstrual symptoms, with 55% to 95% of them experiencing relief. Current herbal users were significantly less acculturated. The primary reason for using Chinese herbs was enhanced sense of well-being. A majority of herbal users did not inform their Western health provider of their herbal use. Being less acculturated and engaging in nutrition-related health promoting behaviors were statistically significant determinants of Chinese herbal use.Most women experienced minimal severity of perimenstrual symptoms. Abdominal bloating, fatigue, and breast soreness were the most prevalent and severe symptoms reported retrospectively and prospectively. Uterine cramps were more prevalent during the menstrual period only. Although there were no statistically significant perimenstrual symptom differences between herbal and non-herbal users, women who reported a higher severity of sleep disturbance and emotional related perimenstrual symptoms were more likely to use Chinese herbs.Congruent with Chinese culture, which values health promotion, a majority of the women were relatively healthy and engaged routinely in health promoting behaviors. One such health promoting practice was the use of Chinese herbs for relief of perimenstrual symptoms.","2005-01","2019-02-14 12:27:56","2019-02-14 12:27:56","","","138 p","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Francisco","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3179968","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Chinese; Dysmenorrhea -- Drug Therapy; Menstruation; Plants, Medicinal -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lack of information on the health impact of prematurity hinders the possibility of any effective public health interventions in this regard. Our aim was to determine the association between preterm birth and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) among 3 years old children in the Gampaha district, Sri Lanka.Methods: A community-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 790 preterm and term born children who were 03 years old. Multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used to identify children. The exposure status, a preterm birth, was established using the maternal pregnancy records. Outcome status was measured using a validated health related quality of life questionnaire (prepared in Sinhala) for preschool-aged children. Mothers of the children responded to an interviewer-administered questionnaire which had variables on the exposure status, outcome and additional variables such as child development status and birth related information. Quality of life was measured in twelve different domains of health (subscales). The impact was analyzed using the multiple linear regression.Results: Response rate was 95.5% (n = 379) for preterm group and 95.2% (n = 378) for term-born group. Health-Related Quality of Life scores obtained by preterm children were lower than the term born children in eight subscales. Preterm birth showed statistically significant association with subscales on sleep wellbeing, general wellbeing and abdominal symptoms in the adjusted analysis (p < 0.05). Among preterm children prolonged illness, delayed development status, socio economic status and maternal perception on the health status of the child were common predictors of quality of life.Conclusion: Preterm birth affected health related quality of life of preschool aged children.","2018-06-15","2019-02-14 12:27:56","2019-02-14 12:27:56","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","1","18","","BMC Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored significantly lower on all SF-36 domains, as well as on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean delivery, poorer sleep quality, life stress, and less social support predicted poorer mental health status.","2006-03","2019-02-14 12:27:57","2019-02-14 12:27:57","","95-102","","2","9","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Physical Activity; Semi-Structured Interview; Canada; Pregnancy Complications; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Scales; Self Report; T-Tests; Health Status -- In Pregnancy; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Retrospective Design; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Severity of Illness Indices; Multiple Regression; Sleep Disorders -- In Pregnancy; Depression, Postpartum -- Risk Factors; Exercise Test, Cardiopulmonary; Health Status Indicators; Life Change Events -- In Pregnancy; Physiological Theory; Social Networks -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interventions designed specifically to promote the mental health of men during the transition to parenthood are scarce. Internet-delivered interventions may be acceptable and far-reaching in enhancing mental health, parenting knowledge, and healthy behaviors in expectant or new fathers.Objective: To guide the development of Healthydads.ca, a website designed to enhance mental health and healthy behaviors in expectant fathers, a needs assessment was conducted to identify fathers' perspectives of barriers to seeking help for emotional wellness, informational needs, and factors affecting the decision to visit such a website.Methods: One hundred and seventy-four men whose partners were expecting, or had recently given birth, in 3 Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta) completed a Web-based survey inquiring about information needs related to psychosocial aspects of the transition to parenthood, lifestyle behaviors, parenting, and factors associated with the decision to visit a father-focused website.Results: Most men (155/174, 89.1%) reported accessing the Internet to obtain information on pregnancy and spent an average of 6.2 hours online per month. Seeking information about parenting on the Internet was reported by 67.2% (117/174) of men, with a mean of 4.4 hours per month of online searching. Top barriers to seeking help to improve emotional wellness during the perinatal period were: no time to seek help/assistance (130/174, 74.7%), lack of resources available in the health care system (126/174, 72.4%), financial costs associated with services (118/174, 67.8%), and feeling that one should be able to do it alone (113/174, 64.9%). Information needs that were rated highly included: parenting/infant care (52.9-81.6%), supporting (121/174, 69.5%) and improving (124/174, 71.3%) relationship with their partner, work-family balance (120/174, 69.0%), improving sleep (100/174, 57.5%), and managing stress (98/174, 56.3%). Perceiving the website as personally relevant (151/174, 86.8%), credible (141/174, 81.0%), effective (140/145, 80.5%), and having an easy navigation structure (141/174, 81.0%) were identified as important factors related to a first website visit. Providing useful (134/174, 77.0%) and easy to understand (158/174, 90.8%) information, which was also free of charge (156/174, 89.7%), were considered important for deciding to prolong a website visit. Providing the possibility to post questions to a health professional (133/174, 76.4%), adding new content regularly (119/174, 68.4%), and personal motivation (111/174, 63.8%) were factors identified that would encourage a revisit.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that there is substantial interest among expectant and new fathers for using Internet-delivered strategies to prepare for the transition to parenthood and support their mental health.

A visual analog scale (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created: (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 of the 2 time points (hereafter named ""mixed)"", and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10). Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine, upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.","2015-12","2019-02-14 12:27:59","2019-02-14 12:27:59","","2468-2478","","12","156","","Pain (03043959)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Young Adult; Severity of Illness Indices; Smoking -- Epidemiology; Depression -- Epidemiology; Motor Activity; Anxiety -- Epidemiology; Cold; Contraceptives, Oral -- Therapeutic Use; Dysmenorrhea -- Epidemiology; Hyperalgesia -- Epidemiology; Hyperalgesia -- Physiopathology; Pain Threshold -- Physiology; Pressure; Stress, Psychological -- Epidemiology; Western Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Retrospective review of 90 adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) matched for age and gender, comparing two groups, Group A: body mass index (BMI) < 35, Group B: BMI >= 45. Exclusion criteria: age < 18 years, pregnancy, >= 5 central apneas/hour, BMI >= 35 < 45. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Hypopnea/apnea ratio (HAR); secondary measures: obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive and central apnea indices, hypopnea index (HI), oxygen saturation (SpO2) nadir, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2), and presence of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Statistical methods: t-test for independent samples; Mann-Whitney, linear regression with natural log transformation, and Kruskal-Wallis [chi](2). Descriptive statistics were expressed as interquartile range, median and mean ± standard deviation, p < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: Group A (n = 45): age = 50.6 ± 11.5 years, BMI = 28.9 ± 4 kg/m(2); Group B (n = 45): age = 47.4 ± 12.7 years, BMI = 54.5 ± 8 kg/m(2).

Little is known about the co-occurrence of OSA among pregnant women from low and middle-income countries.Methods: We examined the extent to which maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity status are associated with high risk for OSA, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness in 1032 pregnant women in Lima, Peru. The Berlin questionnaire was used to identify women at high risk for OSA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were used to examine sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression procedures were employed to estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for putative confounding factors.Results: Compared with lean women (<25 kg/m(2)), overweight women (25-29.9 kg/m(2)) had 3.69-fold higher odds of high risk for OSA (95% CI 1.82-7.50). The corresponding aOR for obese women (≥30 kg/m(2)) was 13.23 (95% CI: 6.25-28.01). Obese women, as compared with their lean counterparts had a 1.61-fold higher odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.00-2.63).Conclusion: Overweight or obese pregnant women have increased odds of sleep disorders, particularly OSA. OSA screening and risk management may be indicated among pregnant women in low and middle income countries, particularly those undergoing rapid epidemiologic transitions characterized by increased prevalence of excessive adult weight gain.","2015-01","2019-02-14 12:28:01","2019-02-14 12:28:01","","198-198","","1","15","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sleep and wake states of newborns provide a tool for assessing the functional integrity of the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether CNS integrity in newborns, measured with sleep recordings, was associated with maternal concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA. DESIGN: Plasma phospholipid fatty acid concentrations were measured in 17 women at parturition. On postpartum day 1 (P1) and day 2 (P2), a pressure-sensitive pad under the infants' bedding recorded body movements and respiratory patterns to measure sleep and wake states. RESULTS: Maternal plasma phospholipid DHA ranged from 1.91% to 4.5% by wt of total fatty acids. On the basis of previously published data and the median DHA concentration, the women were divided into 2 groups: high DHA (> 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids) and low DHA (</= 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids). Infants of high-DHA mothers had a significantly lower ratio of active sleep (AS) to quiet sleep (QS) and less AS than did infants of low-DHA mothers. Furthermore, the former infants had less sleep-wake transition and more wakefulness on P2. Correlations of maternal DHA status with infant sleep states were consistent with these data. Also, the ratio of maternal n-6 to n-3 fatty acids on P1 was inversely associated with QS and positively associated with arousals in QS. On P2, maternal n-6:n-3 was positively associated with AS, sleep-wake transition, and AS:QS. CONCLUSION: The sleep patterns of infants born to mothers with higher plasma phospholipid DHA suggest greater CNS maturity.

Current risk factors are insufficient to identify women at greatest risk of developing an adverse outcome. An attempt to identify novel contributors to increased risk is warranted. Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, yet are often dismissed as irrelevant. Emerging evidence indicates that sleep disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. Disturbed sleep is also linked with an increased inflammatory response. Increased inflammation is proposed as a key biological pathway through which chronic disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes develop. In this paper, we propose a model and a testable hypothesis of how disturbed sleep in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth via increased inflammation.Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Leaning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to outline data linking sleep disturbances with an increased risk of some systemic disorders, recall characteristics of pregnancy complications which support the hypothesis that sleep disturbances may be related to these pregnancy outcomes, and summarize the likelihood and types of sleep disturbances that are common in pregnant women.","2009-04","2019-02-14 12:28:04","2019-02-14 12:28:04","","273-280","","4","64","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Infant, Newborn; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Etiology; Sleep Disorders -- Complications; Inflammation -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Well-conducted systematic reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size. In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia.Method.Reviews were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs that may be prone to bias.Results.High- and moderate-quality evidence shows that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections, childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), particularly in certain ethnic groups. Developmental motor delays and lower intelligence quotient in childhood and adolescence are apparent.Conclusions.We conclude that while our knowledge of schizophrenia is very substantial, our understanding of it remains limited.","2014-12","2019-02-14 12:28:05","2019-02-14 12:28:05","","3387-3405","","16","44","","Psychological Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Odds Ratio; Human; Effect Size; Risk Factors; CINAHL Database; Medline; Systematic Review; Schizophrenia; Embase; Psycinfo; Knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Analysis of 574 measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE, assessed by the doubly-labelled water method); basal metabolic rate (BMR, directly measured or derived from similar directly measured proxy measures such as during sleep); activity energy expenditure (AEE, derived as TEE-BMR); and physical activity level (PAL, derived as TEE/BMR) from people aged 2-95 years. The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc). Results: A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 x BMR and 4.5 x BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11% less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated. Conclusions: There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.","1996-02","2019-02-14 12:28:06","2019-02-14 12:28:06","","72-92","","2","50","","European Journal of Clinical Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Child; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Male; Middle Age; Socioeconomic Factors; Regression; Aged; Child, Preschool; Sex Factors; Exercise Physiology; Body Constitution; Aged, 80 and Over; Energy Metabolism -- Physiology; Great Britain; Isotopes; Methodological Research; Water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fetal behavioral state observations were made with simultaneous recordings of fetal heart rate, gross fetal body movements, and fetal eye movement between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM. During the first episode of behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep state) greater than or equal to 10 minutes duration on two consecutive half days, the vibratory stimulus was placed on the surface of the maternal abdomen over the fetal head. Each fetus received one 5-second vibratory stimulus during either the first or second half day of observation. The time at which the instrument was applied but no vibratory stimulus was administered was considered as the control period. All women were then observed for 2 hours after the control period and after stimulation. A transition period from a quiet sleep state to a stable active sleep state (state 2F, rapid eye movement sleep) averaged less than or equal to 3 minutes after stimulation, as compared with 23 minutes after the control period. These changes in fetal behavioral states persisted for 20 minutes after vibratory stimulation. There also was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term fetal heart rate variability, the number of fetal heart rate accelerations and gross fetal body movement during the first 20 minutes after stimulus, without changes in basal fetal heart rate. We hypothesize that changes in fetal behavior seen after application of low frequency vibratory stimulus are more physiologic than the profound changes in fetal heart rate and gross fetal body movement previously described after vibratory acoustic stimulation with an electronic artificial larynx.","1989-12","2019-02-14 12:28:07","2019-02-14 12:28:07","","1470-1476","","6","161","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Human; Fetal Movement -- Evaluation; Heart Rate, Fetal -- Evaluation; Ultrasonics -- Utilization; Vibration -- Evaluation -- In Utero; Acoustic Stimulation -- Evaluation -- In Utero; Behavior -- Evaluation -- In Utero; Eye Movements -- Evaluation -- In Utero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[Author correction added on 16 June 2014, after first online publication: Results mentioned in the abstract were amended.] Non-snoring women with hypertensive disorders typically had mild obstructive sleep apnoea, but >25% of snoring women with hypertensive disorders had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Among women with hypertensive disorders, the mean apnoea/hypopnoea index was substantially higher in snorers than in non-snorers (19.9±34.1 versus 3.4±3.1, P=0.013), and the oxyhaemoglobin saturation nadir was significantly lower (86.4±6.6 versus 90.2±3.5, P=0.021). Among women with hypertensive disorders, after stratification by obesity, the pooled relative risk for obstructive sleep apnoea in snoring women with hypertension compared with non-snoring women with hypertension was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.8).Conclusions: Pregnant women with hypertension are at high risk for unrecognised obstructive sleep apnoea. Although longitudinal and intervention studies are urgently needed, given the known relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension in the general population, it would seem pertinent that hypertensive pregnant women who snore should be tested for obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition believed to cause or promote hypertension.","2014-12","2019-02-14 12:28:08","2019-02-14 12:28:08","","1685-1693","","13","121","","BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Polysomnography; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Diagnosis; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Snoring -- Epidemiology; Severity of Illness Indices; Hypertension -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Epidemiology; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted seven focus groups with 96 low-income overweight and obese pregnant women. Common themes were identified from audio tapes and transcripts. Women said that poor communication affected their relationships with spouses or significant others. They were frustrated or upset with significant others for three key reasons: failure to understand or listen to the pregnant women's pregnancy concerns, refusal to be helpful when asked and being overly concerned with the woman's safety. Most women said that they were emotional and took naps throughout the day after becoming pregnant. Many withdrew from their social interactions. They also faced numerous challenges that made healthy eating more difficult, e.g., craving for unhealthy foods and eating foods for comfort. To eat healthier, some reminded themselves to avoid overeating or stop eating in the car. Women were not physically active because of tiredness, lack of motivation, inadequate social support, or bad weather. Some stayed physically active to prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain and have an easier labor. Women equivocally said weighing themselves to manage weight would add to their stress and make them feel more depressed. When designing interventions to help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women avoid excessive pregnancy weight gain, it is important to include information and practical advice on stress management, emphasizing effective communication skills with significant others and helping them plan effective ways to manage negative feelings.","2015-05","2019-02-14 12:28:08","2019-02-14 12:28:08","","1060-1070","","5","19","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Physical Activity; Health Behavior; Diet; Audiorecording; Socioeconomic Factors; Support, Psychosocial; Focus Groups; Thematic Analysis; Motivation; Control (Psychology); Food Assistance; Michigan; Obesity -- Prevention and Control -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within these interactions the endocrine, nervous and immune systems are involved, microbiota being a part of the last one. Nowadays, gut microbiota has been shown to play an essential role, not only in the gastrointestinal tract but also into the nervous system, because of its bilateral connection. There are several methods to study Immunonutrition, which allow measuring different immunological biomarkers to provide information about the nutritional status. However, it should be taken into account that there is not a single gold standard parameter to evaluate the cause- effect relationship between nutrition and the immune system. On the contrary, a combination of biomarkers have to be assessed depending on the different nutritional situations. Since Immunonutrition is a multidisciplinary matter as mentioned above, the study on the interactions between nutrition and the immune system has not been exclusively focused as such, but bearing in mind other systems of the organisms as well as a wide range of confounding factors and determinants coming from idiosyncratic features, genes and lifestyle of each individual. Therefore, Immunonutrition allows to study the following research fields: 1) Evaluation of nutritional status in presumably healthy people with risk of malnutrition (children, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, elderly, and sportspeople); 2) Assessment of the evolution and progress of patients with nutrition and immune-related diseases, such as food allergies, eating and metabolic disorders; 3) Evaluation of the effects of nutrients, bioactive compounds and both conventional and functional foods on the immune system; 4) Evaluation of impact of lifestyle determinants on the immune system, such as diet, food behaviour, physical activity, sedentariness, sleep quality and quantity, and as a key factor, stress.","2015-01-04","2019-02-14 12:28:09","2019-02-14 12:28:09","","145-154","","","31","","Nutricion Hospitalaria","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A growing body of research has emphasized the importance of the timing of parent's incarceration on developmental outcomes. Study design The present study uses case–control matching to examine the impact of recent PI on newborn health and home safety outcomes. Methods Neonatal health and newborn sleep and home safety data, including rates of premature birth, low birth weight (LBW), neonatal intensive care unit admittance, breastfeeding initiation, safe sleep, and home environment (e.g. working smoke alarm, proper firearm storage), were collected from 108 women who completed the Virginia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring survey. Half of these women (n = 54) had experienced the incarceration of themselves or their partner during the previous 12 months. Participants were matched by age, race, income, and the education level with those of 54 women who completed the survey and who had not experienced incarceration in the previous year. Results Controlling for nicotine and alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other stressors, path analyses show that the women who experienced incarceration of themselves or their husband/partner were significantly less likely to deliver an LBW infant and more likely to live in a home with a loaded firearm in the home. No other significant differences emerged between the two matched groups among neonatal health or newborn sleep and home safety outcomes. Conclusions This result is considered from a public health perspective, as PI is an ACE which can be impacted by policy, particularly policies that promote practices that healthcare workers can use in correctional and other environments to encourage healthy pregnancies and home environments for newborns. Highlights • Parental incarceration is an adverse childhood experience that may impact newborn's health. • Parental incarceration was associated with higher rates of unsafe firearm storage. • Case–control matching revealed the impact of parental incarceration on newborn outcomes.","2018-12","2019-02-14 12:28:25","2019-02-14 12:28:25","","82-87","","","165","","Public Health (Elsevier)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Alcohol Drinking -- In Pregnancy; Human; Age Factors; Educational Status; Surveys; Delivery, Obstetric; Infant Care; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Health Promotion; Breast Feeding; Income; Childbirth, Premature; Risk Assessment; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Race Factors; Home Environment; Stress, Psychological; Spouses; Public Health; Medical Practice; Parental Behavior; Path Analysis; Firearms; Health Policy; Home Safety; Nicotine -- In Pregnancy; Prisoners; Virginia; Women -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Certified Safe Sleep Instructors (n = 35) were trained on how to plan and host a Community Baby Shower to provide education to pregnant women of low socioeconomic status or with high risk of infant mortality. Eighteen Community Baby Showers were held across two urban and eight rural counties in Kansas. Surveys were administered pre- and post-event to assess participant knowledge, confidence and intentions to follow through with planned action related to safe sleep, breastfeeding and reducing tobacco risk. Matched data were summarized and evaluated for differences using McNemar's and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. Significant increases were observed in Baby Shower participants' (n = 845) reported plans to follow the AAP Safe Sleep guidelines (all p < 0.001), likelihood to breastfeed (p < 0.001), confidence in ability to breastfeed for more than 6 months (p < 0.001), knowledge of local breastfeeding support resources (p < 0.001), knowledge of ways to avoid second-hand smoke exposure (p < 0.001) and knowledge of local tobacco cessation services (p = 0.004).

We recruited women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or greater, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, prior preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index of 5 or greater and further grouped into severity categories: mild SDB (5-14.9), moderate SDB (15-29.9), and severe SDB (≥30). Pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, infant weight) were abstracted by physicians blinded to the SDB results.Results: Of the 188 women with a valid early pregnancy sleep study, 182 had complete delivery records. There was no relationship demonstrated between SDB exposure in early or late pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, and small-for-gestational-age (<5%), or large-for-gestational-age (>95%) neonates. Conversely, SDB severity in early pregnancy was associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes (no SDB, 25%; mild SDB, 43%; moderate/severe SDB, 63%; P = .03). The adjusted odds ratio for developing gestational diabetes for moderate/severe SDB was 3.6 (0.6, 21.8).Conclusion: This study suggests a dose-dependent relationship between SDB in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational diabetes. In contrast, no relationships between SDB during pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth, and extremes of birthweight were demonstrated.","2014-06","2019-02-14 12:28:27","2019-02-14 12:28:27","","559.e1-6","","6","210","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; Human; Polysomnography; Infant, Newborn; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Epidemiology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Complications; Severity of Illness Indices; Birth Weight; Pre-Eclampsia -- Epidemiology; Childbirth, Premature -- Epidemiology; Childbirth, Premature -- Etiology; Pre-Eclampsia -- Etiology; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of our study was to determine whether early signs of cranial flattening could be detected in healthy neonates and to document incidence and potential risk factors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed in healthy newborns. Physical findings, anthropometric cranial measurements, and data on pregnancy and birth were recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of localized cranial flattening in singletons was 13%; other anomalous head shapes were found in 11% of single-born neonates. In twins, localized flat areas were much more frequent with an incidence of 56%. The following risk factors for cranial deformation were identified: assisted vaginal delivery, prolonged labor, unusual birth position, primiparity, and male gender. CONCLUSION: We propose that localized lateral or occipital cranial flattening at birth is a precursor to posterior deformational plagiocephaly. The infant lies supine, with the head turned to the flattened area, and is unable to roll. Intrauterine risk factors for localized cranial flattening are the same as for deformational plagiocephaly. To avoid postnatal progression from a localized cranial flattening to posterior-lateral deformational plagiocephaly, we suggest amending the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics on sleep position: Alternate the head position and allow sleeping on the side and, when awake, supervise prone time.

The STOP-BANG's sensitivity/specificity/+LR (cut-off=3) was 96%/19%/1.2, respectively whereas the STOP-BANG-Apple questionnaire (cut-off=4) was 90%/39%/1.5. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of STOP-Apple was comparable to the STOP-BANG (P=0.25). The addition of the apple body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire in participants with a score≥3 led to increased specificity (67.4%), increased the odds ratio of having OSA of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2-5.3) and odds ratio of having moderate-severe OSA of 4.7 (95% CI, 2.5-8.7).Conclusion: In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA.","2017-09","2019-02-14 12:28:28","2019-02-14 12:28:28","","126-131","","","41","","Journal of Clinical Anesthesia","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Body Mass Index; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Polysomnography; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Diagnosis; Funding Source; Male; Middle Age; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Severity of Illness Indices; Validation Studies; Obesity -- Complications; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Etiology; ROC Curve; Body Constitution; Health Screening -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of school-aged children in an urban, community-based cohort, stratified for term or preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) birth status. A total of 829 children, 8 to 11 years old (50% female, 46% black, 46% former preterm birth) were recruited from a cohort study. All children had unattended in-home overnight cardiorespiratory recordings of airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and heart rate for measurement of the apnea hypopnea index (number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas per hour). SDB was defined by either parent-reported habitual snoring or objectively measured OSA. Functional outcomes were assessed with 2 well-validated parent ratings of behavior problems: the Child Behavioral Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised:Long. RESULTS: Forty (5%) children were classified as having OSA (median apnea hypopnea index: 7.1 per hour; interquartile range: 3.1-10.5), 122 (15%) had primary snoring without OSA, and the remaining 667 (80%) had neither snoring nor OSA. Children with SDB had significantly higher odds of elevated problem scores in the following domains: externalizing, hyperactive, emotional lability, oppositional, aggressive, internalizing, somatic complaints, and social problems. CONCLUSIONS: Children with relatively mild SDB, ranging from primary snoring to OSA, have a higher prevalence of problem behaviors, with the strongest, most consistent associations for externalizing, hyperactive-type behaviors.","2004-12","2019-02-14 12:28:29","2019-02-14 12:28:29","","1640-1648","","6","114","","Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Child; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Human; Funding Source; Male; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Scales; T-Tests; Confidence Intervals; Sensitivity and Specificity; Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder -- Etiology; Child Behavior Checklist; Child Behavior Disorders -- Etiology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Psychosocial Factors; Snoring -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of our study was to uncover possible circadian rhythms of VCAM-1 plasma levels and urinary VCAM-1 excretion in uncomplicated and hypertensive pregnancies and to ascertain their relation to blood pressure. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 10 normotensive and 10 preeclamptic pregnant women were included in this study. Venous blood was collected hourly, and urine samples were taken every 2 h over a period of 24 h. VCAM-1 levels were determined by ELISA. We compared these results with the circadian blood pressure rhythm. RESULTS: The median VCAM-1 plasma levels were significantly (P < 0.01) increased in preeclamptic patients (851.5 ng/mL) in comparison to normotensive pregnant women (659.3 ng/mL) without any circadian rhythm being apparent; however, the urinary excretion of VCAM-1 showed a typical circadian rhythm, with a higher excretion rate during daytime. CONCLUSION: For the first time we have demonstrated that urinary VCAM-1 excretion in pregnancy shows a circadian rhythm without correlation to plasma levels or the circadian blood pressure rhythm. In contrast, VCAM-1 serum levels did not show a diurnal rhythm. We assume that VCAM-1 serum levels do not correlate with systemic blood pressure or urinary excretion.","2005-03","2019-02-14 12:28:29","2019-02-14 12:28:29","","144-148","","2","33","","Journal of Perinatal Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Time Factors; Gestational Age; Mann-Whitney U Test; Blood Pressure; Circadian Rhythm; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Interleukins; Membrane Proteins; Membrane Proteins -- Analysis; Membrane Proteins -- Blood; Membrane Proteins -- Urine; Pre-Eclampsia -- Physiopathology; Tumor Necrosis Factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Verbal recall memory performance was assessed in 254 women four times during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The relation between parity and memory function was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: The data indicate that the previously documented adverse effects of pregnancy on memory performance are compounded with successive pregnancies. During gestation and postpartum, multiparity was associated with poorer memory function, and these effects did not appear to be due to differences in maternal demographics, depressive symptoms, or sleep quality. Conclusions: Animal models demonstrate that the effects of reproduction on brain structure and function are both cumulative and enduring. However, little is known about the influence of reproductive experience on the human female brain. These findings provide evidence that in humans, reproduction is associated with striking and perhaps persisting changes in cognitive function.","2012-10","2019-02-14 12:28:30","2019-02-14 12:28:30","","1038-1045","","10","21","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","California; Female; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Human; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Analysis of Covariance; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Scales; Postnatal Period; Women's Health; Parity; Bivariate Statistics; Memory -- Evaluation; Memory Disorders -- Risk Factors -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because this policy is contrary to recent national recommendations that discourage any bed sharing, we examined 13 years of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred while bed sharing to assess the contribution of known risk factors. METHODS: We examined vital records, medical records, autopsy reports, and first responder reports for 93% of Alaskan infant deaths that occurred between 1992 and 2004. We examined deaths while bed sharing for risk factors including sleeping with a non-caregiver, prone position, maternal tobacco use, impairment of a bed-sharing partner, and an unsafe sleep surface. We used Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data to describe bed-sharing practices among all live births in Alaska during 1996-2003. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (n=126) of deaths occurred while bed sharing; 99% of these had at least one associated risk factor, including maternal tobacco use (75%) and sleeping with an impaired person (43%). Frequent bed sharing was reported for 38% of Alaskan infants. Among these, 60% of mothers reported no risk factors; the remaining 40% reported substance use, smoking, high levels of alcohol use, or most often placing their infant prone for sleeping. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all bed-sharing deaths occurred in association with other risk factors despite the finding that most women reporting frequent bed sharing had no risk factors; this suggests that bed sharing alone does not increase the risk of infant death.","2009-08-07","2019-02-14 12:28:31","2019-02-14 12:28:31","","527-534","","4","124","","Public Health Reports","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Infant; Human; Funding Source; Retrospective Design; Mothers; Bed Sharing; Prone Position; Smoking; Alaska; Infant Death -- Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently antenatal depression has been associated with shorter sleep duration, higher number of awakenings and sleep problems in infants. Examining the effect of treatment of depression on child development is the next step in unravelling the complex association between antenatal depression and offspring development.Methods: We used data from a pilot RCT of women with antenatal depression who received either Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), to examine infant sleep duration and temperament two months postpartum. Data was available for n=14 in the CBT group and n=11 in the TAU group.Results: No differences by treatment arm were evident. Improvement in depression scores during pregnancy was associated with easier temperament (β=-.45, p=.024) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration (β=-.58, p=.003). The findings were more pronounced in the CBT group compared to the TAU group.Limitations: This was a pilot RCT and as such the sample size was small and there was some loss to follow up between the baseline and postnatal assessment.Conclusion: Improvement in antenatal depressive symptoms may have beneficial effects for the infant; whether these are directly through effects on foetal development or indirectly through changes in the postnatal mother-infant relationship remains to be determined.","2015-12","2019-02-14 12:28:32","2019-02-14 12:28:32","","252-256","","","188","","Journal of Affective Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Infant; Human; Treatment Outcomes; Male; Comparative Studies; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Randomized Controlled Trials; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Validation Studies; Depression -- Therapy; Infant Behavior; Pilot Studies; Temperament; Cognitive Therapy; Psychotherapy, Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explores obstetric physicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and infant safe sleep and identifies barriers as well as enabling and/or reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with obstetric physicians who provide prenatal healthcare to women in Ohio. Surveys were sent to all licensed physicians included in the registry of the State Medical Board of Ohio with “obstetrics,” “obstetrics and gynecology,” or “maternal and fetal medicine” as their primary specialty (n = 1771). The response rate was 30%, with 418 physicians included in the analysis. Many participants were knowledgeable about infant safe sleep recommendations; however, only 55% indicated that it was important for obstetric physicians to discuss Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and/or infant safe sleep with prenatal patients. Many participants (70%) perceived barriers to providing infant safe sleep education, however most (82%) indicated interest in doing so. Participants’ knowledge and attitudes were significant predictors of whether they discuss this topic with patients. Obstetric physicians can influence the infant safe sleep decisions that women make. Improving obstetricians’ knowledge and attitudes about infant safe sleep and supporting physicians who wish to provide education on this topic may help to ensure that women are receiving frequent and consistent infant safe sleep messaging throughout the prenatal period.","2018-06","2019-02-14 12:28:32","2019-02-14 12:28:32","","488-495","","3","43","","Journal of Community Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Cross Sectional Studies; Sudden Infant Death -- Prevention and Control; Infant; Human; Surveys; Physicians; Behavior; Knowledge; Attitude; Obstetrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-four-hour sleep-wake diaries collected from 37 mother-infant dyads in the home environment were summarized to describe total, longest, and mean sleep period; synchrony of maternal and infant sleep; and feeding frequency and duration. Regression and post hoc analysis of variance were used to examine factors contributing to maternal and infant sleep. Maternal sleep is driven by infant sleep and feeding pattern. The minimum and maximum numbers of infant sleep episodes per day were 6 and 15, respectively, and mean infant total sleep was 13.47 hours (SD 1.73). Mean maternal total sleep was 7.18 hours (SD 1.51), with half of the mothers reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per 24 hours. Mean number of infant feedings was 11.14 (SD 3.27), with 11 infants (29.7%) receiving 13 or more feedings per 24 hours; minimum and maximum times per feeding were 15 and 41.7 minutes, respectively. Male infants had more sleep episodes, shorter sleep periods, and less sleep than females, and these gender differences resulted in shorter and more fragmented sleep for mothers.

Participants were 30 women (age ± SD = 28.3 ± 5.1 years) with a history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) who completed daily sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs to estimate sleep, and had their mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) during four separate weeks of the perinatal period (33 weeks pregnancy and weeks 2, 6, and 16 postpartum). They logged their infants' sleep and feeding behaviors daily and reported postnatal stress on the Childcare Stress Inventory (CSI) at week 16. Mothers' actigraphically estimated sleep showed associations with infant sleep and feeding patterns only at postpartum week 2. Shorter duration of the longest infant-sleep bout was associated with shorter maternal sleep duration ( p = .02) and lower sleep efficiency ( p = .04), and maternal sleep efficiency was negatively associated with the number of infant-sleep bouts ( p = .008) and duration of infant feeding ( p = .008). Neither infant sleep nor feeding was associated with maternal sleep at 6 or 16 weeks, but more disturbed infant sleep and more frequent feeding at 6 weeks were associated with higher HAM-D scores at 6 and 16 weeks and higher CSI scores. Sleep in the mother-infant dyad is most tightly linked in the early postpartum weeks, but mothers continue to experience disturbed sleep and infant sleep and feeding behaviors continue to be associated with mothers' depressive symptoms and stress ratings as long as 16 weeks postpartum. These data imply that interventions designed to improve maternal sleep and postpartum mood should include both mothers and infants because improving infant sleep alone is not likely to improve maternal sleep, and poor infant sleep is linked to postpartum depression and stress.","2016-04","2019-02-14 12:28:34","2019-02-14 12:28:34","","209-218","","2","19","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Infant; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Scales; Confidence Intervals; Analysis of Variance; Diaries; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Post Hoc Analysis; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Stress, Psychological; Actigraphy; Depression, Postpartum -- Risk Factors; Sleep Deprivation; Infant Feeding Schedules; Rhode Island","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Southampton, UK. Participants: Acohort of women from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS), who were recruited between 20-34 years of age and followed through their subsequent pregnancies and beyond; a total of 874 mother-infant pairs were involved in the study. Measurements and Results: Preconceptional psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). When their infants were 6 and 12 months of age, mothers were asked to report the number of times babies woke on average between the hours of midnight and 06:00 each night during a 2-week period. Preconceptional psychological distress was a strong predictor of infant night waking at both 6 and 12 months of age, independent of the effects of postnatal depression, bedroom sharing, and other confounding factors. At 6 months, preconceptional distress was associated with a 23% increased risk of waking (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.44), and at 12 months with a 22% increased risk (PR 1.22, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.02-1.46).

Methods: Magazines were included in this study if they had an average female readership of >5 million, circulation of >900 000, and median age of female readers of 20 to 40 years. Twenty magazines met these criteria. An additional 8 magazines targeted toward expectant parents and parents of young children were included, for a total of 28 magazines.

Results: A total of 391 unique pictures from 34 magazine issues were included in the analysis. Only 57 pictures (64%) portraying sleeping infants not being held by an adult portrayed the infants in the supine position, and 14.8% of sleeping infants were portrayed as sleeping with another person. Only 36 pictures (36.4%) of infant sleep environments portrayed a safe sleep environment, as recommended by the AAP. Conclusions: More than one third of pictures of sleeping infants in magazines geared toward childbearing women demonstrated infants in an inappropriate sleep position, and two thirds of pictures of infant sleep environments were not consistent with AAP recommendations. Messages in the media that are inconsistent with health care messages create confusion and misinformation about infant sleep safety and may lead inadvertently to unsafe practices.","2009-09","2019-02-14 12:28:35","2019-02-14 12:28:35","","e416-22","","3","124","","Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Sudden Infant Death -- Prevention and Control; Infant; Adult; Human; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Content Analysis; Home Environment; Supine Position; Photography; Serial Publications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using survey data for the 1996-1998 birth cohorts, this epidemiologic study examines infant sleep position in a large, population-based sample. DATA AND METHODS: Data concerning infant sleep position are drawn from the 1996-1998 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for 15 states. Weighted multiple logistic regression analysis is used to examine correlates of infant sleep position. RESULTS: The prevalence of prone infant sleeping significantly declined between 1996 and 1998 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.63, 0.78]). African Americans were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone, (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.33,1.59), and were less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.57). Hispanic/Latinos were less likely overall than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.95), but were also less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.87). Adherence to sleep position recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics increased sharply among Hispanic/Latino infants. Very low birth weight infants and infants in larger families were less likely to sleep in the recommended supine position. Infants born between 1001 and 1500 g (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.79), and extremely low birth weight infants between 500 and 1000 g (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.72) were especially unlikely to sleep supine. Infants in households with more than 3 other children (AOR = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.74) were more likely to sleep prone. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of supine infant sleep increased between 1996 and 1998.

Moreover, high maternal age (OR=0.86, 95%CI:0.75-0.98) was associated with a lower risk for excessive crying and being a single mother (OR=0.16, 95%CI:0.03-0.73) and cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions (OR: 0.59, 95%CI:0.36-0.96) was associated with a lower risk for sleeping problems.Conclusion: Excessive infant crying and feeding problems may be related to interactional deficits of anxious mothers who perceive their infants as ""difficult"" during soothing or feeding situations. Sleeping problems may be transmitted already during pregnancy by an altered sleep-wake-rhythm of mothers with a history of depression or by a genetic predisposition. Therapeutic interventions should focus on maternal anxiety and depression, behavior management techniques to cope with difficult situations with ""fussy"" infants and potential protective factors (e.g. favorable maternal emotion regulation) to address crying, feeding and sleeping problems.","2017-09","2019-02-14 12:28:36","2019-02-14 12:28:36","","23-31","","","112","","Early Human Development","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Crying; Child Development; Depression -- Epidemiology; Temperament; Anxiety -- Epidemiology; Sucking Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A prospective analysis of the children of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) controlled with diet and 19 GDM with insulin). Fetal abdominal circumference was evaluated ecographically during gestation. Skin temperature and rest-activity rhythms were monitored for 3 consecutive days in children at 15 days and 1, 3 and 6 months. Anthropometrical parameters of the children were evaluated during the first year of life. RESULTS: Children from the GDM groups tended to higher fetal abdominal circumference z-score than controls at the beginning of the last trimester (p = 0.077) and at delivery (p = 0.078). Mean skin temperature or activity was not different among the groups. The I < O sleep index pointed to increasing concordance with parental sleeping at 3 and 6 months but no significant GDM-dependent differences. However, some of the parameters that define temperature maturation and also the circadian function index from the temperature-activity variable were significantly lower at 6 months in the GDM + insulin group. Fetal abdominal circumference z-score, as a predictor of fetal adiposity, correlated negatively with parameters related to circadian rhythm maturation as the circadian/ultradian rhythm (P1 /Pult ratio). CONCLUSIONS: Fetal adiposity correlated with a worse circadian rhythm regulation in ODM. In addition, ODM insulin-treated showed a disturbed pattern of the circadian function index of temperature activity at 6 months of age.

By at least the third trimester of pregnancy fetal diurnal rhythms are entrainable by maternal day-night rhythms. Maternal illness during pregnancy and premature birth are obvious clinical factors that may adversely affect circadian rhythm development. Premature birth of the fetus has a most dramatic impact on maternal fetal interactions. The effect on biorhythms appears to be temporary and is greatest on the most immature infants. The results to date support the importance of fetal circadian rhythms and the relative lack of these rhythms in the preterm infant. It is well known that growth and development in the prematurely born infant are influenced by a multitude of factors; clearly, the neonatal intensive care unit is not a surrogate for the maternal placental unit. This article reviews what is known about circadian development in the human infant with an emphasis on the unique circumstances of the preterm infant. The research on the short- and long-term effects of environmental interventions on circadian, sleep, and neurologic development is discussed. Although an earlier onset of circadian development did not result with cycled lighting in the neonatal nursery, there may still be important biological effects that have not been studied. There are sufficient data to state that there is no reason for continuing a chaotic, noncircadian environmental approach for the care of the prematurely born infant. Copyright © 2000 by W.B.

A main effect of menstrual cycle existed on the rhythms of Bmal1, Cry1 and Per2 expression, but not Clock expression. No significant differences were detected between menstrual phase and late follicular phase in all clock genes. Significant differences were found on the expression of Bmal1, Cry1 or Per2 mRNA between late follicular phase and mid luteal phase, when no difference existed in estrogen level, indicating the role of progesterone on biological clock gene expression. Furthermore, the peak of Bmal1 mRNA level slightly advanced in mid luteal phase compared with that in menstrual and late follicular phases.Conclusion: The expression patterns of clock genes in PBMCs were influenced by menstrual cycle, potentially by the change of progesterone levels, and this effect maybe correlated with early pregnancy.","2015-03","2019-02-14 12:28:39","2019-02-14 12:28:39","","54-58","","","186","","European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology & Reproductive Biology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample will consist of 364 pregnant women, with a total universe of 6,579 births occurred in Granada (Spain) during 2014. The sample was divided into two groups, intervention group and control group. The activity will be carried out in the water sporting facilities of the Faculty of Sports Science of the University of Granada, which have two pools suitable for our purposes: a 25-meter polyvalent pool and a 12.5-meter pool for training.Results: The exercise program designed specifically for the project called SWEP is performed from 20 to 37 weeks of gestation (SG), and it consists of three weekly sessions, with duration of 60 minutes each. Sessions will include three phases: warm-up phase, the main phase in which the exercise is divided into an aerobic phase and strength training and endurance training phase and a final phase of stretching and relaxation. The variables that will be studied are: a) Maternal: weight, BMI, blood pressure, O’Sullivan test, postpartum depression, level of self-rated health, sleep quality and perceived exertion during physical activity; b) fetal: weight, Apgar scores, head circumference and GA (Gestational age); c) peripartum: time dilation, expulsion and delivery, type of delivery, episiotomy, type of feed received by the RN and time of exclusive breastfeeding; and d) descriptive: age, occupation, education level, type of exercise done before and OF (obstetric formula).Conclusion: With aquatic moderate physical activity during pregnancy (method SWEP), we intended to improve the variables above.","2016-01","2019-02-14 12:28:39","2019-02-14 12:28:39","","162-176","","1","33","","Nutricion Hospitalaria","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Questionnaires; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; Human; Infant, Newborn; Comparative Studies; Scales; Clinical Assessment Tools; Randomized Controlled Trials; Obesity; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Physical Endurance; Exercise; Weight Gain; Apgar Score; Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index; Pregnancy -- Physiology; Exercise of Self-Care Agency Scale; Physical Education and Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether this association is present when OSA is assessed objectively by polysomnography is not known.Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between pregnancy, OSA, and GDM.Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted observational case-control studies using polysomnography in 15 nonpregnant, nondiabetic women (NP-NGT), 15 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (P-NGT), and 15 pregnant women with GDM (P-GDM). The groups were frequency matched for age and race/ethnicity. Pregnant women were studied during the late second to early third trimester.Main Outcome Measures: Comparisons of OSA diagnosis and sleep parameters between NP-NGT and P-NGT to assess the impact of pregnancy and between P-NGT and P-GDM to explore the association between GDM and OSA were measured.Results: Compared with NP-NGT, P-NGT women had a higher apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (median 2.0 vs 0.5, P = .03) and more disrupted sleep as reflected by a higher wake time after sleep onset (median 66 vs 21 min, P < .01) and a higher microarousal index (median 16.4 vs 10.6, P = .01). Among the pregnant women, P-GDM had markedly lower total sleep time (median 397 vs 464 min, P = .02) and a higher AHI (median 8.2 vs 2.0, P = .05) than P-NGT women. OSA was more prevalent in P-GDM than in P-NGT women (73% vs 27%, P = .01). After adjustment for prepregnancy body mass index, the diagnosis of GDM was associated with a diagnosis of OSA [odds ratio 6.60 (95% confidence interval 1.15-37.96)]. In pregnancy, after adjusting for prepregnancy body mass index, higher microarousal index significantly associated with higher hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose levels. Higher oxygen desaturation index was associated with higher fasting glucose levels.Conclusion: Pregnancy is associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep is more disturbed in GDM than in P-NGT women.

Pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 July 2012), identified related studies and reviews from the Cochrane Back Review Group search strategy to July 2012, and checked reference lists from identified reviews and studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic or back pain in pregnancy. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Quality of the evidence for outcomes was assessed using the five criteria outlined by the GRADE Working Group. We included 26 randomised trials examining 4093 pregnant women in this updated review. Eleven trials examined LBP (N = 1312), four examined pelvic pain (N = 661), and 11 trials examined lumbo-pelvic (LBP and pelvic) pain (N = 2120). Diagnoses ranged from self-reported symptoms to the results of specific tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and unless noted, were compared to usual prenatal care. For LBP, there was low-quality evidence that in general, the addition of exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to -0.53; six RCTs, N = 543), and disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23; two RCTs, N = 146); and water-based exercise significantly reduced LBP-related sick leave (risk ratio (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92; one RCT, N = 241). Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested no significant difference in pain or function between two types of pelvic support belt, between osteopathic manipulation (OMT) and usual care or sham ultrasound (sham US). Very low-quality evidence suggested that a specially-designed pillow may relieve night pain better than a regular pillow. For pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that acupuncture significantly reduced evening pain better than exercise; both were better than usual care. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that adding a rigid belt to exercise improved average pain but not function; acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture for improving evening pain and function, but not average pain; and evening pain relief was the same following either deep or superficial acupuncture. For lumbo-pelvic pain, there was moderate-quality evidence that an eight- to 20-week exercise program reduced the risk of women reporting lumbo-pelvic pain (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; four RCTs, N = 1344); but a 16- to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual care at preventing pelvic pain (one RCT, N = 257). Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced lumbo-pelvic-related sick leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, two RCTs, N = 1062), and improved function. Low-quality evidence from single trials suggested that OMT significantly reduced pain and improved function; either a multi-modal intervention that included manual therapy, exercise and education (MOM) or usual care significantly reduced disability, but only MOM improved pain and physical function; acupuncture improved pain and function more than usual care or physiotherapy; pain and function improved more when acupuncture was started at 26- rather than 20- weeks' gestation; and auricular (ear) acupuncture significantly improved these outcomes more than sham acupuncture.When reported, adverse events were minor and transient. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the stage of pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbo-pelvic pain more than usual care alone, acupuncture was significantly more effective than exercise for reducing evening pelvic pain, and a 16- to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual prenatal care at preventing pelvic or LBP. Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from LBP.There was low-quality evidence from single trials for other outcomes because of high risk of bias and sparse data; clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out.Physiotherapy, OMT, acupuncture, a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more than usual care alone. Acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy at relieving evening lumbo-pelvic pain and disability and improving pain and function when it was started at 26- rather than 20-weeks' gestation, although the effects were small.There was no significant difference in LBP and function for different support belts, exercise, neuro emotional technique or spinal manipulation (SMT), or in evening pelvic pain between deep and superficial acupuncture.Very low-quality evidence suggested a specially-designed pillow may reduce night-time LBP.Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates. Future research would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to presenting symptoms.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]","2013-08","2019-02-14 12:28:42","2019-02-14 12:28:42","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","8","","","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Human; Treatment Outcomes; Clinical Trials; Confidence Intervals; Acupuncture -- In Pregnancy; Aquatic Exercises -- In Pregnancy; Back Pain -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Pelvic Pain -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Pillows and Cushions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study aimed at exploring the impact of intimate partner violence on antenatal care service utilisation in southern Terai of Nepal. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was performed in 6 village development committees in Dhanusha district, Nepal. A total of 426 pregnant women in their second trimester were selected using a multistage cluster sampling method. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association between exposure to intimate partner violence and selected antenatal care services, adjusting for covariates. Results Among 426 pregnant women, almost three out of ten women (28.9%) were exposed to intimate partner violence at some point during their pregnancy. Pregnant women who were exposed to intimate partner violence were less likely to: register for antenatal care (OR 0.31; 95% CI (0.08–0.50)), take iron and folic acid (OR 0.55; 95% CI (0.12–0.90)), report dietary diversity (middle vs low: OR 0.34; 95% CI (0.11–0.58) and high vs low: OR 0.18; 95% CI (0.08–0.37)), have rest and sleep during day time (OR 0.47; 95% CI (0.61–0.58)), and attend mother’s group meetings (OR 0.29; 95% CI (0.10–0.83)). Conclusions Intimate partner violence during pregnancy is associated with low utilisation of antenatal care services. Therefore, effective strategies to prevent or reduce intimate partner violence during pregnancy is needed, which may lead to improved antenatal care service utilization in Nepal with healthier mothers and children’s outcome.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:28:42","2019-02-14 12:28:42","","96-102","","2","31","","Women & Birth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Confidence Intervals; Regression; Rural Population; Multivariate Analysis; Intimate Partner Violence -- In Pregnancy; Folic Acid -- Therapeutic Use -- In Pregnancy; Iron -- Therapeutic Use -- In Pregnancy; Nepal; Prenatal Care -- Utilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The long-term effects to the child of in-utero exposure to antihypertensive agents remains largely unknown.Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review published studies on adverse outcomes to the child associated with in-utero exposure to antihypertensive medications.Methods: OVID, Scopus, EBSCO Collections, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant publications published between January 1950 and October 2016 and a total of 688 potentially eligible studies were identified.Results: Following review, 47 primary studies were eligible for inclusion. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist was used to assess study quality. Five studies were of excellent quality; the remainder were either mediocre or poor. Increased risk of low birth weight, low size for gestational age, preterm birth, and congenital defects following in-utero exposure to all antihypertensive agents were identified. Two studies reported an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder following exposure to labetalol, and an increased risk of sleep disorders following exposure to methyldopa and clonidine.Conclusion: The current systematic review demonstrates a paucity of relevant published high-quality studies. A small number of studies suggest possible increased risk of adverse child health outcomes; however, most published studies have methodological weaknesses and/or lacked statistical power thus preventing any firm conclusions being drawn.","2017-11","2019-02-14 12:28:44","2019-02-14 12:28:44","","2123-2137","","11","35","","Journal of Hypertension","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Child; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Gestational Age; Systematic Review; Birth Weight; Childbirth, Premature -- Epidemiology; Antihypertensive Agents -- Adverse Effects; Antihypertensive Agents -- Therapeutic Use; Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; Labetalol -- Adverse Effects; Labetalol -- Therapeutic Use; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Drug Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only is poor sleep a commonly reported symptom in those with depression, some aspects of sleep have also been shown to predict the onset of depression. Despite sleep problems being a commonly reported occurrence throughout the perinatal period, the field of perinatal sleep research remains in its relative infancy. However, recent studies suggest that sleep disturbances during this time may increase the risk of developing postpartum depression. Currently, research in this area is limited by studies that have failed to control for depressive symptoms at baseline, relied upon subjective, often retrospective, measures of sleep, and have only measured symptoms of postpartum depression in the early postpartum period. Few studies have used polysomnography, considered the gold standard of sleep, and no studies to date have specifically compared the relationship between subjective and objective sleep. Therefore, the major aim of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the specific aspects of sleep that were most relevant to postpartum depression. In order to address this aim, studies were carried out to: explore the aspects of sleep most relevant to major depressive disorder; examine differences in sleep between pregnant and non-pregnant women; investigate the relationships between subjective and objective measures of sleep; explore longitudinal changes in sleep, fatigue and depression throughout the perinatal period, and finally; examine which aspects of sleep at which time-point were most relevant to the development of postpartum depression. .Overall this thesis found that women experience significant changes to their sleep throughout the perinatal period. While the sleep of third trimester women is considerably poorer than that of non-pregnant women (both objectively and subjectively), the most significant changes occur in the transition between late pregnancy and the early postpartum period. Furthermore, increased amounts of sleep and reports of difficulty falling asleep during late pregnancy predicted the development of postpartum depressive symptoms. This suggests that certain aspects of sleep during late pregnancy may serve as markers for women at risk of developing postpartum depression..","2013-01","2019-02-14 12:28:44","2019-02-14 12:28:44","","","N.PAG p","","","","","","","","","","Bournemouth University (United Kingdom)","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAIU611784","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Pregnancy; Human; Depression; Sleep Disorders -- Diagnosis; Fatigue; Sleep Disorders -- Epidemiology; Depression, Postpartum -- Diagnosis; Depression, Postpartum -- Epidemiology; Perinatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We retrieved the papers that fulfilled the research criteria, with particular attention to the second half of pregnancy, the period when most fetal surgery is performed.Results: Fetuses are awake about 10% of the total time in the last gestational weeks, and they can be aroused by external stimuli. ENIn have not an anesthetic effect at normal fetal values, but only when they areartificialy injected at high doses; their blood levels in the last trimester of average pregnancies are not dissimilar either in the fetus or in the mother.Conclusions: During the second half of the pregnancy, external stimuli can awake the fetuses, although they spend most of the time in sleeping state; the presence of ENIn is absolutely not enough to guarantee an effective anesthesia during surgery. Thus, direct fetal analgesia/anesthesia is mandatory, though further studies on its possible drawbacks are necessary.","2018-05","2019-02-14 12:28:46","2019-02-14 12:28:46","","1241-1245","","9","31","","Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Human; Gestational Age; Medline; Adenosine -- Blood; Adenosine -- Physiology; Analgesia -- Methods; Anesthesia -- Methods; Arousal; Fetal Blood; Nervous System -- Embryology; Pain -- Embryology; Pain -- Prevention and Control; Pain -- Therapy; Prostaglandins -- Blood; Prostaglandins -- Physiology; Steroids -- Blood; Steroids -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Certified LCs delivered 3 intervention sessions (late pregnancy and 1-wk and 4-mo postpartum). The 4-mo contact used educational resources focused on developmental readiness for complementary foods. Age when complementary foods were introduced was obtained from repeated interviews (monthly from 3- to 27-wk postpartum).Results: A total of 49.5% and 87.2% of infants received complementary foods before 5 and 6 mo of age, respectively. There was evidence of group differences in the number of infants introduced to complementary foods before 5 mo (P = 0.006), with those receiving support and resources (FAB and Combo groups combined; 55.6%) more likely to wait until at least 5 mo compared with controls (control and Sleep groups combined; 43.3%) (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.16). However, there was no evidence they were more likely to wait until 6 mo of age (P = 0.52).

Design A prospective, descriptive study based on the symptom management theory, the theory of integral nursing, and Lee's conceptual model of impaired sleep. Setting Flagstaff, Arizona (elevation 6910 ft.) February to July 2011. Sample Convenience sample of 50 nulliparous women who completed 35 gestational weeks of pregnancy. Methods Institutional Review Board and Committee on Human Research approvals were obtained, and all participants signed informed consent. Sleep booklets were completed during the last 5 weeks of pregnancy. Participants were contacted by phone 2 to 4 weeks postdelivery to collect birth information. Analyses included Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, hierarchical multiple regression to explore relationships between sleep and length of labor, and logistic regression to predict mode of delivery from sleep parameters. Results After controlling for infant birth weight (beta = .315, R2 change = 8.0%, p < .05), length of labor was associated with self-reported sleep onset latency (beta = .593, R2 change = 21.7%, p < .001). Together, infant birth weight, maternal weight, age, income, sleep onset latency, hours of sleep, sleep disturbance, and sleep quality accounted for 51.6% of the variance in length of labor. For each additional minute it took to fall asleep, length of labor increased by 12 minutes. In this sample, utilizing the same variables and covariates in a logistic regression, late pregnancy sleep parameters were not predictive of mode of delivery. Conclusion/Implications for Nursing Practice This is the first research conducted at moderate altitude focused on late pregnancy sleep to explore relationships with perinatal outcomes. Because greater sleep disturbance and sleep onset latency were related to poor quality of sleep, obstetric care providers should advise women in late pregnancy to practice healthy sleep hygiene measures.","2015-06-02","2019-02-14 12:28:49","2019-02-14 12:28:49","","S69-70","","","44","","JOGNN: Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Logistic Regression; Pregnancy Outcomes; Descriptive Research; Human; Expectant Mothers; Convenience Sample; Infant, Newborn; Self Report; Time Factors; Sleep Disorders; Delivery, Obstetric; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Socioeconomic Factors; Gestational Age; Birth Weight; Multiple Regression; P-Value; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Obstetric Care; Arizona; Nulliparas; Labor; Models, Theoretical; Altitude -- In Pregnancy; Daily Logs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the last 30 y in the United States, the prevalence of obesity among children has dramatically increased, sparing no age group. Obesity in childhood is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes and with other long-term adverse outcomes, including both physical and psychosocial consequences. By the preschool years, racial/ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence are already present, suggesting that disparities in childhood obesity prevalence have their origins in the earliest stages of life. Several risk factors during pregnancy are associated with increased risk of offspring obesity, including excessive maternal gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, smoking during pregnancy, antenatal depression, and biological stress. During infancy and early childhood, rapid infant weight gain, infant feeding practices, sleep duration, child's diet, physical activity, and sedentary practices are associated with the development of obesity. Studies have found substantial racial/ethnic differences in many of these early life risk factors for childhood obesity. It is possible that racial/ethnic differences in early life risk factors for obesity might contribute to the high prevalence of obesity among minority preschool-age children and beyond. Understanding these differences may help inform the design of clinical and public health interventions and policies to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity and eliminate disparities among racial/ethnic minority children.","2012-01","2019-02-14 12:28:50","2019-02-14 12:28:50","","73-82","","1","3","","Advances in Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Child; Infant; United States; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Health Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Pediatric Obesity -- Prevention and Control; Health Services Accessibility; Child, Preschool; Hispanics; Pediatric Obesity -- Ethnology; Pediatric Obesity -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: A postal survey was undertaken that represents the first of a 3-stage project designed to evaluate the health interventions of primary health care teams and continence advisory services on patient outcomes related to UI. Setting and Subjects: Two random samples of adult populations (N = 12,529) were included, generated from the family physician patient registers within 2 health authorities in England. Instruments: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that queried demography, perceived health status, activities of daily living, self-care, and use of local health and social services. Information was also collected on past and present continence status. Methods: Structured questionnaires and a cover letter were mailed to the target population. Two reminders were sent to nonresponders to maximize the response rate. Main Outcome Measures: The main measures relate to factors associated with UI: mobility, sleep, childbirth, smoking, diet, body mass index, and accommodation. Results: Significantly more women than men had UI (P < .0001). Respondents with UI were older than those who were continent (P < .0001). Women with UI were significantly more likely to have a greater number of pregnancies (P < .0001), were more likely to have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 lb (P < .01), and to have had more than 4 children (P = .01) compared with women who were continent. People with UI were less likely to be single and more likely to be widowed than those who were continent (P < .0001). People who lived alone and who had UI were also significantly less likely to have a relative or friend that they could depend on for help than those who were continent (P < .001). UI was also found to be significantly associated with impaired mobility (P < .0001) and sleeping difficulties (P < .0001). No meaningful differences were found between diet and UI, although significantly more people with UI had higher mean body mass index, were obese, or reported that they felt too heavy for their height when compared with people who were continent (P < .0001). No association was found in the present study with smoking or ethnicity and UI. Conclusions: Key health and lifestyle factors associated with UI included age, gender, childbirth, mobility, sleep patterns, obesity, living alone, and access to help. These factors should be assessed when planning and implementing health care for persons with UI. Attention to these associated factors may prove useful in identifying new cases or people at risk of developing UI when screening people as part of routine health checks. This, in turn, could assist with targeting effective and efficient health care but may also contribute to prevention for some people.","1999-11","2019-02-14 12:28:51","2019-02-14 12:28:51","","312-319","","6","26","","Journal of Wound, Ostomy & Continence Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Body Mass Index; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Male; Middle Age; Chi Square Test; Power Analysis; Risk Factors; Mail; Confidence Intervals; Health Status; Aged; Childbirth; Mann-Whitney U Test; Life Style; Survey Research; Sex Factors; England; Physical Mobility; Urinary Incontinence","","Palmer MH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study also examined whether couples seeking fertility treatments present lifestyle-related factors that may interfere with their reproductive health. Materials and Methods: This prospective pilot study was conducted in a fertility clinic between May 2015 and February 2016. Feasibility factors evaluated were recruitment rates, compliance with the protocol, retention rate and ART outcomes at six-month follow-up. Anthropometric profile and lifestyle habits of both partners were evaluated before the beginning of infertility treatments. Results: We approached 130 eligible infertile couples. Among them, 32 (25%) agreed to participate and 28 (88%) complied with the protocol. At six-month follow-up, seven couples (25%) did not start, or stop, infertility treatments and 13 couples (62%) achieved a clinical pregnancy. Among the 28 couples included in the analyses, 16% of the partners were obese and 23% had abdominal obesity. The majority of the subjects were still drinking alcohol (84%). Sixty-eight percent of women needed improvement in their diet (vs. 95% of men, P=0.05) and none of them achieved the Canadian recommendations for physical activity (vs. 33% of men, P=0.001). Moreover, 35% of the partners had a poor sleep quality. Overall, women presented a worse reproductive health profile than men, with 3.1 and 2.4 out of seven adverse factors, respectively (P=0.04). Conclusion: Conducting a large prospective cohort study in our fertility clinic will be feasible but recruitment and compliance with the protocol need to be improved. Many women and men seeking fertility treatments present unfavourable lifestyle-related factors that may explain, at least partially, their difficulties in conceiving.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:28:52","2019-02-14 12:28:52","","19-26","","1","12","","International Journal of Fertility & Sterility","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Human; Physical Activity; Diet; Male; Infertility -- Therapy; Obesity; Sleep Hygiene; Life Style; Pilot Studies; Reproductive Health; After Care; Alcohol Abuse; Anthropometry; Family Characteristics; Reproduction Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This longitudinal study aimed to assess the synchronous and prospective bidirectional links between parental cry-tolerance, soothing, and infant sleep from pregnancy through six months postpartum.Methods: Sixty-five couples were recruited during pregnancy and assessed for cry-tolerance using a paradigm in which participants were shown a videotape of a crying infant and were asked to stop the video when they feel it is necessary to intervene. Infant sleep was assessed objectively using actigraphy for five nights at three and six months postpartum. Parental soothing techniques were reported by parents at both assessment points, and cry-tolerance was reassessed at six months.Results: Concomitant associations were found between maternal cry-tolerance and infant sleep at six months, indicating that lower maternal cry-tolerance was correlated with poorer actigraphic sleep quality. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modeling analyses yielded significant prospective associations, showing that lower cry-tolerance at pregnancy predicted better infant sleep at three months, whereas more disrupted sleep at three months predicted lower cry-tolerance at six months. Moreover, fathers showed higher cry-tolerance compared to mothers, and parents became more similar to each other across time in their reactivity to infant crying.Conclusion: Consistent with the transactional model of infant sleep, the findings of this study highlight the role of parental cry-tolerance in infant sleep development, and demonstrate bidirectional links between this construct and infant sleep throughout the first six months of life.","2018-10","2019-02-14 12:28:54","2019-02-14 12:28:54","","72-78","","","50","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The LOC reflects the extent to which a person is in control of her or his life events. METHODS: One hundred and two women who were regular smokers at the time of conception and paid their first visits to the antenatal clinic (ANC) on account of the current pregnancy participated. The study was quantitative and questionnaire based, covering background factors, smoking habits, and the LOC. One hundred of the women were met a second time after the delivery. Smoking habits were monitored by the content of carbon monoxide in expired air. The LOC was recorded on a VAS scale (0-10). A lower index was consistent with a more internal LOC and a higher with a more external LOC. RESULTS: The median LOC found was 4.0 (range 1.1-7.9). The LOC was not correlated to the CO in expired air. Younger age was linked to a more internal LOC, while worse sleep was correlated to a more external LOC (p<0.05). No differences were found between those who stopped smoking and those who did not. This was the case in both light and heavy smokers.

Thus, the interplay between these two problems across pregnancy is of interest. In addition, psychological resilience may explain individual differences in this association, as it may promote coping with both sleep disturbances and anxiety, and thereby reduce their mutual effects. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether sleep quality and sleep duration, and changes in sleep are associated with the level of and changes in anxiety during pregnancy. Furthermore, the study tested the moderating effect of resilience on these associations.Methods: At gestational weeks 14, 24, and 34, 532 pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland filled out questionnaires on general sleep quality, sleep duration and pregnancy-related anxiety; resilience was assessed in week 14.Results: Parallel process latent growth curve models showed that shorter initial sleep duration predicted a higher initial level of anxiety, and a higher initial anxiety level predicted a faster shortening of sleep duration. Changes in sleep duration and changes in anxiety over the course of pregnancy were not related. The predicted moderating effect of resilience was not found.Conclusions: The results suggested that pregnant women reporting anxiety problems should also be screened for sleeping problems, and vice versa, because women who experienced one of these pregnancy-related problems were also at risk of experiencing or developing the other problem.","2017-12","2019-02-14 12:28:54","2019-02-14 12:28:54","","63-68","","","40","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Human; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Data Analysis, Statistical; Hardiness; Anxiety -- Epidemiology; Anxiety -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 24 primiparous and 1 8 multiparous women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in fatigue and energy over time. Measures were obtained at follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle before pregnancy, at each trimester, and at 1 and 3 months after delivery. RESULTS: Younger age and lower prepregnancy levels of iron, ferritin, and hemoglobin explained 1st trimester fatigue. Less total sleep was related to fatigue in the 3rd trimester. Postpartum fatigue was related to reduced amounts of sleep and low levels of ferritin and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of premenstrual (luteal) fatigue, progesterone levels were unrelated to fatigue. Neither paid employment nor family variables influenced perception of fatigue.

The subjects were 57 mothers after 35 weeks of pregnancy who gave informed consent to participate. Of these, forty-seven mothers 1 month postpartum and thirty-four at 4 months postpartum, were surveyed longitudinally at.Participant recorded 24 hours sleep-and-wakefulness using a day-by-day plot method on Sleep Log at intervals of 30 minutes for one week.We calculated sleep parameters: total sleep time (TST), nocturnal sleep time (NST), diurnal sleep time (DST), longest sustained sleep period (LSP), LSP onset and offset times, numbers of total sleep hours and diurnal sleep hours, time of waking after sleep onset (WASO), number of WASO and sleep-wake cycle.ResultsTST were 7.79 hours in late pregnancy, 6.73 hours 1 month postpartum and 6.91 hours in 4 month after delivery (F=18.21, p<0.001). NST were 6.75 hours, 5.85 hours and 6.36 hours (F=12.27, p<0.001) respectively. LSP were 6.39 hours, 3.46 hours and 4.13 hours (F=87.61, p<0.001). TST, NST and LSP in postpartum were shorter than those late pregnancy. WASO were 0.42 hours, 1.70 hours and 1.14 hours (F=45.42, p<0.001). Number of WASO were 0.3 times, 1.7 times and 1.5 times (F=78.60, p<0.001). WASO in postpartum was longer than those late pregnancy, and number of WASO in postpartum was larger than those late pregnancy.It was found that LSP showed significant negative correlation with LSP onset in late pregnancy (r=-0.481, p<0.001), and 4 months postpartum (r=-0.396, p<0.05).In addition, LSP were predominantly between 0:22 and 6:50, while cycle of sleep-and-wakefulness rhythm was approximately 24 hours, which showed a range of 24.04 hours to 24.08 in the mothers in this study. ConclusionThe sleep-wakefulness rhythm in mothers is disturbed from late pregnancy to postpartum, although TSP, NSP, LSP decrease and WASO increases.

More than half of all pregnant women experience low back pain at some time during pregnancy. The pain can vary from a mild discomfort to being severe and disabling. In one-third of these women, pain is a severe problem compromising activities of daily living, work and sleep. The awareness of the possible impact of low back pain on the quality of life and the associated costs to society has increased medical attention over the last decade. Pain usually develops between the fifth and seventh month of pregnancy but may appear as early as the first trimester. Moreover, some women who experience back pain during pregnancy experience persistent back pain in the postpartum period or have an increased risk of back pain in subsequent pregnancies, and many women with chronic back pain link its onset to a pregnancy. Despite its high frequency, there are some ambiguities inherent in the terminology, diagnosis and classification. The etiology and pathogenesis are not yet clearly understood. The etiology of pain is probably related to a combination of mechanical, hormonal and vascular contributing factors. Low back pain in pregnancy is most commonly subdivided into lumbar pain and posterior pelvic pain. This subdivision is important in terms of both management and prognosis. Characteristic findings and treatment may differ between the two categories. Accurate assessment and effective treatment are important for managing the low back pain of pregnancy.","2009-03","2019-02-14 12:29:08","2019-02-14 12:29:08","","39-45","","1","24","","Turkish Journal of Rheumatology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pelvic Pain; Activities of Daily Living; Low Back Pain -- Diagnosis; Low Back Pain -- Etiology; Low Back Pain -- In Pregnancy; Low Back Pain -- Physiopathology; Low Back Pain -- Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design Prospective, longitudinal study. Participants One hundred seventy (170) pregnant women at 10-20 weeks gestation. Methods Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time, averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain. Results On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality ( M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income < $50,000/year was associated with poorer sleep quality (β = -.18, p < 0.05) and greater sleep fragmentation (β = -.18, p < 0.05) following covariate adjustment. Conclusions Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider.","2014-04-03","2019-02-14 12:29:09","2019-02-14 12:29:09","","160-167","","2","43","","JOGNN: Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Descriptive Research; Human; Polysomnography; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Scales; Educational Status; Blacks; Income; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Whites; Accelerometry; Multiple Linear Regression; Secondary Analysis; Research Subject Recruitment; Independent Variable; Socioeconomic Factors -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of lead on sensory function have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant sensory function, as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and grating visual acuity (VA).Methods: Lead was measured in maternal blood in mid- and late-pregnancy (mean gestational age = 15.5 and 39.0 weeks, respectively) and umbilical cord blood in a cohort of full-term infants in rural northeastern China. ABR latencies (peaks I, III, V) were measured in newborns during unsedated sleep (n = 315). The ABR central-to-peripheral (C-P) ratio was calculated as the ratio between the III-V and I-III interpeak intervals. VA was measured in 6-week-olds using Teller Acuity Cards (n = 1019) and assigned as the narrowest grid the infant fixated on. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between tertiles of mid-pregnancy, late-pregnancy, or cord lead and newborn ABR or 6-week VA.Results: Higher late-pregnancy lead levels were associated with higher ABR C-P ratios and lower VA. In covariate-adjusted analyses, mean C-P ratios were 4.6 and 3.2 % higher in infants whose mothers had lead > 3.8 μg/dL and lead = 2-3.8 μg/dL, respectively, than for infants whose mothers had lead < 2 μg/dL (p-trend =0.002). In adjusted analyses for VA, mean scores were 8.5 and 7.2 % lower for maternal lead > 3.8 μg/dL and lead = 2-3.8 μg/dL, respectively, compared to lead < 2 μg/dL (p-trend =0.009).Conclusion: Auditory and visual systems maturation appears delayed in infants with higher prenatal lead exposure during late-pregnancy, even at relatively low levels. Both systems start myelinating in late gestation and mature rapidly in infancy. Higher ABR C-P ratio and lower grating VA scores suggest effects of low-level lead exposure on sensory system myelination.","2016-06-07","2019-02-14 12:29:10","2019-02-14 12:29:10","","1-10","","","15","","Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Infant; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Male; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Maternal Exposure; Fetal Blood; Environmental Pollutants -- Blood; Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brainstem; Lead -- Blood; Sensation; Visual Acuity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Describing the relationship between early aEEG patterns and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can improve our knowledge of neurological injury in the preterm newborn. The aim of this prospective study was to identify early changes in the aEEG in premature newborns that could be associated to severe neurological lesion/death. Preterm newborns with a birth weight ≤1,500 g and/or 32 weeks of gestation were included. aEEG monitoring was performed during the first 72 h of life. A qualitative analysis of the aEEG recordings was performed, based on continuity, sleep-wake cycles (SWCs), inferior lower margin amplitude (LMA), and bandwidth (BW). Key outcomes were severe IVH and/or death. Ninety-two subjects were included (mean gestational age 28 weeks). In 28.6 % of subjects with HIV III/IHP, a low-voltage pattern was observed. A statistically significant relationship was found between low-voltage tracings and death and neurological lesion/death.

However, little is known about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms.Methods: This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum.Results: We found several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point - PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum - only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum.Limitations: Limitations of the study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia from PTSD symptoms.Conclusions: Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments.","2015-02","2019-02-14 12:29:11","2019-02-14 12:29:11","","146-152","","","172","","Journal of Affective Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Infant; Labor -- Psychosocial Factors; Adult; Human; Interpersonal Relations; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Scales; Self Report; Postnatal Period; Insomnia -- Psychosocial Factors; Personality; Impact of Events Scale; Conflict (Psychology); Confounding Variable; Life Change Events; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to assess these potential changes. Methods: Population-based data from home visits have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69 explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993 and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen ""reference"" sleep before interview have been used for comparison. Findings: Over the past 20 years, the proportion of children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone-rather than because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer are breastfed. Interpretation: Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families, and particularly, infant sleep environments.","2006-01-28","2019-02-14 12:29:11","2019-02-14 12:29:11","","314-319","","9507","367 North American Edition","","Lancet","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Fetus; Prospective Studies; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Infant; Human; United Kingdom; Infant, Newborn; Male; Chi Square Test; Socioeconomic Factors; Bed Sharing; Mann-Whitney U Test; Supine Position; Home Visits; Nonparametric Statistics; Single Parent; Smoking -- Epidemiology -- In Utero; Sudden Infant Death -- Epidemiology -- United Kingdom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reasons behind women's childbearing behaviour are complex. However, a lack of awareness regarding the consequences of delayed childbearing and the inability of reproductive technologies to overcome the 'biological clock' may be contributory factors. Objective A narrative review guided by the research question: What do women need to know about the consequences of delayed childbearing in order to make informed decisions about their fertility? Discussion There are three facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around their fertility: Some women want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone childbearing; there can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing and; some women's ideas about their fertility don't match the 'the scientific facts'. General practitioners are well placed to play a strategic role in the provision of timely, relevant information to help women make informed decisions about their fertility. Further research is needed to identify the most appropriate ways for GPs to communicate this information.","2012-05","2019-02-14 12:29:12","2019-02-14 12:29:12","","343-346","","5","41","","Australian Family Physician","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Human; Australia; Time Factors; Attitude to Health; Fertility; Reproduction; Patient Education; Decision Making; Family Practice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unknown whether intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA modifies male fertility. We tested the hypothesis that male fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA in a mouse model. DESIGN: Case-control comparison in a murine model. SETTING: University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen F1 (C57BL/6xCBA) male mice. INTERVENTIONS: Mice were subjected to a pattern of periodic hypoxia (20 sec at 5% O2 followed by 40 sec of room air) 6 h/day for 60 days or normoxia. After this period, mice performed a mating trial to determine effective fertility by assessing the number of pregnant females and fetuses. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: After euthanasia, oxidative stress in testes was assessed by measuring the expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sperm motility was determined by Integrated Semen Analysis System (ISAS). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased testicular oxidative stress, showing a reduction in the expression of Gpx1 and Sod1 by 38.9% and 34.4%, respectively, as compared with normoxia (P < 0.05). Progressive sperm motility was significantly reduced from 27.0 ± 6.4% in normoxia to 12.8 ± 1.8% in the intermittent hypoxia group (P = 0.04). The proportion of pregnant females and number of fetuses per mating was significantly lower in the intermittent hypoxia group (0.33 ± 0.10 and 2.45 ± 0.73, respectively) than in normoxic controls (0.72 ± 0.16 and 5.80 ± 1.24, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the intermittent hypoxia associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could induce fertility reduction in male patients with this sleep breathing disorder.

The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness. METHOD: An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated. RESULTS: The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.","2004-04","2019-02-14 12:29:15","2019-02-14 12:29:15","","608-620","","4","161","","American Journal of Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Infant; Adolescence; Adult; Postnatal Period; Prenatal Care; Breast Feeding; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Drug Therapy -- Adverse Effects -- In Utero; Anticonvulsants -- Adverse Effects; Antianxiety Agents, Benzodiazepine -- Adverse Effects; Antimanic Agents -- Adverse Effects; Antipsychotic Agents -- Adverse Effects; Bipolar Disorder -- Drug Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Carbamazepine -- Adverse Effects; Electroconvulsive Therapy; Fetal Development -- Drug Effects; Fetal Diseases -- Chemically Induced; Lithium Carbonate -- Adverse Effects; Valproic Acid -- Adverse Effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In early pregnancy there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies. In later gestation maternal metabolic manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, such as gestational hypertensive disorders and diabetes, become clinically recognized because of the increased insulin resistance in obese compared with nonobese women. In women with pregestational glucose intolerance, hypertension, central obesity, and lipid disorders, the physiologic changes in pregnancy increase the risk of problems previously not routinely encountered during pregnancy. These include chronic cardiac dysfunction, proteinuria, sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. At parturition the obese patient is at an increased risk of cesarean delivery and associated complications of anesthesia, wound disruption, infection, and deep venous thrombophlebitis. For the fetus there are short-term risks of fetal macrosomia, more specifically obesity, and long-term risks of adolescent components of the metabolic syndrome. Although preliminary results of bariatric surgery are encouraging, the procedure is expensive and not for all obese women, and we recognize that long-term follow-up data on offspring of obese women who have undergone bariatric surgery before pregnancy are lacking. In the interim, we need to encourage obese women to lose weight before conception, using lifestyle changes if possible. During pregnancy, weight gain should be limited to Institute of Medicine guidelines (currently under review) and encouragement given for physical activity.","2007-02","2019-02-14 12:29:15","2019-02-14 12:29:15","","419-433","","2 part 1","109","","Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications -- Therapy; Pregnancy Complications -- Etiology; Fetal Diseases -- Risk Factors; Obesity -- Complications; Childbirth, Premature -- Risk Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Metabolism; Fetal Macrosomia -- Risk Factors; Obesity -- Metabolism; Obesity -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Perinatal Death -- Risk Factors; Weight Gain -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis. RESULTS: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis.

Vulnerability to mood dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is typified by sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes triggered by sleep loss was associated with PP in women with bipolar disorder (BD).Methods: Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on whether mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of PP were compared between women who did and did not report mood episodes following sleep loss.Results: Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.47-2.97, p < 0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p = 0.526).Limitations: Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes.Conclusions: In clinical practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.","2018-01","2019-02-14 12:29:17","2019-02-14 12:29:17","","624-629","","","225","","Journal of Affective Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Labor -- Psychosocial Factors; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Causal Attribution; Postnatal Period -- Psychosocial Factors; Affect; Bipolar Disorder -- Psychosocial Factors; Puerperal Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hypoxia/hyperoxia variables were defined as percentage time of first 4 weeks of life that SaO(2) < 80% or SaO(2) > 98%, respectively. Parents completed part of the OSA-18 questionnaire for symptoms of SDB at 18-22 months.

The mean gestation was 26 weeks, and mean birth weight 887 grams. Loud snoring (21%) and restless sleep (24%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of loud snoring (OR, 2.7; CI, 1.13-6.5). Prolonged mechanical ventilation, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged caffeine use, however, were inversely correlated with loud snoring. Neither neonatal hypoxia nor hyperoxia were associated with sleep symptoms.Conclusions: While the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing symptoms is similar to reported rates, we found a sex difference not previously reported.

Our study aimed to determine whether maternal sleep deprivation occurring during the second and third trimester of pregnancy could alter fetal well-being with respect to birth weight and APGAR score by altering the inflammatory status and oxidative stress in the mothers. Method: Sleep adequacy was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We investigated the inflammatory status and oxidative stress at term in the blood of pregnant subjects with and without sleep deprivation by measuring the levels of protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO). Homocysteine (Hcy) and its vitamin determinants were also measured. Fetal outcome with respect to birth weight and APGAR score were compared between study subjects. Results: A significant increase was observed in the levels of hsCRP, PBSA, Hcy, MDA, and PCO, in the sleep-deprived group when compared to the control group. Fetal outcome at birth showed a significant difference between the cases with high sleep deprivation and those with low sleep deprivation. Conclusion: Sleep deprivation in pregnancy leads to an increase in the inflammatory parameters, oxidative stress, and Hcy levels. Fetal outcome at birth was affected more in mothers with high sleep deprivation than those with low sleep deprivation.

However, controversy remains regarding maternal and obstetrical risk factors for SIDS. In our study, we sought out to determine both modifiable and non-modifiable obstetrical and maternal risk factors associated with SIDS. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the CDC’s Linked Birth–Infant Death data from the United States for the year 2010. The impact of several obstetrical and maternal risk factors on the risk of overall infant mortality and SIDS was estimated using unconditional regression analysis, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results: Our cohort consisted of 4,007,105 deliveries and 24,174 infant deaths during the first year of life, of which 1991 (8.2%) were due to SIDS. Prominent risk factors for SIDS included (OR [95% CI]): black race, 1.89 [1.68–2.13]; maternal smoking, 3.56 [3.18–3.99]; maternal chronic hypertension, 1.73 [1.21–2.48]; gestational hypertension, 1.51 [1.23–1.87]; premature birth <37 weeks, 2.16 [1.82–2.55]; IUGR, 2.46 [2.14–2.82]; and being a twin, 1.81 [1.43–2.29],p < 0.0001. Relative to a cohort of infants who died of other causes, risk factors with a predilection for SIDS were maternal smoking, 2.48 [2.16–2.83] and being a twin, 1.52 [1.21–1.91],p < 0.0001. Conclusions for practice: While certain socio-demographic and gestational characteristics are important risk factors, maternal smoking remains the strongest prenatal modifiable risk factor for SIDS. We recommend the continuation of Public Health initiatives that promote safe infant sleeping practices and smoking cessation during and after pregnancy.","2017-10","2019-02-14 12:29:21","2019-02-14 12:29:21","","2315-2323","","19","30","","Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Infant; Adolescence; Adult; Human; United States; Young Adult; Male; Risk Factors; Retrospective Design; Sudden Infant Death -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress.Methods: The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night.Results: We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8% vs. 6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5% vs. 9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6-5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8-5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men.Conclusions: The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.","2017-01","2019-02-14 12:29:23","2019-02-14 12:29:23","","47-56","","","29","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sleep -- Physiology; Insomnia -- Epidemiology; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Finland; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Anxiety -- Psychosocial Factors; Sex Factors; Fathers -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this prospective longitudinal study, the specific associations of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to, during and after pregnancy and infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems were investigated in the context of maternal parity. Methods In the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n = 306 primiparous and multiparous women were repeatedly interviewed from early pregnancy until 16 months post partum with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V) to assess DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders. Information on excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems was obtained from n = 286 mothers during postpartum period via questionnaire and interview (Baby-DIPS). Results Findings from this study revealed syndrome-specific risk constellations for maternal anxiety and depressive disorders as early as prior to pregnancy: Excessive infant crying (10.1%) was specifically associated with maternal anxiety disorders, especially in infants of younger and lower educated first-time mothers. Feeding problems (36.4%) were predicted by maternal anxiety (and comorbid depressive) disorders in primiparous mothers and infants with lower birth weight. Infant sleeping problems (12.2%) were related to maternal depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders irrespective of maternal parity. Conclusions Primiparous mothers with anxiety disorders may be more prone to anxious misinterpretations of crying and feeding situations leading to an escalation of mother-infant interactions. The relation between maternal depressive and infant sleeping problems may be better explained by a transmission of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy or a lack of daily structure and bedtime routine with the infant. Maternal disorders prior to pregnancy require more attention in research and clinical practice.","2016-03","2019-02-14 12:29:23","2019-02-14 12:29:23","","231-245","","2","42","","Child: Care, Health & Development","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Germany; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Infant; Human; Depression; Funding Source; Male; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Confidence Intervals; Anxiety; Infant Feeding; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Infant Behavior; Interview Guides; Crying -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first paper describes the theoretical framework which guides both studies, the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing. The first paper also reviews the state of the science for the measurement of neonatal processing, neonatal neurobehavioral organization (NNBO). The second paper is the first study to describe breastfeeding behaviors, a measure of NNBO, of children later diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).The first study describes the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing theoretical framework, reviews the science of NNBO biobehavioral measures, and provides a short summary of a descriptive study using breastfeeding as an NNBO measure. The Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing uses three concepts, a neonate, the environment (maternal factors) and the neonatal mental system. Neonatal processing occurs within the neonatal mental system. The mental system may be assessed by NNBO biobehaviors, specifically breastfeeding. Breastfeeding and other NNBO biobehavioral measures of sleep/wake states, vagal tone and heart rate variability, neurophysiological measures of eventrelated potential of brain activity, and nutritive sucking and sucking patterns of bottle feeding literature is reviewed. NNBO biobehavioral measures have been found to be predictive of developmental outcomes. Breastfeeding, however, as an NNBO biobehavioral measure, has limited research as a predictive measure for cognitive and social outcomes. A short summary describes maternal breastfeeding experiences of mothers of children later diagnosed with ASD using the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing as a guide. Mothers described their breastfeeding experiences and their neonate's breastfeeding behaviors. Many of the neonates' breastfeeding behaviors were described as demonstrating an atypical breastfeeding pattern, 'insatiable feeding', which may reflect early alteration in processing.The second paper applies the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing in a retrospective study. The study describes the maternal breastfeeding experiences during the first month after delivery of mothers who breastfed children later diagnosed with ASD. Mothers were interviewed in their homes, offices, libraries, at local shopping malls and restaurants. The interview used three measures created from the three major concepts within the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing: a maternal socio-environmental questionnaire, a semi-structured interview, and a post-interview summary.Participants were a convenience sample of 20 mothers (13 primiparas, 7 multiparas). Maternal age range was 28--60 years of age (M = 43.3, SD = 9.6). Two mothers had more than one son diagnosed with ASD. One mother had two sons and the second mother had three sons diagnosed with ASD for a total sample of 23 breastfed neonates. All 23 children had been full term neonates (38--42 weeks gestation) with birth weight > 2500 grams, diagnosed with ASD between ages of 18 months to 11 years of age (M = 4.3, SD = 2.4) and age range at the time of the maternal interview was 5--35 years of age (M = 11.5, SD = 7.6).Mothers described three types of breastfeeding experiences affected by the maternal environmental factor of professional support. One mother's experience overlapped between the first and second group. The first group (n=4) recalled breastfeeding success with no or limited professional support. The second group (n = 11) breastfed successfully after receiving positive professional support (one mother overlapped with group one), and the third group (n = 6) had variable success with breastfeeding after receiving unfavorable professional support. Support provided to the second and third groups was given for inexperience, anatomical barriers and neonates that demonstrated an 'insatiable feeding', i.e., frequent vigorous feeding without ceasing after satiation.The mothers of neonates later diagnosed with ASD described having similar breastfeeding experiences and challenges compared to the typically developing population. The mothers of neonates also described a triad of neonatal breastfeeding behaviors that merit future research, 'insatiable feeding', a vigorous suck that did not stop with satiation, diminished social interaction, and > 70th percentile for weight for many of the infants during the first year.Taken together, these findings support using the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing to guide future studies using NNBO biobehavioral measures. The findings also support future research to quantify the breastfeeding behavior of 'insatiable feeding' for a potential screening tool for neonates at-risk for ASD.","2011-01","2019-02-14 12:29:24","2019-02-14 12:29:24","","","152 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Chicago","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3498039","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Child; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Semi-Structured Interview; Convenience Sample; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Age; Descriptive Statistics; Retrospective Design; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Breast Feeding; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Heart Rate -- Physiology; Conceptual Framework; Autistic Disorder -- In Infancy and Childhood; Evoked Potentials; Infant Nutrition; Neurophysiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age. METHODS: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (≥300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%- 16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming ≥300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.17) but at a nonsignificant level.

After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.","2009-12","2019-02-14 12:29:25","2019-02-14 12:29:25","","1267-1276","","12","29","","Cephalalgia","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Comorbidity; Socioeconomic Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Drug Therapy; Life Style; Analgesics -- Therapeutic Use; Analgesics, Opioid -- Therapeutic Use; Antiinflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal -- Therapeutic Use; Migraine -- Drug Therapy; Migraine -- Epidemiology; Vasoconstrictor Agents -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is an important question to resolve because choline, if taken periconceptionally, might add to the protective effect currently being achieved by folic acid. Objective: We examined the relation between NTDs, choline status, and genetic polymorphisms reported to influence de novo choline synthesis to investigate claims that taking choline periconceptionally could reduce NTD rates. Design: Two study groups of pregnant women were investigated: women who had a current NTD-affected pregnancy (AP; n = 71) and unaffected controls (n = 214) and women who had an NTD in another pregnancy but not in the current pregnancy [nonaffected pregnancy (NAP); n = 98] and unaffected controls (n = 386). Blood samples to measure betaine and total choline concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms related to choline metabolism were collected at their first prenatal visit. Results: Mean (±SD) plasma total choline concentrations in the AP (2.8 ± 1.0 mmol/L) and control (2.9 ± 0.9 mmol/L) groups did not differ significantly. Betaine concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Total choline and betaine in the NAP group did not differ from controls. Cases were significantly more likely to have the G allele of phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT; V175M, +5465 G>A) rs7946 (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Our results indicate that maternal betaine and choline concentrations are not strongly associated with NTD risk. The association between PEMT rs7946 and NTDs requires confirmation. The addition of choline to folic acid supplements may not further reduce NTD risk.","2014-10","2019-02-14 12:29:26","2019-02-14 12:29:26","","1069-1074","","4","100","","American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Comparative Studies; T-Tests; Kruskal-Wallis Test; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; P-Value; Genotype; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prepregnancy Care; Choline -- Administration and Dosage -- In Pregnancy; Choline -- Blood -- In Pregnancy; Homocysteine -- Blood -- In Pregnancy; Neural Tube Defects -- Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maternal 24-h dietary recalls, fasting glucose, and 2-h glucose concentrations were ascertained at 26-28 wk gestation for 1061 women (aged 30.7 ± 5.1 y). Night-fasting intervals were based on the longest fasting duration during the night (1900-0659). Eating episodes were defined as events that provided >50 kcal, with a time interval between eating episodes of ≥15 min. Multiple linear regressions with adjustment for confounders were conducted.Results: Mean ± SD night-fasting intervals and eating episodes per day were 9.9 ± 1.6 h and 4.2 ± 1.3 times/d, respectively; fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations were 4.4 ± 0.5 and 6.6 ± 1.5 mmol/L, respectively. In adjusted models, each hourly increase in night-fasting intervals was associated with a 0.03 mmol/L decrease in fasting glucose (95% CI: -0.06, -0.01 mmol/L), whereas each additional daily eating episode was associated with a 0.15 mmol/L increase in 2-h glucose (95% CI: 0.03, 0.28 mmol/L).

Subjects and methods: We conducted a cohort study among 76 women with low risk pregnancies recruited in their third trimester of pregnancy and followed their infants until 12 months of age. BAEP tests were conducted on the infants before 3 months of age during physiologic sleep, using 100 msec bipolar clicks. Maternal dietary intake was evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. Two BAEP groups (short latency, long latency) were identified by cluster analysis. The association between BAEP group and maternal PUFAs was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic and biological factors. Results: Short latency BAEPs were associated with a maternal diet rich in arachidonic acid (OR=3.63, 95% CI 1.23–10.67) after adjusting for age (in days) sex, head circumference and gestational age but was not significantly associated to a maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

For 384 mothers aged 30.8 ± 4.8 y (mean ± SD), the night-fasting interval at 26-28 wk of gestation was determined from a 3-d food diary based on the average of the fasting duration at night (1900-0659). Offspring birth weight, length, and head circumference were measured and converted to weight-for-gestational age (GA), length-for-GA, and head circumference-for-GA z scores, respectively, by using local customized percentile charts. The percentage of neonatal total body fat (TBF) was derived by using a validated prediction equation. Multivariable general linear models, stratified by child sex, were performed.Results: The mean ± SD maternal night-fasting interval was 9.9 ± 1.3 h.

The circadian clock is a transcriptional/epigenetic molecular machinery synchronising physiological processes to coordinate energy utilisation within a 24-h light/dark period. Alterations in rhythmicity have profound effects on metabolic pathways, which we sought to investigate in offspring with programmed NAFLD.Methods: Mice were fed a standard or an obesogenic diet (OD), before and throughout pregnancy, and during lactation. Offspring were weaned onto standard or an OD at 3 weeks postpartum and housed in 12:12 light/dark conditions. Biochemical and histological indicators of NAFLD and fibrosis, analysis of canonical clock genes with methylation status and locomotor activity were investigated at 6 months.Results: We show that maternal obesity interacts with an obesogenic post-weaning diet to promote the development of NAFLD with disruption of canonical metabolic rhythmicity gene expression in the liver. We demonstrate hypermethylation of BMAL-1 (brain and muscle Arnt like-1) and Per2 promoter regions and altered 24-h rhythmicity of hepatic pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators.Conclusions: These data implicate disordered circadian rhythms in NAFLD and suggest that disruption of this system during critical developmental periods may be responsible for the onset of chronic liver disease in adulthood.","2015-09","2019-02-14 12:29:31","2019-02-14 12:29:31","","1339-1348","","9","39","","International Journal of Obesity","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence.Methods:A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament.Results:Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby.Conclusion:The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers.

METHODS: The sample included 17 SSRI-exposed and 17 nonexposed, full-birth-weight newborn infants who had no obvious medical problems and were matched on maternal cigarette use, social class, and maternal age. SSRI exposure was determined by medical records and maternal self-report during a standard interview. Behavioral state, startles, and tremulousness were evaluated for 1 hour between feedings. Automated recordings of motor activity and HRV were also assessed during a 15-minute subset sleep period. HRV was subjected to spectral analysis to detect rhythms in autonomic regulation. Exposed and nonexposed infant groups were compared on measures of neurobehavioral development both before and after adjustment for gestational age as a covariate. RESULTS: SSRI-exposed infants had a shorter mean gestational age; were more motorically active and tremulous; and showed fewer rhythms in HRV, fewer changes in behavioral state, fewer different behavioral states, and a lower peak behavioral state. SSRI-exposed infants also had significantly more rapid eye movement sleep, which was characterized by longer continuous bouts in that state and higher numbers of spontaneous startles or sudden arousals. After effects of gestational age were covaried, significant differences continued to be found in tremulousness and all measures of state and sleep organization, but effects on startles, motor activity, and rhythms in HRV were no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide the first systematic evidence that women who use SSRIs during pregnancy have healthy, full-birth-weight newborn infants who show disruptions in a wide range of neurobehavioral outcomes. Effects on motor activity, startles, and HRV may be mediated through the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age. Future research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of SSRI use during pregnancy and an improved public health outcome.","2004-02","2019-02-14 12:29:32","2019-02-14 12:29:32","","368-375","","2","113","","Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; North Carolina; Adult; Human; Convenience Sample; Infant, Newborn; Chi Square Test; Comparative Studies; T-Tests; Record Review; Clinical Assessment Tools; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Infant Behavior; Observational Methods; Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors -- Administration and Dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insufficient sleep results in metabolic alterations and increased inflammation, both known to contribute to placental abruption (abruption), a determinant of PTD. We examined associations of abruption with sleep duration and complaints of vital exhaustion.Methods: The study included 164 abruption cases and 160 controls in a multicenter study in Peru. Data on habitual sleep duration and vital exhaustion during the first 6 months of pregnancy were elicited during interviews conducted following delivery. Women were categorized according to short, normal and long sleep duration (≤6, 7-8 and ≥9 h); and frequency of feeling exhausted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.Results: Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased odds of abruption.

This scoping review summarises current literature on maternal sleep including sleep disordered breathing, sleep quality, sleep duration and supine sleep position, as these relate to fetal outcomes specifically birth weight, growth, preterm birth and stillbirth. An overall interpretation of the studies evaluated shows that events occurring during maternal sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea, sleep disruption and sleep position may have a negative effect on the fetus resulting in altered growth, gestational length and even death. These effects are biologically and physically plausible. In conclusion, there is limited and often conflicting information on maternal sleep and fetal outcomes. However, existing evidence suggests that this is an important area for future research.

Maternal SDB may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this is still under investigation. We performed a systematic literature review, and where feasible, a metaanalysis, to evaluate whether women with SDB in pregnancy have a higher risk of specific adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with women without SDB. STUDY DESIGN: Original studies published until June 2012 evaluating the association between gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight infants, and maternal SDB, defined either by symptoms or the reference standard polysomnography, were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data were extracted on study design and outcome estimates. When appropriate, effect estimates from each study were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of the 4386 studies identified, 31 met the defined criteria. Twenty-one studies, all observational in design, reported dichotomous outcomes; 9 of these adjusted for potential confounders. Maternal SDB was significantly associated with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia (pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-3.09; 5 studies), and gestational diabetes (pooled aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; 5 studies). CONCLUSION: Based on published observational studies to date, maternal SDB is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes after adjusting for potential confounders. However, large-scale, prospective cohort, and interventional studies are needed to further elucidate the relationship between maternal SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes.","2014-01","2019-02-14 12:29:34","2019-02-14 12:29:34","","52.e1-52.e14","","1","210","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Etiology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Complications; PubMed; Systematic Review; Embase; Meta Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Earlier studies, using mainly snoring as a surrogate marker for SDB, have shown an increase in the prevalence of SDB during pregnancy compared with that in the pregravid state. More recently, prospective observational studies in which the investigators ascertained SDB by using complete polysomnography have shown a prevalence ranging from approximately 17% to 45% in the third trimester. Pregnancy itself can be associated with daytime hypersomnolence, so complaints of increasing fatigue and sleepiness during pregnancy are not specific for SDB. Moreover, snoring in isolation also has relatively poor sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool for diagnosing maternal SDB. The indications for screening for SDB during routine obstetric prenatal visits are still unclear, but observational studies indicate that maternal SDB is linked with the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus. Some studies also have identified a relationship between maternal SDB and the delivery of infants who are small for gestational age. Aside from a few small interventional studies of CPAP in pregnant patients with gestational hypertension, little currently is known about whether treatment of SDB during pregnancy improves clinical outcomes for the mother and/or baby. Additional current knowledge gaps include elucidating underlying mechanisms of maternal SDB, determining optimal treatment strategies, and understanding the trajectory of SDB after delivery.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:29:34","2019-02-14 12:29:34","","1052-1066","","4","153","","CHEST","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were a follow-up cohort of 94 women (mean age 33.3, SD=4.4), who were depressed during pregnancy and part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Participants were evaluated 10 weeks after delivery, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and daily sleep logs for one week. On average, women woke to attend to the infant 2.2 times (SD=1.1) and spent 47.3 min (SD=33.0) awake to attend to the infant. Regression analysis revealed that the number of times a woman's sleep was disrupted by attending to her infant was a significant predictor of her perceived subjective sleep quality; however, the total amount of time she spent attending to her infant and her depressive symptom severity were not predictors. The findings of this study suggest that during the third postpartum month, sleep fragmentation appears more detrimental to maternal subjective sleep quality than amount of time awake during the night. This finding is relevant to the implementation of clinical interventions for improving maternal subjective sleep quality during the early postpartum period.","2010-11","2019-02-14 12:29:35","2019-02-14 12:29:35","","384-391","","4","28","","Journal of Reproductive & Infant Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","California; Female; Interviews; Sleep; Prospective Studies; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Postnatal Period; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Regression; Diaries; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Depression, Postpartum -- Psychosocial Factors; Interview Guides; Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The contents of these interviews were analyzed and compared with medical caregivers' assessments of the transferred patient's experiences. This study was designed to further understand (1) the impact of transfer on the high risk pregnant patients and (2) the medical caregivers' observation of the impact. Twenty maternal transports were interviewed and audiotaped soon after the transport was completed in an open-interview format. A content analysis of the interviews identified the problems and events of the maternal transport experience during preparation, travel and arrival. Thirty one medical caregivers were asked similar questions which determined their cognizance of the patients perceptions and problems. The study results demonstrated patient concern for enroute delivery as well as for their fetal and pregnancy outcome. Patient focus away from the pregnancy and toward their abnormal bodily changes, physical discomforts, and medication side effects attested to the difficult adaptation of a complicated pregnancy. Support from family and friends was important but also more difficult when separated by distance. Patients described the nurse's helpfulness more often as giving information, support and guiding them through unfamiliar events than by providing physical care, while the nurses stated the opposite. Nurses were perceived as the person who helped the most. Arriving at the final specialized hospital destination was described as a relief and signaled increased confidence and increased hope for the pregnancy. It was discovered that sending hospitals positively prepared the patient for these feelings. Patient responses were aligned with Rubin's developmental stages of pregnancy but not with the usual changes observed in a high risk pregnancy. Coping responses of maternal transports included sensations of self-detachment and the use of diversion and sleep. Responses toward the transport experience included fear of the unknown, lack of understanding of both anticipated and current events, disbelief of the pregnancy events and concern for family separation. Caregivers underestimated the patient's level of concern and fear as well as her specific concerns for the unborn baby including enroute delivery.","1990-01","2019-02-14 12:29:36","2019-02-14 12:29:36","","","261 p","","","","","","","","","","UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO","","","","","c8h","UMI Order PUZ9121564","EBSCOhost","","ED.D.","","","","Female; Interviews; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Audiorecording; Attitude to Pregnancy; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Content Analysis; Attitude of Health Personnel; Patient Attitudes; Perinatal Nursing; Nurse-Patient Relations; Pregnancy, High Risk -- Psychosocial Factors; Rubin's Theory of Maternal Identity; Transfer, Discharge -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is easily emitted into the atmosphere, posing a significant risk to human health. However, limited studies have described the impact of naphthalene exposure on birth outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between the maternal urinary metabolites of naphthalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-OH NAP), and birth outcomes.Method: In the present study, four urinary PAH metabolites were measured in 263 pregnant women during late pregnancy. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the concentrations of 2-OH NAP and birth outcomes, and restricted cubic spline models were further used to examine the shapes of the dose-response association.Result: General linear models showed that prenatal urinary 2-OH NAP was associated with lower birth weight (BW) (- 4.38% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.049) and higher cephalization index (CI) (4.30% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.038). These associations were linear and significant when 2-OH NAP was modeled as a continuous variable in restricted cubic spline models (P linear = 0.0293 for 2-OH NAP and BW; P linear = 0.0326 for 2-OH NAP and CI). Multiple linear regression data indicated that each 1 ln-unit increase in 2-OH NAP was significantly associated with a 2.09 g/cm increase in the CI. The associations among 2-OH NAP, BW, and CI were also observed in a subset of participants residing close to arterial traffic.Conclusion: Our data indicated that prenatal exposure to naphthalene had an adverse effect on fetal birth outcomes, especially the brain development index. Reduced exposure to naphthalene may improve newborn health outcomes. In Taiyuan, naphthalene may result from traffic pollution.","2018-12-20","2019-02-14 12:29:37","2019-02-14 12:29:37","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","1","17","","Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental functioning, including the 11β-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines, compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the fetus.","2014-10","2019-02-14 12:29:38","2019-02-14 12:29:38","","943-956","","10","23","","European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Child Development; Adrenal Glands; Catecholamines; Child Development Disorders -- Risk Factors; Hippocampus; Hydrocortisone -- Physiology; Immune System -- Physiopathology -- In Pregnancy; Pituitary Gland; Placental Insufficiency -- Physiopathology; Stress -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Stress -- Physiopathology -- In Utero; Stress -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Pregnancy; Stress -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Utero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being.

Objective To assess the efficacy and tolerability of memantine for migraine prophylaxis. Methods This was a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Sixty patients with migraine without aura were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive memantine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline in the monthly attack frequency at week 12 between the two groups (using migraine diary). Secondary efficacy measures were assessed using several clinical, functional, and psychological instruments. We performed both complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat analyses (ITT). Results Twenty-five patients in the memantine group and 27 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Patients in the memantine group showed significantly greater reduction (mean change; 3.4; 95%CI, 2.3-4.4) in the monthly attack frequency than the placebo group (mean change, 1.0; 95%CI, 0.3-1.7) (mean difference [MD], 2.3; 95%CI, 1.1-3.5, P < .001). Both CC (MD, 4.9; 95%CI, 2.6-7.2 days), and ITT analyses (MD, 5.2; 95%CI, 2.0-8.5) showed significantly higher reduction in the mean number of migraine days in the memantine group than the placebo group ( P < .01). Patients in the memantine group experienced greater reduction in the number of work absence days, severity, and disability score than the patients in the placebo group in both ITT and CC analyses. Changes in quality of life, sleep, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups. Three patients in the memantine group complained of sedation, mild vertigo and nausea, and drowsiness. In the placebo group, one patient complained of nausea and another patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to vertigo. Conclusion Memantine might be a tolerable and efficacious option for prophylaxis in patients with migraine without aura. Tolerability, short duration required for titration, and safety profile in pregnancy might give memantine an advantage over other antimigraine medications. The study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (Registration number: IRCT2013120115616N1).","2016-01","2019-02-14 12:29:41","2019-02-14 12:29:41","","95-103","","1","56","","Headache: The Journal of Head & Face Pain","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Questionnaires; Human; Outpatients; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Power Analysis; Scales; Confidence Intervals; Randomized Controlled Trials; Regression; Academic Medical Centers; Double-Blind Studies; Migraine -- Drug Therapy; Memantine; Premedication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Māori community in New Zealand has reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of this traditional sleeping device.Methods/design: This two arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from Māori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related) touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal sleep patterns.Discussion: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken worldwide.Trials Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000993099 Registered 16th November 2010.","2014-01","2019-02-14 12:29:55","2019-02-14 12:29:55","","240-240","","1","14","","BMC Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BACKGROUND: Migraine predominantly affects women of childbearing age and is often associated with the menstrual period, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of migraine and menstrual disorders. METHODS: Women diagnosed with migraine, using International Headache Society criteria and an age- and sex-matched control group, were administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding migraine and migraine-related disability, menstrual history, other bleeding history, vascular event history, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Fifty female migraineurs between the ages of 22 and 50 years and 52 age-matched women (mean age 37 years) were enrolled in the study. Similar proportions of women in each group reported using hormone contraceptives (30% vs. 33%, P = .77) and hormone replacement therapy (12% vs. 8%, P = .69). The proportions presently menstruating (64% vs. 80%, P = .20) and status after hysterectomy were similar (24% vs. 14%, P = .84). Menorrhagia (defined as at least three consecutive heavy periods), both current and prior, was more commonly reported in migraineurs (63% vs. 37%, P = .009), with higher likelihood of staining clothes by menses (35% vs. 8%, P = .003), and significant impact of menses on activities of daily living (on a 10-point Likert scale) with work/school participation (P = .02), family activities (P < .0001), sleep (P = .003), life enjoyment (P = .001), mood (P = .02), and overall quality of life (P = .003). Endometriosis, which may be associated with menorrhagia, was also more commonly diagnosed in the migraineurs (30% vs. 4%, P = .001). The migraineurs more frequently described bruising (40% vs. 10%, P < .001) and rectal bleeding (18% vs. 2%, P = .017) but not more serious bleeding problems. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in the migraine group (28% vs. 12%, P = .036), and significance for increased menorrhagia, endometriosis, menstrual interference, and bruising was maintained, even when controlling for the use of NSAIDs. With logistic regression, menorrhagia was significantly associated with migraine, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.5), and with endometriosis, adjusted OR = 10.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 51.4). There were no differences in vascular events and risk factors, except for trends of increased hypertension (25% vs. 10%, P = .05), transient ischemic attack/stroke (10% vs. 2%, P = .08), and Raynaud's disease (10% vs. 2%, P = .08) in the migraineurs. CONCLUSION: Women with migraine have a higher frequency of menorrhagia, endometriosis, and associated psychosocial consequences. These findings suggest that there should be further study of factors influencing endometriosis and menstrual blood flow, such as eicosanoids and platelet function, in migraineurs.","2006-03","2019-02-14 12:29:56","2019-02-14 12:29:56","","422-428","","3","46","","Headache: The Journal of Head & Face Pain","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Odds Ratio; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Middle Age; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; T-Tests; Research Instruments; Confidence Intervals; Mann-Whitney U Test; P-Value; Data Analysis, Statistical; Endometriosis -- Complications; Menorrhagia -- Complications; Migraine -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In pregnancy, women often experience significant disruptions in their daily rhythms, including changes in day-to-day schedule and sleep habits. Current evidence suggests that these disruptions in daily rhythms may adversely affect underlying circadian rhythmicity. The purpose of our study was to examine whether subjectively rated daily rhythm disruptions were associated with a greater incidence of depressive symptoms during the third trimester. Method: Our study was a cross-sectional design, assessing sleep quality, symptoms of depression, and daily rhythm disruptions in 51 pregnant women in their third trimester. Results: We observed a significant relationship between mild depressive symptoms and disruptions in daily rhythms. While we initially observed a strong correlation between subjective sleep quality and depressive symptoms, this was attenuated after accounting for daily rhythm disruptions. Disruptions in daily social rhythms, eating patterns, and general activity were all significantly associated with depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Our findings point to a strong correlation between daily rhythm disruptions and prenatal depressive symptoms. Given that these daily rhythms are known to act as zeitgebers, longitudinal studies examining the directionality of this relationship between circadian rhythms and depressive symptoms during pregnancy are warranted.","2016-06","2019-02-14 12:29:57","2019-02-14 12:29:57","","594-598","","6","25","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Effect Size; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Psychological Tests; Scales; Summated Rating Scaling; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Women's Health; Linear Regression; P-Value; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Circadian Rhythm -- In Pregnancy; Ontario","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The usefulness of the Japanese version of 'The Highs' self-rating scale is evaluated and the prevalence of mild hypomania phenomenon for 5 days postpartum is measured. One hundred and nineteen pregnant women in Mie, Japan, agreed to participate in this research. The Japanese women reported feeling elated, especially on the first postpartum day. They also reported feeling the need for less sleep. Many women felt that they could reduce their sleep during hospitalization. There was a relationship between the primipara and the multipara in the obstetric factors selected for study and the occurrence of mild hypomania after delivery. There were not clear correlations in 'The Highs' scores for the nursing actions. It is suggested that the after-effect of stress would be highly correlated to elation, and there is some biological mechanism triggered especially on the first day postpartum.","2000-12","2019-02-14 12:29:58","2019-02-14 12:29:58","","231-235","","4","2","","Nursing & Health Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Convenience Sample; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; T-Tests; Correlational Studies; Postnatal Period; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Japan; Affect -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Untreated psychological distress in pregnancy is associated with poor obstetrical outcomes, changes in maternal physiology, elevated incidence of child physical and psychological disorders, and is predictive of maternal postpartum mood disorders. Despite the wide-ranging impact of antenatal psychological distress on mothers and their children, there is a gap in our knowledge about the most effective treatments that are available for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy. Additionally, no trials have focused on potential physiological changes that may occur as a result of receiving mindfulness training in pregnancy. The proposed trial will determine the effectiveness of an 8-week modified Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) intervention delivered during pregnancy.Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT to treat psychological distress in pregnancy. A sample of 60 consenting pregnant women aged 18 years and above will be enrolled and randomized to the experimental (MBCT) or control (treatment as usual) condition. Primary (e.g., symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety), secondary (cortisol, blood pressure (BP), heart rate variability (HRV), and sleep) and other outcome data (e.g., psychological diagnoses) will be collected via a combination of laboratory visits and at-home assessments from both groups at baseline (T1), immediately following the intervention (T2), and at 3 months postpartum (T3). Descriptive statistics will be used to describe sample characteristics. Data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Hierarchical linear models will be used to test intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes.Discussion: The trial is expected to improve knowledge about evidence-based treatments for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy and to evaluate the potential impact of mindfulness-based interventions on maternal physiology.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02214732 , registered on 7 August 2014.

The effects of variables on mindful-yoga were studied over time, comparing baseline (Time1) and post-intervention (Time2) data in a single treatment group of 19 English-speaking nulliparous women with healthy pregnancies, 17 of whom adhered to the intervention that met for seven weekly sessions.Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, correlations, parametric and nonparametric paired comparisons, and effect sizes. Participants were well-educated, middleclass, and planning vaginal birth. Although no one was currently being treated for psychiatric disorders, nearly 30% had a history of depression or anxiety.The intervention resulted in higher scores for two facets of mindfulness (Observing and Nonreacting). From Time1 to Time2, third trimester participants demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress and trait anxiety. Second trimester women demonstrated improvements in pain and sleep. In contrast, the third trimester group experienced worse pain and sleep as pregnancy progressed. To control for gestation, Time1 data for the 8 women who began mindful-yoga in the third trimester (26.5 weeks +/-2.3) were compared with Time2 data for the 9 women who began mindful-yoga in the second trimester (27.1 weeks +/-4.1). Second trimester women at Time2 experienced improved sleep (fewer night awakenings and less wake time during the night) as measured by wrist actigraphy compared to third trimester group baseline data.This study demonstrated important clinical improvements in sleep and pain for women who began mindful-yoga in their second trimester. Mindful-yoga intervention merits further research for reducing perceived stress and anxiety and second trimester sleep enhancement and pain reduction. The mechanisms of mindful-yoga on stress appraisal, anxiety, sleep, and pain were not clearly linked to mindfulness, and further studies are required to develop theoretical linkages between mindful-yoga and symptom reduction during pregnancy.","2007-01","2019-02-14 12:30:00","2019-02-14 12:30:00","","","167 p","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Francisco","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3274963","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Effect Size; Correlational Studies; Prenatal Care; Pregnancy -- Psychosocial Factors; Pilot Studies; Sleep Disorders -- Prevention and Control; Mindfulness; Stress Management; Nonparametric Statistics; Parametric Statistics; Pretest-Posttest Design; Pain -- Prevention and Control; Time Series; Yoga -- Classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed cosmic radiation and circadian disruption from company records of 2 million individual flights. Using Cox regression models, we compared respondents (1) by levels of flight exposures and (2) to teachers from the same cities, to evaluate whether these exposures were associated with miscarriage.Results: Of 2654 women interviewed (2273 flight attendants and 381 teachers), 958 pregnancies among 764 women met study criteria. A hypothetical pregnant flight attendant with median first-trimester exposures flew 130 hours in 53 flight segments, crossed 34 time zones, and flew 15 hours during her home-base sleep hours (10 pm-8 am), incurring 0.13 mGy absorbed dose (0.36 mSv effective dose) of cosmic radiation. About 2% of flight attendant pregnancies were likely exposed to a solar particle event, but doses varied widely. Analyses suggested that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of miscarriage in weeks 9-13 (odds ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval = 0.95-3.2]). Risk of a first-trimester miscarriage with 15 hours or more of flying during home-base sleep hours was increased (1.5 [1.1-2.2]), as was risk with high physical job demands (2.5 [1.5-4.2]).

While several studies have shown an association between mode of birth and symptoms of postnatal depression, others have found no relationship. Aims: To determine whether women who have instrumental or caesarean births report higher levels of poor coping, sleep or appetite disturbance, or relationship difficulties, than women who have vaginal births, at the time of Universal Postnatal Contact (7-10 days post-discharge). Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort study of term, singleton births from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2013 at a tertiary obstetric facility. Outcomes were compared for 1816 women having vaginal births versus 1205 women having instrumental or caesarean births. Results: When adjusted for confounders, no association could be demonstrated between mode of birth and reporting of any postnatal symptom of psychological morbidity. However, the model did demonstrate an association between reporting of symptoms and nulliparity (aOR 1.69 (1.08-2.63); P = 0.02), as well as having an unplanned pregnancy with a supportive partner (aOR 0.54 (0.29-0.97); P = 0.04). Conclusions: Mode of birth does not appear to be associated with the reporting of symptoms of psychological morbidity in the early postnatal period. However, these symptoms may be associated with nulliparity and in the context of an unplanned pregnancy, a lack of partner support. These findings highlight the ongoing need for antenatal screening with respect to pregnancy intention and the presence of a social support system, to facilitate the implementation of interventions for women at risk of postnatal depression.","2015-12","2019-02-14 12:30:01","2019-02-14 12:30:01","","578-583","","6","55","","Australian & New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Prospective Studies; Logistic Regression; Descriptive Statistics; Postnatal Period; Confidence Intervals; Surveys; Depression, Postpartum; Regression; Depression -- Symptoms; Multivariate Analysis; Sensitivity and Specificity; Vaginal Birth; Interpreter Services; Pregnancy, Unplanned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It prepares the infant for extrauterine life, and prepares the mother for lactation and safe return to the non-pregnant state. However, added stressors can have repercussions. This study aims to describe added stressors (including prenatal maternal socio-demographic and psychological factors) affecting mode of delivery (MOD), and the effect of MOD on mother-infant health at one month postpartum.Approximately 150 first-time, English-speaking, expectant mothers, at least 18 years of age, recruited from San Francisco, California prenatal clinics, participated in a postpartum intervention sleep study. Women were excluded if they had a sleep or mood disorder, or worked nights. This is a secondary analysis of these data.Prenatal maternal socio-demographic and risk factors (depression, anxiety, attitudes/adjustment, perceived stress) were evaluated by MOD outcome using analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-tests, Mann Whitney U, and Kruskall-Wallis. Labor induction/augmentation was evaluated by maternal report of non-reassuring fetal status (NRFS) with NRFS as the key outcome, analyzed by Chi-Square and logistic regression. Lastly, MOD was evaluated for effect on maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety, infant temperament rating, infant sleep, and breastfeeding continuation at one month using ANOVA and Chi-Square statistics.Prenatal depression and anxiety symptoms were not associated with MOD (normal vaginal, instrument vaginal, cesarean in labor, or scheduled cesarean). Mothers with a prenatal 'attitude toward baby' score that was more positive were more likely to have an unplanned cesarean birth. A scheduled cesarean birth was more likely in older women and those with higher pre-pregnancy BMI. Maternal reports of NRFS were associated with induction/augmentation. One month postpartum measures of maternal symptoms, maternal adjustment, infant temperament, and breastfeeding did not differ by MOD. However, according to maternal diary entries, cesarean-born infants slept an average of one hour more during the day than infants born vaginally.These findings provide preliminary indication that prenatal attitude toward baby plays a role in MOD, induction/augmentation is associated with increased NRFS, and cesarean birth is associated with increased infant sleep at one month. Nurses should develop and test interventions to minimize prenatal and labor factors that unnecessarily add to delivery stress.","2011-01","2019-02-14 12:30:01","2019-02-14 12:30:01","","","131 p","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Francisco","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3461020","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","California; Body Mass Index; Human; Chi Square Test; T-Tests; Analysis of Variance; Kruskal-Wallis Test; Mann-Whitney U Test; Risk Assessment; Outcomes (Health Care); Childbirth -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research Question What are the sleep practices of women in late pregnancy, and what are their views about changing going-to-sleep position if this was recommended? Significance Maternal sleep position in late pregnancy is a modifiable risk factor for late stillbirth. A 2011 study from Auckland, New Zealand, was the first to demonstrate a 2-fold increased risk for women who did not go to sleep on their left side the night before the fetus was thought to have died, with the highest risk for women who settled to sleep supine. This association has since been confirmed by an Australian and Ghanaian study and a New Zealand multicentre study. Methods A random sample of ethnically-representative women (N = 377), between 28 and 42 weeks' gestation, were surveyed in 2014 in South Auckland, New Zealand, a multicultural and socioeconomically disadvantaged population with an increased risk of stillbirth. Factors independently associated with non-left side going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results Self-reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left (30%), right (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%), and other (6%). The majority (68%) had received advice about pregnancy sleep position. A non-left position was more likely to be reported by women of Maori (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.46-5.78) ethnicity, and those who did not sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR, 3.29; 95% CI, 2.03-5.32). Most (87%) non-left sleepers reported that they would have minimal difficulty changing to going to sleep on their left side in late pregnancy if this was better for their fetus. Discussion The results from this survey suggest that going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy is likely to be readily modifiable. This suggests that a public health intervention, about the importance of optimal late pregnancy going-to-sleep position to optimise fetal well-being, is likely to be feasible in similar communities with an increased risk of stillbirth.","2017-10-09","2019-02-14 12:30:02","2019-02-14 12:30:02","","632-632","","5","62","","Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Fetus; Pregnancy; Human; Expectant Mothers; Descriptive Statistics; Self Report; Confidence Intervals; New Zealand; Surveys; Gestational Age; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Random Sample; Multiple Logistic Regression; Perinatal Death -- Risk Factors; Fetal Well-Being; Body Positions -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information about these behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends in maternal and infant health, enhance understanding of the relation between maternal behaviors and infant health outcomes, plan and evaluate maternal and infant health programs, direct policy decisions, and monitor progress toward achieving the national Healthy People 2010 [HP 2010] objectives (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy people 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington, DC: US Department of Health and Human Services; 2000).Reporting Period Covered: 2000--2003.Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers; nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants. This report summarizes data for 2000--2003 from 19 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia) that measured progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives for eight perinatal indicators: 1) pregnancy intention, 2) multivitamin use, 3) physical abuse, 4) cigarette smoking during pregnancy, 5) cigarette smoking cessation, 6) drinking alcohol during pregnancy, 7) breastfeeding initiation, and 8) infant sleep position.Results: In 2003, prevalence of intended pregnancy among women having a live birth ranged from 48.1% in Louisiana to 66.5% in Maine; during 2000--2003, no state experienced a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase in prevalence of intended pregnancy, and one state experienced a significant decrease. In 2003, prevalence of multivitamin use at least four times per week during the month before pregnancy ranged from 23.0% in Arkansas to 45.2% in Maine; during 2000--2003, multivitamin use increased significantly in three states (Illinois, North Carolina, and Utah). In 2003, prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during the 12 months before pregnancy ranged from 2.2% in Maine to 7.6% in New Mexico; during 2000--2003, significant decreases were recorded in three states (Alaska, Hawaii, and Nebraska). In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from cigarette smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 72.5% in West Virginia to 96.1% in Utah; during 2000--2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of smoking cessation during pregnancy ranged from 30.2% in West Virginia to 65.8% in Utah; during 2000--2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 91.3% in Colorado to 98.0% in Utah; during 2000--2003, abstinence increased significantly in Louisiana and Utah but decreased significantly in Florida and Nebraska. In 2003, prevalence of mothers who breastfed their babies in the early postpartum period ranged from 51.2% in Louisiana to 90.3% in Alaska; during 2000--2003, significant increases were recorded in six states (Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, and South Carolina). In 2003, prevalence of healthy full-term infants who were placed to sleep on their backs ranged from 50.0% in Arkansas to 78.7% in Washington; during 2000--2003, significant increases were recorded in eight states (Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, and West Virginia). In 2003, all 19 states achieved or exceeded the HP 2010 objective for smoking cessation during pregnancy, and 16 states achieved the HP 2010 objective for abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy. In addition, nearly half of the states achieved the objectives for breastfeeding in the early postpartum period and infant back sleep position. However, no state achieved the HP 2010 objectives for intended pregnancy, multivitamin use before pregnancy, absence of physical abuse before pregnancy, or abstinence from smoking during pregnancy.Interpretation: PRAMS data indicate variability among states regarding progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives in the area of maternal and child health. More progress has been made in achieving objectives focused on the period during and after pregnancy (e.g., smoking cessation and proper infant sleep position); less progress has been made in achieving objectives related to behaviors and experiences in the preconception period (e.g., pregnancy intention and multivitamin use).Public Health Action: State maternal and child health programs can use these state- and population-based data to monitor progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives, identify indicators to target for intervention, and plan and evaluate programs that promote positive maternal and infant health behaviors, experiences, and outcomes. These data also can be used to guide policy decisions that could affect the health of mothers and infants.","2006-10-06","2019-02-14 12:30:03","2019-02-14 12:30:03","","1-11","","39","55","","MMWR: Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Smoking -- In Pregnancy; Alcohol Drinking -- In Pregnancy; Human; United States; Infant, Newborn; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Prevalence; Self Report; Breast Feeding; Risk Assessment; Secondary Analysis; Epidemiological Research; Smoking Cessation -- In Pregnancy; Assault and Battery -- In Pregnancy; Healthy People 2010; Maternal-Child Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RECENT FINDINGS: New studies including a large meta-analysis have highlighted that weight reduction strategies are not associated with adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes, and there are suggestions that an approach of dietary modification alone may be associated with reduction in gestational weight gain. These findings are critically discussed with reference to future planned trials. New literature regarding hitherto under-reported complications of obesity in pregnancy such as ischaemic heart disease, schizophrenia and sleep disorders is highlighted. SUMMARY: There will be a need to focus on obesity prevention in the pregnant population as resources will not be adequate to the increasing incidence of the problem.","2012-12","2019-02-14 12:30:04","2019-02-14 12:30:04","","382-386","","6","24","","Current Opinion in Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Nutrition; Databases; Pregnancy -- Evaluation; Sleep Disorders -- Risk Factors; Obesity, Morbid -- Complications; Obesity, Morbid -- Physiopathology; Obstetrics; Cardiovascular Risk Factors; Diet -- Evaluation; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Obesity, Morbid -- Diagnosis; Obesity, Morbid -- Prevention and Control; Weight Gain -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, in most hospitals induction of labour with medication starts early in the morning, with the start of the working day for the day shift. In human and animal studies spontaneous onset of labour is proven to have a circadian rhythm with a preference for start of labour in the evening. Moreover, when spontaneous labour starts in the evening, the total duration of labour and delivery shortens and fewer obstetric interventions are needed. Based on these observations one might assume that starting induction of labour in the evening, in harmony with the circadian rhythm of natural birth, is more beneficial for both mother and child. To assess whether induction of labour starting in the evening, coinciding with the endogenous circadian rhythm, improves the outcome of labour compared with induction of labour starting in the early morning, organised to coincide with office hours. We contacted the Trials Search Co-ordinator to search the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2012). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to 16 February 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 16 February 2012). We included all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. We excluded trials that employed quasi-random methods of treatment allocation. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. The search resulted in 2693 articles that we screened on title and abstract for eligibility.Thirteen studies were selected for full text assessment. We included three randomised trials involving 1150 women. Two trials compared the administration of prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening in women with an unfavourable cervix, and one trial compared induction of labour in the morning versus the evening in women with a favourable cervix and/or ruptured membranes with intravenous oxytocin. Because of the different mechanism, we have reported results for these two comparisons separately.In the two trials comparing prostaglandins in the morning versus the evening there were few clinically significant differences between study groups for maternal or neonatal outcomes. One study reported a statistically significant preference by women to start induction of labour with prostaglandins in the morning.In the trial examining induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin, the number of neonatal admissions was statistically significantly increased in the group of women that started induction in the morning. This finding was unexpected, and while the trial authors offered some possible explanations for this, it is important that any future trials examine neonatal outcomes. Taking into account women's preferences that favoured administration of prostaglandins in the morning, we conclude that caregivers should preferably consider administering prostaglandins in the morning.There is no strong evidence that induction of labour with intravenous oxytocin in the evening is more or less effective than induction in the morning. Consideration may be given to start induction of labour with oxytocin in the evening when indicated.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]","2013-02","2019-02-14 12:30:05","2019-02-14 12:30:05","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","2","","","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Time Factors; Circadian Rhythm; Labor, Induced; Oxytocin -- Administration and Dosage; Prostaglandins -- Administration and Dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These characteristics were compared between those admitted in labor after morphine sleep versus those discharged. Results Fifty-eight women received morphine sleep: 36 (62%) were admitted in labor, 17 (29%) were discharged, and 5 (9%) were admitted secondary to category II fetal heart rate tracings. All fetuses had category I fetal heart rate tracings prior to treatment. Median dose of morphine sulfate was 20 mg.

The objective was to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported, differences in the same infants. DESIGN: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a room alone. SETTING: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the study. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Analysis of variance indicated that, irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.","2004-09","2019-02-14 12:30:06","2019-02-14 12:30:06","","507-511","","3","27","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","California; Female; Sleep; Infant; Adult; Human; Polysomnography; Funding Source; Regression; Analysis of Variance; Repeated Measures; Mother-Child Relations; Heart Rate -- Physiology; Body Temperature Regulation -- Physiology; Sleep, REM -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An association between multi-site pain and RLS has been reported in adult women. In the current study, we explored the association between musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and RLS in a large cohort of young adults.Methods: Twenty two year olds (n = 1072), followed since birth of part of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, provided data on MSK pain (duration, severity, frequency, number of pain sites). RLS was considered present when 4 diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening symptoms during the evening/night) and participants had these symptoms at least 5 times per month. Associations between MSK pain and RLS were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression with bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals, with final models adjusted for sex, psychological distress and sleep quality.Results: The prevalence of RLS was 3.0 % and MSK pain was reported by 37.4 % of the participants. In multivariable logistic regression models, strong associations were found between RLS-diagnosis and long duration (three months or more) of MSK pain (odds ratio 3.6, 95 % confidence interval 1.4-9.2) and reporting three or more pain sites (4.9, 1.6-14.6).Conclusions: Different dimensions of MSK pain were associated with RLS in young adults, suggestive of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Overlap between these conditions requires more clinical and research attention.","2015-10-14","2019-02-14 12:30:09","2019-02-14 12:30:09","","1-9","","","16","","BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Young Adult; Male; Restless Legs -- Epidemiology; Prevalence; Restless Legs -- Complications; Western Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous preterm infants suffer from neurological disability including cerebral palsy; visual and hearing impairments; learning difficulties; and, psychological, behavioral, and social problems. This increasing incidence of prematurity, prevalence of significant morbidity, and burden to society, both personal and cost-related, make it imperative to identify developmental care strategies such as music that might reduce this burden.This study integrates the work of music therapy, neuroscience, audiology, and medicine with nursing to address the uncertainty regarding the effect of music as a holistic health patterning modality and discover if preterm infant physiological and neurobehavioral state responses to music and ambient noise are different. The goal of this study was to establish a foundation for further research related to the use of music with preterm infants and to address the issue of safety in providing music as a health patterning modality for this population.Forty-one clinically stable, non-ventilated, appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) preterm infants from 32 to 35 weeks gestation in a large, urban Midwest Children's Hospital NICU were included in this study. An interrupted time-series design with repeated measures was used to explore the health patterning responses of preterm infants to an intentionally designed music intervention of recorded piano music. The effect of the music was measured every 30-seconds before, during, and after the sound condition of music or ambient noise by observing the oxygen saturation, heart rate, and behavioral state of randomly assigned preterm infants in the NICU in relation to a control group in which no music (only standard NICU care with recorded ambient noise) was provided.Mixed modeling was used to look at how preterm infant responses varied over time as well as changes between music and ambient noise groups of infants. Although there were no significant differences between group responses over the three time periods, there were significant changes in individual infant oxygen saturations, heart rates, and behavioral states over time. Infant oxygen saturations did not change significantly in the 10 minutes before the sound (p = .97) or during the 20 minutes of sound (p = .75); however, preterm oxygen saturation decreased significantly in the 10 minutes after presentation of the sound conditions (p = .004). Infant heart rates did not change significantly before the sound (p = .71) or during the sound (p = .54); however, preterm heart rate changes after the sound conditions approached significance by increasing during the 10 minutes after the sound conditions (p = .07). Infant behavioral states changed significantly before the sound as infants went from a state of active sleep to quiet sleep (p = .04) and after the sound as infants became slightly more aroused going from quiet sleep to active sleep (p = .05). There were no significant preterm infant behavioral state changes over the time period during the sound conditions (p = .22).Infants listening to music and those listening to ambient noise recorded from the inside of an incubator all exhibited changes in oxygen saturations, heart rates, and behavioral states during the three time periods and variability in those changes; however, these responses remained within normal limits. Findings from this study demonstrated that preterm infants in a NICU did not have adverse reactions to a carefully designed music intervention.","2008-01","2019-02-14 12:30:10","2019-02-14 12:30:10","","","173 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Minnesota","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3330515","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Human; United States; Urban Areas; Music Therapy; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Noise; Research Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SWC characteristics were determined by continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) read by two coders masked to exposure sequence. Analysis was performed in paired comparisons. ANOVA was used to assess the effects of music exposure, period and crossover on SWC outcomes: (i) Burdjalov Scores (BS) during active sleep (AS) (ii) per cent and duration of quiet sleep (QS).Results: Thirty infants were studied. A total of 222 QS cycles (median seven per patient; range five to 12) were analysed. Music exposure was associated with higher BS (F = 10.60, p = 0.0019) in AS and decreased interruptions during QS. The advanced postconceptual age (PCA) SWC pattern during AS was equivalent to a one-week mean. Number, duration and ratio of QS cycles did not change with music exposure.Conclusion: Music exposure elicits an increasing PCA pattern in AS and fewer interruptions in QS.

The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. METHODS: Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps, development of a 'sleep consciousness,' and bed-sharing. Mercer's stages of becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes into their lives.","2007-04","2019-02-14 12:30:11","2019-02-14 12:30:11","","114-122","","2","21","","Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Semi-Structured Interview; Audiorecording; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Psychological Tests; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Postnatal Period; Primiparas; Mothers; Maternal Role; Qualitative Studies; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Exploratory Research; Conceptual Framework; Dreams; Narratives -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neuroprotective peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) can prevent some of the alcohol-induced teratogenesis including fetal death, growth abnormalities, and learning impairment in part by preventing alcohol-induced alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gene expression in a mouse model for FAS. We evaluated a panel of cytokines and chemokines to determine whether NAP plus SAL work through a cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathway in preventing these alterations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized FAS model, timed, pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus peptides. Embryos were evaluated at 2 time points: after 6 hours and 10 days later at E18. A panel of cytokines/chemokines was measured using a microsphere-based multiplex immunoassay (Luminex xMAP; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Statistical analysis included Kruskal-Wallis, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: Six hours after treatment, interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant cytokine (KC) were not detectable in the control embryos. Alcohol treatment resulted in detectable levels and significant increases in IL-6 (median, 15.7; range, 10.1-45.9 pg/mL) and KC (median, 45.9; range, 32.5-99.1 pg/mL). Embryos exposed to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL had undetectable IL-6 and KC (both P < .003), similar to the controls. Alcohol exposure resulted in a significant increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (P < .003) as compared with controls, and treatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced increase. IL-13 and IL-1[beta] were decreased 6 hours after alcohol exposure, and exposure to alcohol plus NAP plus SAL did not completely ameliorate the decrease. At E18, 10 days after exposure, these alterations were no longer present. Several analytes (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted, tumor necrosis factor-[alpha], interferon-[gamma], and IL-4) were not detectable at either time point in any of the groups. CONCLUSION: Prenatal alcohol exposure acutely results in a significant elevation of IL-6, G-CSF and the KC, which are known to affect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced increases. This provides additional insight into the mechanism of alcohol damage in FAS and NAP plus SAL prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies.","2012-12","2019-02-14 12:30:13","2019-02-14 12:30:13","","499.e1-5","","6","207","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Animal Studies; Models, Biological; Cytokines -- Metabolism; Mice; Chemokines -- Drug Effects; Chemokines -- Metabolism; Ethanol; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome -- Drug Therapy; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome -- Metabolism; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor -- Drug Effects; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor -- Metabolism; Immunologic Factors -- Metabolism; Interleukins -- Metabolism; Oligopeptides -- Pharmacodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal death and learning deficits. The gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunit GABAbeta3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented alcohol-induced damage through GABAbeta3. STUDY DESIGN: With a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 microg). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for GABAbeta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher protected least significant difference. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours and 10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAbeta3 in the embryos (P < or = .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAbeta3 was higher in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was not prevented by the peptides. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the neuropeptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAbeta3 expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft lip and palate.","2007-03","2019-02-14 12:30:14","2019-02-14 12:30:14","","259.e1-5","","3","196","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Fisher's Exact Test; Analysis of Variance; Post Hoc Analysis; Animal Studies; Models, Biological; Peptides -- Therapeutic Use; Mice; Cleft Lip -- Prevention and Control; Craniofacial Abnormalities -- Etiology; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome -- Complications; GABA; GABA -- Drug Effects; Learning Disorders -- Etiology; Learning Disorders -- Prevention and Control; Neuroprotective Agents -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Education about these negative influences is urgent, especially to encourage childbearing women in a healthy diet and lifestyle. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoking in pregnancy have been known since the 1970s, yet in Germany, for example, 60% of all children are conceived, carried, born into a household where at least one adult smokes. Even if the father desists from smoking at home, the nicotine in his body tissues is transmitted to anyone near him, for example his wife when they sleep near each other. More than one glass of beer, wine or spirits per week during the pregnancy can be detected at birth. Alcohol in early in the pregnancy -- just when many mothers are unaware they are pregnant -- can produce significant physical malformation, especially in the face. Prenatal exposure to alcohol has significant effects on the intelligence and behaviour of the child. Many of these children are very restless. Even slight amounts of poisoning during the pregnancy are related to the development of a negative self-image and the compensatory behaviour of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder in later life. The Prenatal Deprivation and Poisoning Syndromes have not only been related to heart disease and eating disorders in the area of general health but also in the area of psychological health to the Borderline Personality Disorder.

Current understanding suggests that night work (work that causes disruption of a worker's circadian [day/night] rhythms) adversely affects workers' health and well-being. A complex relationship exists between circadian rhythms and reproductive hormones, and this may potentially increase the vulnerability of women to the detrimental effect of night work, including during menopause. Methods A systematic search was conducted (March-May 2011) via CINAHL, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source Premier for primary research studies written in English using the key words 'shift-work' and 'female/women.' Findings of identified articles were themed to pregnancy, fertility, aspects of menstrual cycles, and menopause. Results Twenty articles were identified, (13 articles concerning pregnancy, 3 addressing fertility, and 4 addressing aspects of the menstrual cycle) but no studies addressing menopause were located. All identified articles demonstrated problematic approaches to the determination of night-work exposure. Discussion Evidence of the impact of night work on female reproductive health as presented in the current literature is inconclusive. Moreover, available evidence needs to be interpreted with caution, given the various limitations and inconsistencies among the studies in the measurement of night-work exposure and shift-work patterns. Studies that focus specifically on night work are needed to facilitate an understanding of the impact of circadian disruption on the reproductive health of women undertaking night work.","2014-03","2019-02-14 12:30:16","2019-02-14 12:30:16","","113-126","","2","59","","Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; Human; Middle Age; CINAHL Database; Medline; Systematic Review; Women's Health; Fertility; Menopause; Reproductive Health; Menstrual Cycle; Shift Workers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study in a predominantly low-income and ethnically diverse sample of 120 first-time mothers. Both objective and subjective measures of sleep were obtained using actigraphy, diary, and self-report data. Measures were collected in the last month of pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Infant feeding diaries were used to group mothers by nighttime breastfeeding behavior. RESULTS: Mothers who used at least some formula at night (n = 54) and those who breastfed exclusively (n = 66) had similar sleep patterns in late pregnancy. However, there was a significant group difference in nocturnal sleep at one month postpartum as measured by actigraphy. Total nighttime sleep was 386 ± 66 minutes for the exclusive breastfeeding group and 356 ± 67 minutes for the formula group. The groups did not differ with respect to daytime sleep, wake after sleep onset (sleep fragmentation), or subjective sleep disturbance at one month postpartum. CONCLUSION: Women who breastfed exclusively averaged 30 minutes more nocturnal sleep than women who used formula at night, but measures of sleep fragmentation did not differ. New mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively since breastfeeding may promote sleep during postpartum recovery. Further research is needed to better understand how infant feeding method affects maternal sleep duration and fragmentation. CITATION: Doan T; Gay CL; Kennedy HP; Newman J; Lee KA.

Therefore, little is known about the evolution of night waking in early childhood. The objectives of the present study were: to identify night-waking trajectories in preschoolers, and to examine the risk factors associated with those trajectories. Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Data on a child's night waking at the ages of two, three, and five, six years, and potential confounders, were collected through parental self-reported questionnaires. Night-waking trajectories were computerized using group-based trajectory modeling on 1346 children. Two distinct developmental patterns were identified: the ""2-5 rare night-waking"" (77% of the children) and the ""2-5 common night-waking"" pattern. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated with the trajectories. Risk factors for belonging to the ""2-5 common night-waking"" trajectory were: exposure to passive smoking at home, daycare in a collective setting, watching television for extended periods, bottle feeding at night, high emotionality, and low shyness. This approach allowed identification of risk factors associated with night waking during a critical age window, and laid the groundwork for identifying children at higher risk of deleterious sleep patterns. Those risk factors were mainly living habits, which indicated that prevention and intervention programs could be highly beneficial in this population.","2016-11","2019-02-14 12:30:19","2019-02-14 12:30:19","","59-65","","","27","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Sleep; Prospective Studies; Child; Logistic Regression; Human; Depression; Risk Factors; Self Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Child, Preschool; Life Style; Multivariate Analysis; Parents -- Psychosocial Factors; Temperament; Disease Progression; France; Somnambulism -- Epidemiology; Somnambulism -- Physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two of the hallmarks of children exposed to alcohol prenatally are attention deficits and hyperactivity. While hyperactivity has been observed in rats following prenatal ethanol exposure, few studies have examined these effects in mice. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on activity in mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6 (B6), Inbred Long Sleep (ILS) and Inbred Short Sleep (ISS). Methods: On Days 7 through 18 of gestation, mice were intragastrically intubated twice daily with either 3.0 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin (MD); non-intubated control (MC) litters were also generated. Offspring activity was monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 150 days of age. Results: While results showed no effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on any measures of activity, we did observe differences in baseline activity among the strains. ISS mice were more active than B6 and ILS for all activity measures except stereotypy; B6 mice had higher measures of stereotypy than ILS and ISS. Younger mice were more active than older mice. The only sex effects were on measures of stereotypy, where males had higher scores. Conclusions: Mice are an excellent organism to study genetic influences on many phenotypes. However, our study and others have shown few effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on behavior in mice.

Noise induced hearing loss and non-auditory adverse effects due to noise pollution, are being increasingly diagnosed in all age groups including the fetus. Outdated motorized vehicles, machinery, increasing traffic, congested residential areas, crowded educational institutions and workplaces, unregulated commercial and industrial noise have become a source of noise pollution with long-term disability. Areas of noise pollution must be identified and corrective measures be taken. Toys, personal, domestic, commercial, industrial equipment should be within the safe sound intensity. Loudspeakers and vehicular horns should be banned except in emergencies. Nocturnal noise pollution must be avoided near residential areas as sleep disturbances have serious long-term health consequences. Pregnant women, fetus, newborns, infants and children are most susceptible to noise induced health hazards and should be given utmost protection. Educational institutions, workplaces, commercial and industrial areas should be regularly monitored for noise levels and protective ear muffs and plugs be used. Public be educated repeatedly regarding health hazards of noise. Traffic noise should be regulated to be within safe limits. Bus-stands, railway stations and airports should be moved away from residential areas. Houses should be sound proofed suitably. Long term studies should be conducted in pregnant women, newborn children and adults to have more data on hazards of noise pollution.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:30:20","2019-02-14 12:30:20","","300-306","","4","85","","Indian Journal of Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Child; Adolescence; Adult; Infant, Newborn; Noise; Impact of Events Scale; Personal Resource Questionnaire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short-term, chronic, and other types of insomnia are the three major categories according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd ed. The criteria for diagnosis are difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or early awakening despite the opportunity for sleep; symptoms must be associated with impaired daytime functioning and occur at least three times per week for at least one month. Factors associated with the onset of insomnia include a personal or family history of insomnia, easy arousability, poor self-reported health, and chronic pain. Insomnia is more common in women, especially following menopause and during late pregnancy, and in older adults. A comprehensive sleep history can confirm the diagnosis. Psychiatric and medical problems, medication use, and substance abuse should be ruled out as contributing factors. Treatment of comorbid conditions alone may not resolve insomnia. Patients with movement disorders (e.g., restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder), circadian rhythm disorders, or breathing disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) must be identified and treated appropriately. Chronic insomnia is associated with cognitive difficulties, anxiety and depression, poor work performance, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Insomnia can be treated with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Nonpharmacologic therapies include sleep hygiene, cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapy, multicomponent therapy, and paradoxical intention. Referral to a sleep specialist may be considered for refractory cases.","2015-12-15","2019-02-14 12:30:21","2019-02-14 12:30:21","","1058-1064","","12","92","","American Family Physician","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; United States; Middle Age; Scales; Insomnia -- Diagnosis; Aged; Insomnia -- Therapy; Practice Guidelines; Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; Aged, 80 and Over; Cognitive Therapy; Personal Resource Questionnaire; Chronic Disease -- Therapy; Education, Medical, Continuing; Relaxation Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is emerging literature to suggest that maternal sleep position may be a risk for stillbirth, especially if the woman settles to sleep supine. This risk is biologically plausible. How this knowledge may be utilized to assist stillbirth reduction strategies is discussed. Finally, we examine the somewhat limited literature regarding maternal diet and pregnancy outcome. Introducing probiotics into the diet may prove useful, but further work is required.

The Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy recruited 3702 women from the cohort to undergo objective, overnight in-home assessments of sleep disordered breathing. A standardized level 3 home sleep test was performed between 6(0)-15(0) weeks' gestation (visit 1) and again between 22(0)-31(0) weeks' gestation (visit 3). Scoring of tests was conducted by a central Sleep Reading Center. Participants and their health care providers were notified if test results met ""urgent referral"" criteria that were based on threshold levels of apnea hypopnea indices, oxygen saturation levels, or electrocardiogram abnormalities but were not notified of test results otherwise.

Linear growth is controlled by complex genetic, physiological, and nutrient-sensitive endocrine/paracrine/autocrine mediated molecular signalling mechanisms, possibly including sleep adequacy through its influence on growth hormone secretion. Inflammation, which accompanies most infections and environmental enteric dysfunction, inhibits endochondral ossification through the action of mediators including proinflammatory cytokines, the activin A-follistatin system, glucocorticoids and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). In animal models linear growth is particularly sensitive to dietary protein as well as Zn intake, which act through insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding proteins, triiodothyronine, amino acids and Zn2+ to stimulate growth-plate protein and proteoglycan synthesis and cell cycle progression, actions which are blocked by corticosteroids and inflammatory cytokines. Observational human studies indicate stunting to be associated with nutritionally poor, mainly plant-based diets. Intervention studies provide some support for deficiencies of energy, protein, Zn and iodine and for multiple micronutrient deficiencies, at least during pregnancy. Of the animal-source foods, only milk has been specifically and repeatedly shown to exert an important influence on linear growth in both undernourished and well-nourished children. However, inflammation, caused by infections, environmental enteric dysfunction, which may be widespread in the absence of clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and endogenous inflammation associated with excess adiposity, in each case contributes to stunting, and may explain why nutritional interventions are often unsuccessful. Current interventions to reduce stunting are targeting WASH as well as nutrition.","2017-06","2019-02-14 12:30:28","2019-02-14 12:30:28","","50-72","","1","30","","Nutrition Research Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Nutrition; Proteins; Child Nutrition Disorders; Infection; Intestinal Diseases -- Prevention and Control; Iodine; Micronutrients; Milk; Ossification, Heterotopic; Zinc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea–hypopnea index (AHI)>5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI)>25, AHI<5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI<25, AHI<5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson’s and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP. Results: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25±0.23, 0.58±0.55, and 0.51±0.37mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n =23), obese non-apneics (n =45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n =29), respectively. Pearson’s correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p =0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p =0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r =0.22, p =0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r =0.10, p =0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (β=0.02, p =0.01). Conclusions: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study.","2008-01","2019-02-14 12:30:32","2019-02-14 12:30:32","","149-156","","2","9","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Body Mass Index; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Polysomnography; Male; Obesity -- Epidemiology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Epidemiology; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Epidemiology; Electroencephalography; Nonparametric Statistics; Electromyography; C-Reactive Protein -- Metabolism; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Blood; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample included 148 pregnant women. Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy for five nights at the participants' home, and subjective sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale and anxiety symptoms with the Beck anxiety inventory. Significant associations were found between the subjective sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores, but there were no significant associations between actigraphic sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores. Depressive and anxiety scores emerged as significant moderators of the links between objective and subjective sleep. The findings suggest that emotional distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms severity) during pregnancy is associated with subjective sleep disturbances but not with objective sleep disturbances. Importantly, only among women with higher levels of emotional distress was subjective sleep quality associated with objective sleep quality. These findings may suggest that women with higher levels of emotional distress are not necessarily biased in their perception of sleep quality. However, they may perceive fragmented sleep as more detrimental to their wellbeing.","2016-02","2019-02-14 12:30:32","2019-02-14 12:30:32","","173-181","","1","19","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Stress, Psychological -- In Pregnancy; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Anxiety -- In Pregnancy; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Actigraphy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between OSA and preeclampsia.Methods: Between 30 and 39 weeks gestation, objective sleep apnea were evaluated in 38 normal pregnant and 40 preeclamptic women. Preeclampsia was defined by having a blood pressure (BP) > 140/90 mmHg on two occasions after the 20th week of pregnancy with excess protein in the urine (> 300 mg in 24 h) or 30 mg persistent proteinuria (+ 1 in dipsticks) in random samples. Objective sleep apnea was evaluated using an overnight in-hospital sleep evaluation using the SOMNOwatch plus Respiratory Screener. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5-14.9), moderate (15-29.9), and severe (≥ 30).Results: Mean AHI was 33.3 ± 12.1 in preeclamptic women and was 23.8 ± 15.8 in normal pregnant women (p = 0.008). There was significant difference in prevalence of OSA severity (none, mild, moderate, or severe) between groups. Out of 33 preeclamptic women, 11 women had moderate and 22 women had severe OSA. Whereas, among 33 normal pregnant women, 8, 13, and10 women had mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. Two normal pregnant women had no OSA (AHI< 5).Conclusion: Our study suggests women are susceptible to developing OSA during pregnancy that is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia.","2018-08","2019-02-14 12:30:57","2019-02-14 12:30:57","","154-159","","3","37","","Hypertension in Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adolescence; Adult; Young Adult; Polysomnography; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Complications; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Diagnosis; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Indices; Blood Pressure -- Physiology; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Physiopathology; Pre-Eclampsia -- Physiopathology; Symptoms -- Diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although pregnant women commonly report poor sleep, few studies objectively evaluated the quality of sleep in pregnancy or explored the relationship between sleep disturbances and maternal and perinatal outcomes.Objective: Our objective was to examine the relationship between objectively assessed sleep duration, timing, and continuity (measured via wrist actigraphy) and maternal cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity specific to pregnancy.Study Design: This was a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women. Women were recruited between 16 0/7 and 21 6/7 weeks' gestation. They were asked to wear a wrist actigraphy monitor and complete a daily sleep log for a period of 7 consecutive days. The primary sleep exposure variables were the averages of the following over the total valid nights (minimum 5, maximum 7 nights): short sleep duration during the primary sleep period (<7 h/night), late sleep midpoint (midpoint between sleep onset and sleep offset >5 am), and top quartile of minutes of wake time after sleep onset and sleep fragmentation index. The primary outcomes of interest were a composite of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (mild, severe, or superimposed preeclampsia; eclampsia; or antepartum gestational hypertension) and gestational diabetes mellitus. We used χ2 tests to assess associations between sleep variables and categorical baseline characteristics. Crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from univariate logistic regression models to characterize the magnitude of the relationship between sleep characteristics and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. For associations significant in univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was used to explore further the association of sleep characteristics with pregnancy outcomes.Results: In all, 901 eligible women consented to participate; 782 submitted valid actigraphy studies. Short sleep duration and a later sleep midpoint were associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.53; and odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.36, respectively) but not of hypertensive disorders. A model with both sleep duration and sleep midpoint as well as their interaction term revealed that while there was no significant interaction between these exposures, the main effects of both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.19; and adjusted odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.97, respectively). Additionally, after adjusting separately for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity, both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint remained associated with gestational diabetes. No associations were demonstrated between the sleep quality measures (wake after sleep onset, sleep fragmentation) and hypertensive disorders or gestational diabetes.Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a relationship between short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes. Our data suggest independent contributions of these 2 sleep characteristics to the risk for gestational diabetes in nulliparous women.","2017-10","2019-02-14 12:30:58","2019-02-14 12:30:58","","447.e1-447.e13","","4","217","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Adult; Human; United States; Young Adult; Funding Source; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Epidemiology; Population; Insomnia -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Epidemiology; Actigraphy; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with 1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia, defined as 1-h OGTT values ≥130 mg/dL.Results: Mean nighttime sleep duration was 6.9±0.9 h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r=-0.28, P=.03).

However, prevalence of OSA in GDM women, its relationship to metabolic control, and predictive factors have not been studied.Material and Methods: Eighty-two obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation participated. The Berlin questionnaire was used to assess OSA symptoms. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained. Those with OSA underwent meal tolerance test (MTT) to assess their metabolic parameters. Classification tree analysis was used to develop a screening tool for OSA.Results: At a median gestational age of 29 weeks, OSA was diagnosed in 52.4% of the women, with a median apnea hypopnea index of 9.4 (interquartile range 6.4, 12.4). More severe OSA was significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose but not HbA1c. For those with OSA, sleep parameters related to oxygen desaturation significantly correlated with higher fasting insulin resistance and more severe β-cell dysfunction, as evaluated by MTT. A screening tool involving two variables, neck circumference and Berlin Questionnaire score, was developed. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 51%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 70%.Conclusion: OSA is prevalent in obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM in the late second to early third trimester. OSA severity, especially the degree of oxygen desaturation, correlated with fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and β-cell function. A simple screening tool involving the Berlin Questionnaire and neck circumference can aid in predicting OSA in this patient group.","2017-11","2019-02-14 12:31:00","2019-02-14 12:31:00","","101-107","","","39","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Diagnosis; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Prevalence; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Epidemiology; Obesity -- Complications; Sensitivity and Specificity; Polysomnography -- Equipment and Supplies; Insulin Resistance; Blood Glucose -- Metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Diet Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pathophysiological sequelae include sympathetic activation, increased oxidative stress and a generalized inflammatory response, culminating in endothelial dysfunction. These are the proposed mechanisms that mediate the increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease among patients with OSA outside of pregnancy. It is intriguing to consider the consequences of these events on pregnancy outcomes. There is a growing literature on the impact of maternal OSA on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes and impaired fetal growth. The data, while promising, require confirmation with larger numbers to verify the findings. OSA may be an important mediator of the poor perinatal outcomes associated with maternal obesity; moreover, one which may be amenable to treatment.

The goal of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality. DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: A nationally representative sample of maternal hospital discharges from 1998-2009. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: The analytic sample included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000; however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9), eclampsia (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5-10.9), and pulmonary embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4-11.5). The adverse effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may improve pregnancy outcomes in this group. CITATION: Louis JM, Mogos MF, Salemi JL, Redline S, Salihu HM.

Infants have both anatomical and physiological predispositions toward airway obstruction and gas exchange abnormalities; including a superiorly placed larynx, increased chest wall compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and ventilatory control instability. Congenital abnormalities of the airway, such as laryngomalacia, hemangiomas, pyriform aperture stenosis, choanal atresia, and laryngeal webs, may also have adverse effects on airway patency. Additional exacerbating factors predisposing infants toward airway collapse include neck flexion, airway secretions, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea in infants has been associated with failure to thrive, behavioral deficits, and sudden infant death. The proper interpretation of infant polysomnography requires an understanding of normative data related to gestation and postconceptual age for apnea, arousal, and oxygenation. Direct visualization of the upper airway is an important diagnostic modality in infants with obstructive apnea. Treatment options for infant obstructive sleep apnea are predicated on the underlying etiology, including supraglottoplasty for severe laryngomalacia, mandibular distraction for micrognathia, tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, choanal atresia repair, and/or treatment of gastroesophageal reflux.","2012-04-15","2019-02-14 12:31:03","2019-02-14 12:31:03","","805-816","","8","185","","American Journal of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Infant; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Therapy; Treatment Outcomes; Male; Severity of Illness Indices; Risk Assessment; Incidence; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Etiology; Craniofacial Abnormalities -- Complications; Polysomnography -- Methods; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Physiopathology; Combined Modality Therapy; Adenoidectomy; Adenoids -- Pathology; Craniofacial Abnormalities -- Diagnosis; Hypertrophy -- Pathology; Hypertrophy -- Surgery; Laryngomalacia; Laryngomalacia -- Complications; Larynx -- Abnormalities; Micrognathism -- Complications; Micrognathism -- Diagnosis; Tonsil -- Pathology; Tonsillectomy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to examine the association between OSA and adverse maternal outcomes in a national cohort.Methods: The National Perinatal Information Center in the US was used to identify women with a delivery discharge diagnosis of OSA from 2010 to 2014. We used the International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision to classify OSA diagnosis and maternal outcomes.Measurements: The sample consisted of 1,577,632 gravidas with a rate of OSA of 0.12% (N = 1963). There was a significant association between OSA and preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94-2.54), eclampsia (aOR 2.95, 1.08-8.02), and gestational diabetes (aOR 1.51, 1.34-1.72) after adjusting for a comprehensive list of covariates which includes maternal obesity. OSA status was also associated with a 2.5-3.5-fold increase in risk of severe complications such as cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer (5.1 + 5.6 vs 3.0 + 3.0 days, p < 0.001) and odds of an admission to an intensive care unit higher (aOR 2.74, 2.36-3.18) in women with OSA.Conclusions: Compared to pregnant women without OSA, pregnant women with OSA have a significantly higher risk of pregnancy-specific complications such as gestational hypertensive conditions and gestational diabetes, and rare medical and surgical complications such as cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. OSA diagnosis was also associated with a longer hospital stay and significantly increased odds for admission to the intensive care unit.","2017-10","2019-02-14 12:31:05","2019-02-14 12:31:05","","50-57","","","38","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; Human; United States; Pregnancy Complications -- Therapy; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Complications; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Therapy; Funding Source; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Comorbidity; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Epidemiology; Length of Stay; Critical Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Controls were screened for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) at the time of delivery using a questionnaire. Women at low risk for OSA were selected. Marker levels were adjusted for gestational age and race and reported as multiples of median and later adjusted for body mass index (BMI).Results: Twenty-four OSA cases and 166 controls were identified.

The relationship between OSA and outcomes of interest were explored in stratified and multivariate models controlling for potential confounders. The overall prevalence of OSA was 25.4%. Given a nonlinear increase by body mass index (BMI) strata (8.9%, 46%; p<0.0001), stratified multivariate analysis was subsequently performed.

The present review presents the evidence of current literature and questions whether an early diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy can reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Recent Findings: Although pathophysiological pathways remain to be more clearly defined, recent studies shed light on the association of sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. For the first time, a recent prospective study revealed that obstructive sleep apnea increases over the course of pregnancy and that it is common during the third trimester. In this study, age and BMI have been identified as independent predictors of gestational obstructive sleep apnea. Summary: An association between sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia has been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment during pregnancy on hypertension and preeclampsia. Further studies are required to ascertain whether continuous positive airway pressure can be a useful adjunct treatment for pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia.","2014-11","2019-02-14 12:31:09","2019-02-14 12:31:09","","588-594","","6","20","","Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Complications; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Therapy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Risk Factors; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Physiopathology; Pregnancy Complications -- Physiopathology; Pregnancy Complications -- Prevention and Control; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Physiopathology; Pre-Eclampsia -- Etiology; Early Diagnosis; Anoxia -- Complications; Anoxia -- Physiopathology; Pre-Eclampsia -- Physiopathology; Anoxia -- Therapy; Pre-Eclampsia -- Prevention and Control; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Etiology; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to: 1) describe differences in pattern characteristics of limited channel EEG, and 2) evaluate changes in brain wave signal variability with quantification of cyclicity by spectral density distribution before and after standard morphine administration.Method: This within-subject naturalistic experiment acquired EEG data by limited channel amplitude-integrated (aEEG) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Participants were recruited in two phases: 1) medically stable (n=16, 28-32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) and 2) critically ill receiving morphine for pain or sedation (n=9, 26-39 weeks PMA). The first phase established feasibility, the second employed aEEG to describe brain function before and after opioid administration. Amplitude-integrated EEG signal was quantified by measures of bandwidth voltage, lower border voltage, and variance of each with two simple quantitative measures of peak counts 10 microV above baseline, and proportion of time below 10 microV. Further analysis presented frequency changes across time to describe morphine effect on EEG spectral measures in younger infants who received morphine in the NICU.Results: Less mature infants had higher peak counts and more time at low voltage within epoch: median peak counts 3.625 (SD1.740), median proportion less than 10 microV 22% (SD 0.200). Except for spectral edge frequency (SEF50), morphine effect did not emerge until focused analysis included mini-bands (2Hz) of spectral power. Moreover, the log transformed 'mini-band' of 14-16 Hz showed a significant difference in mean rank (n=9, chi 2 = 5.444, df=1, p<.020) between 15 minutes prior and 60 minutes after the dose. Younger infants demonstrated high power in lower frequency (delta) bands. Among older infants, shifts within the spectrum after morphine administration were observed from high frequency bands toward lower frequencies.Conclusion: Description of brain function patterns is quantifiable. Although morphine effects may be masked by the heavy presence of power in the delta range early in gestation, exploration of spectral densities offers a framework for understanding shifts of spectral frequencies in premature infant brain function.","2012-01","2019-02-14 12:31:12","2019-02-14 12:31:12","","","110 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Washington","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3521568","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Human; Infant, Newborn; Descriptive Statistics; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Electroencephalography; Brain -- Drug Effects -- In Infancy and Childhood; Brain -- Physiology -- In Infancy and Childhood; Narcotics -- Therapeutic Use -- In Infancy and Childhood; Pain -- Drug Therapy -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main exclusion criteria were receiving opioids for chronic pain, nonopioid drugs within 2 days prior to surgery, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, sleep apnoea obstruction syndrome, morbid obesity, severe hepatic impairment, cognitive dysfunction.Interventions: Assays of plasma concentrations of morphine and metabolites (morphine 3-glucuronide and morphine 6-glucuronide) were performed and common polymorphisms in four candidate genes [OPRM1 A118G rs1799971; P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) T3435C (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582); COMT Val 158 Met (rs4680)] were analysed.Morphine was titrated by staff in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) and in the ward patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was used for 24 h.Main Outcome Measures: The dose of morphine required to achieve pain relief and the influence of SNP in genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and kinetics on morphine dose requirements. Secondary endpoints were the concentrations of morphine, morphine 6-glucuronide and morphine 3-gluguronide, the proportion of patients requiring a rescue analgesic and the proportion of morphine-related adverse events.Results: A total of 404 patients completed the study to final analysis. The mean ± SD morphine dose to achieve pain relief was 15.8 ± 8.8 mg in the PACU and 22.7 ± 18.6 mg during patient-controlled intravenous administration.

Here, we report determination of the ontogeny of these transporters and of NaP(i)2 and SGLT1, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to determine expression levels of transporter genes in rat embryonic kidneys on each day of gestation from embryonic day (ed) 13 to ed18, in cultures of induced and uninduced metanephric mesenchyme (MM), and on each day of 1 week of whole embryonic kidney (WEK) culture. We also examined ontogeny of Oat1 protein expression in rat embryonic kidney by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we used uptake of fluorescein (FL) as a novel in vitro functional assay of OAT expression in WEK and MM. Developmental induction of OAT and OCT genes does not occur uniformly: some genes are induced early (e.g., Oat1 and Oat3, potential early markers of proximal tubulogenesis), and others after kidney development is relatively advanced (e.g., Oct1, a potential marker of terminal differentiation). The ontogeny of transporter genes in WEK and MM is similar to that observed in vivo, indicating that these organ culture systems may represent convenient in vitro models to study the developmental induction of OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs. Functional transport was evidenced by accumulation of FL in the developing tubule in WEK and MM organ cultures. Our findings on the renal ontogeny of OATs and OCTs could carry implications both for the development of more rational therapeutics for premature infants, as well as for our understanding of proximal tubule differentiation.","2006-03","2019-02-14 12:31:13","2019-02-14 12:31:13","","837-845","","5","69","","Kidney International","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Funding Source; Gene Expression; Animal Studies; Models, Biological; Rats; Anions; Carrier Proteins -- Metabolism; Cations; Immunohistochemistry; In Vitro Studies; In Vivo Studies; Kidney -- Embryology; Nucleotides; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis; Tissue Culture Techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report on a 30-year-old woman affected with OMD with a 12-year follow-up. Focal dystonia involved an involuntary activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles causing forceful jaw displacement in the maximal protrusive position. These episodes initially occurred during jaw function and increased up to an open-lock with bilateral pre-auricular pain. Dystonic spasms were absent during sleep and were reduced temporarily by sensory tricks. Treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was performed during three different sessions over a 1-year period. Electromyographic-guided BTX injections into the lateral pterygoid muscles were given with cannula electrodes. Botox reduced the involuntary activity of the muscles. Recurrence and exacerbation of dystonic symptoms occurred during the two pregnancies and completely disappeared immediately after both deliveries with prolonged symptom-free periods. During the last 8 years, the patient had a slight relapse of symptoms during flu attacks, periods of stress and during menses. The temporal pattern of these symptoms indicates a possible relationship between OMD and hormonal factors.","2009-12","2019-02-14 12:31:14","2019-02-14 12:31:14","","916-921","","12","36","","Journal of Oral Rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Adult; Basal Ganglia Diseases -- Physiopathology; Hormones -- Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In case of preterm birth, the infant is vulnerable in the neonatal intensive care unit because of its immature and rapidly developing neurologic system. Therefore, developmental care interventions (DCI) are particularly important during the NICU hospitalization to optimize short and long-term outcomes, as well as neurodevelopment, in infants born prematurely. The aim of this article is to provide a narrative overview by summarizing findings of a thorough literature review on the latest findings regarding the effectiveness of six DCI on preterm infant's outcomes such as sleep, stress and neurodevelopment. Various DCI have been evaluated in empirical studies. Research related to these interventions is rapidly evolving but is still a priority in the neonatal research field.","2019-02","2019-02-14 12:31:16","2019-02-14 12:31:16","","3-8","","1","25","","Journal of Neonatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Patient Positioning; Sleep; Breast Feeding; Infant, Premature; Infant Development; Intensive Care, Neonatal; Family Centered Care; Activities of Daily Living; Environment; Developmental Disabilities -- Nursing; Developmental Disabilities -- Therapy; Pain Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a cross-sectional design for our study. Methods: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted among nonpregnant women 16-40 years old from southeast Texas from July 2010 to August 2011. The survey included questions pertaining to demographics, pregnancy intentions, health behaviors, sexual behaviors, violence exposure, pregnancy coercion, and psychological behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine differences between ambivalent and nonambivalent females. Results: Of the 1,388 women included in this analysis, 529 (38%) were ambivalent toward pregnancy. Ambivalent women were younger ( p=0.03), had fewer children living at home ( p<0.01), and were less likely to have been previously pregnant ( p=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that ambivalent women were more likely to smoke ( p<0.01), sleep poorly ( p=0.02), have had more sexual partners in the past month ( p<0.01) and in their lifetime ( p=0.01), not used contraception at last sex ( p=0.01), be a victim of violence ( p=0.01), and have experienced pregnancy coercion ( p<0.01). In addition, these women exhibited higher scores on scales measuring depressive symptoms ( p=0.01) and perceived stress ( p<0.01). Conclusions: Women ambivalent toward pregnancy are not only less likely to use contraception but also more likely to have unhealthy behaviors and psychological risk factors. As this combination of characteristics may put a future pregnancy and child at risk, awareness about the possible consequences of pregnancy ambivalence needs to increase among the public and medical community. Providers need to focus efforts on screening for this patient population and preventive education through contraceptive counseling.","2015-01","2019-02-14 12:31:17","2019-02-14 12:31:17","","37-41","","1","24","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Human; Age Factors; Health Behavior; Depression; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Psychological Tests; Scales; Self Report; T-Tests; Correlational Studies; Confidence Intervals; Sleep Disorders; Attitude to Pregnancy; P-Value; Women; Parity; Smoking; Stress, Psychological; Multiple Linear Regression; Multiple Logistic Regression; Texas; Coercion; Contraception -- Utilization; Crime Victims; Cross Sectional Studies -- Texas; Predictive Validity; Sexual Partners","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We studied 163 adoptees in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in comparison with 5624 nonadopted ATN participants (aged 1.5-17.6 years; mean [SD] = 6.2 [3.4] years). Gender, age, race, ethnicity, IQ, and categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, ASD diagnosis were tested for differences by group (adopted versus nonadopted) by using independent-samples t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic or linear regression models were used to examine the association between adoption status and several outcome variables, after controlling for covariates. RESULTS: After controlling for demographics and diagnosis, there were significant differences in group characteristics, including greater propensity for externalizing behavior (P < .001), internalizing behavior (P = .001), and sleep problems (P < .001) in the adopted population. Adoptees were also prescribed psychotropic medications (P < .001) more often than the nonadoptees. Adoptees received a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder--not otherwise specified significantly more frequently than controls (odds ratio = 1.8; CI = 1.3-2.5; P < .001), despite no significant difference in symptoms on standardized measures. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the population of adopted children with ASD differs from the general ASD population both with regard to diagnostic subtype and co-occurring behavioral problems. Future research should evaluate the contributions of specific factors associated with adoption such as biological family history, pregnancy history, early childhood experience, and age at adoption.","2016-02-02","2019-02-14 12:31:18","2019-02-14 12:31:18","","S90-S97","","","137","","Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Child; Logistic Regression; Adolescence; Human; Canada; United States; Funding Source; Male; Data Analysis Software; Fisher's Exact Test; Scales; T-Tests; Confidence Intervals; Sleep Disorders; Clinical Assessment Tools; Checklists; Linear Regression; Child, Preschool; Child Behavior Checklist; Autistic Disorder -- Diagnosis; Autistic Disorder -- Symptoms; Child, Adopted; Executive Function; Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pelvic girdle pain can have a marked impact on an individual's quality of life, sleep and functional activities, and can result in absenteeism from work. Part 1 of this paper presented the quantitative results of a mixed-methods service evaluation of the introduction of a manual therapy approach to usual care. There is a paucity of literature on patients' experience of receiving manual therapy for PGP during pregnancy. Therefore, the second aim of the service evaluation was to gain an insight into women's experiences of manual therapy treatment for PGP. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with seven women who had received manual therapy, and thematic framework analysis was applied to the data. Qualitative analysis revealed five distinct themes: living with PGP; practicalities of entering the physiotherapy system; patient expectation pre-treatment; response to manual therapy; and relationship with physiotherapist. Overall, women reported reduced pain and improved function after receiving manual therapy alongside usual care.","2017-09","2019-02-14 12:31:21","2019-02-14 12:31:21","","9-22","","121","","","Journal of Pelvic, Obstetric & Gynaecological Physiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Semi-Structured Interview; Quality of Life; Attitude to Illness; Multimethod Studies; Pelvic Pain -- In Pregnancy; Physical Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods 750 consecutive pregnant women attending the first communal ultrasound examination before gestational week 14 were invited to participate. Questionnaires assessing HRQoL (15D), depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale, EPDS), medical, obstetric, and socioeconomic status were handed out. The participants were divided into three groups according to their satisfaction with their financial status, (unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, and satisfied). Main outcome measures were 15D and EPDS-scores and dimensions of HRQoL. Results 325 (43,3%) questionnaires were returned. The mean 15D-score for HRQoL was 0,926 (SD 0,056). The financially unsatisfied women had lower HRQoL than women in more satisfied groups (0.906, 0.923 and 0.931, p = 0.012). The result remained significant, even after adjusting for age and education(p = 0.032). The unsatisfied women had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (25.4, 24.4 and 23.2 kg/m, p for linearity = 0.002), were more often smokers, (13 vs. 4 and 3%, p = 0.029), and had experienced at least one abortion (18, 14 and 7%, p = 0.017). Dimensions of depression, distress and sleep explained the differences between the groups. 27% of unsatisfied women scored EPDS ≥10 points suggesting increased risk of depression. Conclusions Financial satisfaction in early pregnancy associates with HRQoL and risk of perinatal depressive symptoms. Unsatisfied women more often have risk factors for unfavourable pregnancy outcomes which may influence the later health and wellbeing of the mother and child.","2017-07","2019-02-14 12:31:22","2019-02-14 12:31:22","","1493-1499","","7","21","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; T-Tests; Correlation Coefficient; Confidence Intervals; Surveys; Socioeconomic Factors; Finland; Quality of Life -- In Pregnancy; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Depression -- Symptoms -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In pregnant women with a mental disorder, who frequently suffer from sleep problems, it is unknown whether predominantly objective or subjective sleep quality is more affected. To clarify this, we compared objective and subjective parameters of sleep quality between patients and healthy controls during pregnancy. METHODS: This observational study was embedded in an ongoing study among pregnant women with a mental disorder at the department of Psychiatry of Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We compared 21 pregnant women with a confirmed mental disorder with 33 healthy controls (gestational age, 23-29 weeks). To measure objective parameters of sleep quality, all participants continuously wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days and nights. Subjective sleep quality was retrospectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and on a daily basis with the Subjective Sleep Quality-scale (SSQ). Differences in parameters of sleep between patients and controls were tested using a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for parity, gestational age, educational level, and employment status. RESULTS: Objective parameters of sleep quality and subjective sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Daily sleep reports showed that, relative to controls, patients had a significantly worse average SSQ-score (5.2 vs. 7.6, adjusted [beta] = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.03-0.53, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory study suggests that perceived sleep quality reported on a daily basis by pregnant women with a mental disorder is worse than the sleep quality as measured by wrist actigraphy.

Certain risk factors, such as non-cephalic presentation, have a particularly high risk of complications. This qualitative study describes experiences around non-cephalic births and highlights existing perceptions and care-seeking behavior specific to non-cephalic presentation in rural Sarlahi District, Nepal.Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 34 individuals, including women who recently gave birth to a non-cephalic infant and female decision-makers in their households. We also conducted two focus groups with mothers (have two or more children, with at least one child under age five) and two focus groups with grandmothers in the community.Results: Several women described scenes of obstructed labor and practices like provision of unspecified injections early in labor to assist with the delivery. There were reports of arduous care-seeking processes from primary health centers to tertiary facilities, and mixed quality of care among home birth attendants and facility-based health workers respectively. Very few women were aware of the fetal presentation prior to delivery, and we identified no consistent understanding among participants of the risks of and care strategies for non-cephalic births. Risk perception around non-cephalic presentation varied widely. Some participants were acutely aware of potential dangers, while others had not heard of non-cephalic birth. Many interviewees said that the position in which a pregnant woman sleeps could impact the fetal position. Several participants had either taken or heard of medication intended to rotate the fetus into the correct position.Conclusions: Our findings suggest the mixed quality of and access to care associated with non-cephalic birth and a lack of consistent understanding of the risk of and care for non-cephalic births in rural Nepal. The high risk of the condition and the recommended tertiary care present a dilemma in low-resource settings; the logistical difficulties and the mixed quality of care make care-seeking and referral decisions complex. While public health stakeholders strive to improve the quality of and access to the formal health system, those players must also be sensitive to the potential negative implications of promoting institutional care-seeking.","2018-04-10","2019-02-14 12:31:24","2019-02-14 12:31:24","","89-89","","1","18","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Labor -- Psychosocial Factors; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Middle Age; Comparative Studies; Aged; Rural Population; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Qualitative Studies; Focus Groups; Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index; Impact of Events Scale; Patient Attitudes; Nepal; Prenatal Care -- Psychosocial Factors; Perception; Delivery, Obstetric -- Psychosocial Factors; Labor Presentation; Quality of Health Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A majority (84%) of depressed pregnant women would consider using a complementary health approach for weight and/or stress management during pregnancy, and more than 50% were interested in yoga.","2017-01","2019-02-14 12:31:25","2019-02-14 12:31:25","","81-95","","1","22","","Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary & Alternative Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Anxiety; Surveys; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Alternative Therapies; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Support, Psychosocial; Stress; Mindfulness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a minimum level of health care that every person with diabetes should expect. In 2010, Diabetes UK produced a list of 15 essential checks and services that people with diabetes should expect to receive. We wanted to assess whether we were adequately achieving all of these targets in our own diabetes service and assess whether the targets were themselves adequate and appropriate. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 200 randomly selected patients attending the diabetes review clinic in a district general hospital. We recorded whether the parameters outlined in the Diabetes UK '15 health care essentials' had been achieved in the last 12 months and then collated the data. The data showed that we scored well in terms of monitoring HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index, retinal screening and cholesterol. However, we scored sub-optimally in terms of the following parameters: smoking cessation, pregnancy planning, structured education, measurement of waist circumference and psychological assessment. In conclusion, the Diabetes UK 'essentials' checklist may be viewed as mechanistic, but it provides a useful starting point to assess the effectiveness of a diabetes service in providing the basics of patient care in much the same way as the WHO surgical checklist reduces adverse outcomes. We have been able to see where the deficiencies in our own service lie and have made amends to ensure that these areas are covered in future. One issue that arose is that there are certain other 'essentials' that would be good to include in such a checklist, such as: erectile dysfunction (as suggested by the NICE guidelines), obstructive sleep apnoea, vitamin D deficiency, neuropathy screening and monitoring of liver function to rule out incipient steatohepatitis/fatty liver disease.

The associations of perinatal and early childhood behaviours and socio-economic factors with overweight or obesity were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Adjusted population attributable risk fractions (PARFs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models.Results: Of 968 term-born children, 21% were overweight and another 13% were obese. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.15) was positively associated with obesity. This association was mediated by birth weight (suppression effect); once controlled, the strength of the association between smoking and child obesity increased by 12%. Birth weight per 100 g (1.05; 1.005-1.09) was significantly associated with obesity. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (0.44; 0.31-0.61), adequate sleep hours (0.39; 0.16-0.94) and being physically active (0.50; 0.26-0.93) were found to be protective. Breastfeeding, whether exclusive or not, significantly reduced obesity risk among children whose mothers never smoked in pregnancy. PARFs indicated that 24.4%, 11.5%, 11.3% and 6.0% prevalent cases of child obesity might be prevented by exclusive breastfeeding, smoking cessation during pregnancy, adequate sleep during childhood, and avoiding high birth weight, respectively.Conclusions: This study identified multiple perinatal and childhood factors associated with obesity in young Canadian children.

Research shows that about 20% of homeless young women become pregnant (Bender, & Thompson, 2007). These pregnant young women are at an increased risk for low birth weight infants and a high infant mortality due to inadequate health care, poor dietary habits, and a knowledge deficit related to maintaining good health during pregnancy and to care of the infant and growing child. A transitional shelter may offer many psychosocial services to assist the women in becoming independent; however, a significant gap exists regarding the medical care of this population. The purpose of this DNP Project was to develop an educational program in a transitional homeless shelter focused on the health care of the pregnant woman and the newborn infant in order to bring awareness of the special needs of this high risk population and to attempt to change unhealthy behaviors. This program was coupled with an In- Service Program for staff members related to Best Practices for the Mother- Infant Dyad. Significance of the project: Knowledge can be empowering and save lives. Through months of interaction and time spent with new mothers in a transitional shelter, the enormous lack of evidence based practices in regards to infant and child care has become evident. This vulnerable population has the highest rate of infant mortality. Education can improve the health outcomes of these women and children. These mothers are eager to learn and want to give their children a chance for a healthy life. They are lacking the information to do so. Methods: The project was implemented in a transitional homeless shelter for women ages 18 to 23 based on a needs assessment. The project implementation contained two parts. Informal education sessions took place with pregnant women and women having recently given birth. 10 Education Intervention Program There were both individual and group sessions. The topics included labor and delivery preparation, diet during pregnancy, care of the newborn, and safety issues related to sleep and feedings. As the infants have grown over the months the sessions have evolved to meet the needs of the growing infant and child. The second part of the project contains a series of learning modules comprising of four hours of narrated lectures and power point presentations developed for the staff. Project Outcomes: The project initiatives were received by all involved wholeheartedly. The project brought to the shelter directors and staff members a new awareness of the crucial need for evidenced based practice in the care of the newborn and mother. Clinical observations have shown a readiness for several of the mothers to follow lessons learned. Significant changes in behaviors related to care of the infant have been observed. A level of trust has developed between the educator and the residents of the shelter. The educator has assumed the role of advocate and mentor. Clinical Relevance: Women head up 90 percent of the families that use shelters. A third of the homeless are women and children, and the numbers are exploding. Through education, advocacy and developing a means of quality health care the lives of these women and children will be made better and healthier. A best practice model for care of the pregnant homeless women and her infant is needed.","2015-01","2019-02-14 12:31:28","2019-02-14 12:31:28","","1-1","","","","","Perinatal Health Education Intervention for Adolescent & Young Adult Pregnant Homeless Women Living in Transitional Housing & Best Practice Teaching Intervention Program For Staff Responsible For Care of the Mother-Baby Dyad","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adolescence; Human; Health Knowledge; Young Adult; Program Evaluation; Patient Safety; Perinatal Care; Diet -- In Pregnancy; Health Education -- In Pregnancy; Homelessness; Obstetric Care -- Education; Residential Facilities; Staff Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings in this area conflict and much of the research relies on poor measures of sleep and/or depression. Adding to this complexity is the rise in antidepressant treatment for perinatal maternal depression and no previous study has examined the relationship between such exposure and infant sleep.Methods: This study draws on four waves of data (early pregnancy and third trimester, and six and 12 months postpartum) from 264 women in the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort study of women recruited in early pregnancy in Melbourne, Australia. Cross-lagged regression models were used to examine reciprocity of longitudinal effects between depressive symptoms and infant sleep.Results: Maternal antepartum depression and antidepressant use were not significant predictors of infant sleep problems. Likewise, infant sleep problems were not significant predictors of postpartum maternal depression. However, maternal cognitions about infant sleep, characterised by maternal expectations to immediately attend to their crying child, did demonstrate positive reciprocal effects with infant nocturnal waking between six and 12 months postpartum.Limitations: Infant sleep outcomes were reported by the mother and the sample were predominantly Anglophone, restricting generalizability of the models to other cultures.Conclusions: Maternal depression and antidepressant use were not found to be significant factors in infant sleep problems and, likewise, infant sleep problems were not associated with maternal depression. However, postpartum maternal cognitions around six months postpartum regarding limit-setting at night may predict increases in later nocturnal infant signaling.","2018-10","2019-02-14 12:31:29","2019-02-14 12:31:29","","218-225","","","238","","Journal of Affective Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Infant; Adult; Human; Australia; Comparative Studies; Insomnia -- Psychosocial Factors; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Infant Behavior; Depression, Postpartum -- Psychosocial Factors; Maternal Behavior; Postnatal Period -- Psychosocial Factors; Antidepressive Agents -- Administration and Dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women underwent an overnight sleep study using a portable home monitor. Studies were manually scored by a central masked sleep reading center using American Academy of Sleep Medicine diagnostic criteria. An apnea hypopnea index of 5 or more was considered diagnostic of OSA. Perinatal outcomes were compared between women with and without OSA.Results: Among 175 women, OSA prevalence was 15.4% (13 mild, 9 moderate, 5 severe). Compared with no OSA (apnea hypopnea index less than 5), the OSA group had a higher BMI (46.8±12.2 compared with 38.1±7.5; P=.002) and more chronic hypertension (55.6% compared with 32.4%, P=.02).

A total of 823 children who had been diagnosed with OSAS were designated as the case group, and 823 children without OSAS were selected with strict criteria to match with the case group by age, gender and body mass index. Logistic regression models were used to determine the perinatal factors associated with childhood OSAS.Results: Preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-3.08) and cesarean section (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.68) were significantly associated with OSAS.

It has also been linked to negative obstetric consequences. Although high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness throughout pregnancy is well-documented, neither the causes of persistent daytime sleepiness nor new-onset daytime sleepiness during pregnancy have been investigated. Identifying predictive factors may play an important role in the management of daytime sleepiness in pregnant women and improve prenatal care and maternal-fetal outcomes. Objectives To examine first-trimester maternal characteristics associated with the persistence and new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Design A longitudinal, prospective cohort design. Setting One medical center in Taipei, Taiwan and participating women’s homes. Participants A total of 204 pregnant women. Methods First-trimester pregnant women recruited from an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center provided socio-demographic and health information, wore an actigraphy monitor for 7 days, and completed sleep, mood, and daytime sleepiness questionnaires. Data were collected again when the women were in the second and third trimester. Results Thirty-one (15.2%) women experienced excessive daytime sleepiness that persisted across all three trimesters. Nulliparous women and women who snored in the first trimester were 2.28 and 2.10 times more at risk of being classified of persistent daytime sleepiness than multiparous women and women who did not snore in the first trimester, respectively. Thirty-one (15.2%) women developed new-onset daytime sleepiness with advancing gestation. Women were more likely to develop new-onset daytime sleepiness if they worked longer hours per week (OR = 1.04, p < 0.001), if they reported snoring (OR = 6.75, p < 0.001), and if they had elevated depressive symptoms in the first trimester of pregnancy (OR = 1.09, p = 0.01). Conclusions Snoring in the first trimester is involved in both the persistence and new-onset of daytime sleepiness with elevated depressive symptoms related to new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Findings suggest that intervention strategies for alleviating daytime sleepiness in pregnant women should focus on managing snoring and symptoms of depression in early trimesters with special attention to nulliparous and employed women.","2017-01-15","2019-02-14 12:31:32","2019-02-14 12:31:32","","1-6","","","66","","International Journal of Nursing Studies","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Sleep; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Outpatients; Expectant Mothers; Descriptive Statistics; Taiwan; Prenatal Care; Socioeconomic Factors; Depression -- Symptoms; P-Value; Pregnancy Trimesters; Nonexperimental Studies; Parity; Snoring; Actigraphy; Obstetric Service; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence -- Epidemiology -- In Pregnancy; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence -- Risk Factors -- In Pregnancy; Women, Working; Workload","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study is designed to investigate if somatic symptoms (energy level, appetite, sleep) associated with both pregnancy and depression were responsible for this increased prevalence of minor depression. A sample of pregnant women ( n = 404) was compared to women who were not pregnant ( n = 6754). Both groups scored within the minor depression range on the PHQ-8 and comparisons were based on participants' responses to PHQ-8 items. Results indicate that of the somatic symptoms of depression, only changes in energy level accounted for the elevated prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant. Removing the decreased energy item from the score determination reduces the prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women to a level significantly below that of women who are not pregnant.

Data from the cluster-randomised gestational diabetes mellitus primary prevention trial conducted in maternity clinics were utilised in a secondary analysis. The cases considered were pregnant women who reported engaging in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity per week (active women) ( N = 80), and the controls were women below these recommendations (less active) ( N = 258). All participants had at least one risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Their HRQoL was evaluated via the validated generic instrument 15D, with HRQoL at the end of pregnancy examined in relation to changes in physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression models addressed age, parity, education, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. At the end of pregnancy, the expected HRQoL was higher (tobit regression coefficient 0.022, 95 % CI 0.003-0.042) among active women than less active women. Active women also had greater mobility (OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.04-3.78), ability to handle their usual activities (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.29-3.81), and vitality (OR 2.08, 95 % CI 1.22-3.54) than did less active women. Active women reported higher-quality sleep (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.03-4.30) throughout pregnancy as compared to less active women. Meeting of the physical activity guidelines before pregnancy was associated with better overall HRQoL and components thereof related to physical activity.","2014-11","2019-02-14 12:31:35","2019-02-14 12:31:35","","2098-2105","","9","18","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Funding Source; Confidence Intervals; Prenatal Care; Finland; Quality of Life -- In Pregnancy; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Prevention and Control; Mann-Whitney U Test; Physical Activity -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: We examined the magnitude of associations between objectively measured PA subcomponents and sedentary time with body composition in 4-y-old children. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 398 preschool children recruited from the Southampton Women's Survey. PA was measured by using accelerometry, and body composition was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between light physical activity, moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) intensity; sedentary time; and body composition were analyzed by using repeated-measures linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, birth weight, maternal education, maternal BMI, smoking during pregnancy, and sleep duration. Sedentary time and PA were also mutually adjusted for one another to determine whether they were independently related to adiposity. Results: VPA was the only intensity of PA to exhibit strong inverse associations with both total adiposity [P < 0.001 for percentage of body fat and fat mass index (FMI)] and abdominal adiposity (P = 0.002 for trunk FMI). MVPA was inversely associated with total adiposity (P = 0.018 for percentage of body fat; P = 0.022 for FMI) but only because of the contribution of VPA, because MPA was unrelated to fatness (P ≥ 0.077). No associations were shown between-the lime spent sedentary and body composition (P ≥ 0.11). Conclusions: In preschoolers, the time spent in VPA is strongly and independently associated with lower adiposity. In contrast, the time spent sedentary and in low-to-moderate-intensity PA was unrelated to adiposity. These results indicate that efforts to challenge pediatric obesity may benefit from prioritizing VPA.","2013-05","2019-02-14 12:31:36","2019-02-14 12:31:36","","1020-1028","","5","97","","American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Cross Sectional Studies; Adult; Human; Health Behavior; United Kingdom; Young Adult; Funding Source; Male; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Confidence Intervals; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Analysis of Variance; Repeated Measures; Child Health; Linear Regression; Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; Child, Preschool; Maternal Behavior; Sensitivity and Specificity; Absorptiometry, Photon -- In Infancy and Childhood; Accelerometry -- In Infancy and Childhood; Body Composition -- In Infancy and Childhood; Body Mass Index -- Evaluation; Exercise Intensity -- In Infancy and Childhood; Life Style, Sedentary -- In Infancy and Childhood; Physical Activity -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the relationships between physical activity, sleep quality, and unplanned cesarean section. Methods: This study employed a prospective and descriptive correlational design. A total of 184 pregnant women in their third trimester at 2 medical centers participated in the study. A 3-day physical activity scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to evaluate, respectively, physical activity-related energy expenditures and sleep quality. Results: Subjects had a comparatively low level of energy expenditure on physical activity and performed a lower than normal amount of moderate-to-heavy physical activity. Three-quarters (77.2%) of subjects had poor sleep quality, and 40.7% reported being unsatisfied with their sleep quality. The main cause of poor sleep quality was sleep disturbance. Using logistic regression, results indicated that the odds of undergoing cesarean section increased to 1.22 (95% CI =1.01 -- 1.48) when sleep quality was 'poor'. By contrast, odds decreased to 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 -- 0.97) when physical activity energy expenditures rose.

Healthy comparison women were matched on the number of weeks pregnant or postpartum. Plasma melatonin levels for each subject were measured every 30 minutes, in dim light (<30 lux), from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. The values of plasma melatonin levels were log-transformed, and calculations were determined for the following measures: baseline and synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. Groups were compared by analyses of covariance, with age, number of weeks pregnant or postpartum, breast-feeding status, and body mass index as covariates.Results: Morning melatonin levels from 2:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. were significantly lower in pregnant women with major depression relative to healthy pregnant women. However, these levels were significantly higher in postpartum women with major depression across time intervals relative to postpartum healthy women. Pregnant but not postpartum women with a personal or family history of depression, regardless of their current diagnosis, had significantly earlier melatonin synthesis and baseline offset times relative to women without a family history of depression. In pregnant healthy women but not pregnant women with major depression, melatonin levels increased during the course of pregnancy. This association was not found among postpartum women with major depression or postpartum healthy women.Conclusions: Plasma nocturnal melatonin concentrations, particularly during morning hours, were lower in depressed pregnant women but elevated in depressed postpartum women relative to matched healthy comparison women. In addition, melatonin timing measures were advanced in pregnant women with a personal or family history of depression.

The drug-exposed infants also spent less time in quiet sleep and more time crying and showing stress behaviors. Both the mothers and the infants in the drug groups demonstrated inferior interactions, and their dopamine and serotonin levels were significantly higher. As early as 3 months (following 3 months of intervention), the drug rehab mothers and their infants looked more like the nondrug group in their interactions; by 6 months, they looked similar on virtually every measure. At 12 months, the infants of drug rehab mothers (versus the drug control group) had superior Early Social Communication Scale scores and Bayley Mental scale scores, as well as significantly greater head circumference and fewer pediatric complications. The drug rehab mothers also improved on several lifestyle variables. They demonstrated a lower incidence of continued drug use and repeat pregnancy, and a greater number continued school, received a high school or general equivalency diploma, or were placed in a job. Thus, a relatively cost-effective high school based intervention had positive effects on both adolescent mothers who had used drugs and their infants.","1998","2019-02-14 12:31:52","2019-02-14 12:31:52","","117-117","","129","33","","Adolescence","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Adolescence; Human; Infant, Newborn; Scales; Cost Benefit Analysis; Child Development; Pregnancy in Adolescence; Mother-Child Relations; Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale; Early Childhood Intervention; Pregnancy Complications -- Rehabilitation; School Health Services; Substance Use Disorders -- Rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sleep quality and duration during early pregnancy were self-reported by enrolled women at their first antenatal care visit before 16 weeks of gestation. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was assessed with a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Information about self-reported sleep quality and duration in mid-pregnancy were also collected at this time. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated by multivariable logistic regression models, and adjusted for potential confounders to estimate the effect of poor sleep quality and the interaction between sleep quality and duration on the development of GDM. Stratified analyses were performed according to age, parity, family history of diabetes and napping.Results: A total of 335 (8.2%) participants were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality was reported in 259 (6.4%) women during early pregnancy and 248 (6.1%) in mid-pregnancy. The risk of GDM was increased in women with poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20-2.61).

This longitudinal study investigated the relationship between sleep variables and postpartum depression symptoms using wrist actigraphy and self-report surveys. Twenty-five healthy primiparous women were recruited from their outpatient obstetricians’ offices from July 2009 through March 2010. Subjects wore wrist actigraphs for 1 week during the third trimester of pregnancy and again during the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th weeks postpartum while completing sleep logs and sleep surveys. Subjective assessments of mood were collected at the end of each actigraph week. Subjective sleep assessments were strongly predictive of depression severity scores as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) across all weeks ( p < 0.001). Actigraphic measures of sleep maintenance, such as sleep fragmentation, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset, were also significantly correlated with EPDS scores postpartum. However, there was no relationship between nocturnal sleep duration and EPDS scores. This study provides additional evidence that poor sleep maintenance as measured by wrist actigraphy, rather than lesser amounts of sleep, is associated with EPDS scores during the postpartum period and that subjective assessments of sleep may be more accurate predictors of postpartum depression symptoms than wrist actigraphy. It also supports the hypothesis that disrupted sleep may contribute to the development and extent of postpartum depression symptoms.","2013-12","2019-02-14 12:31:53","2019-02-14 12:31:53","","539-547","","6","16","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Sleep Disorders -- Diagnosis; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Self Report; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Correlational Studies; Primiparas; Analysis of Variance; Diaries; Repeated Measures; Sleep Disorders -- Complications; Post Hoc Analysis; Two-Tailed Test; Polysomnography -- Equipment and Supplies; Depression, Postpartum -- Risk Factors; Step-Wise Multiple Regression; Research Question; Severity of Illness -- Evaluation; Sleep Disorders -- Symptoms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In turn, inflammation is a causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the United States, a persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans showing ∼1.5 times greater risk. This study examined associations among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women.Design: Observational.Measurements: Women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other psychosocial and behavioral measures during midpregnancy. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined by high-sensitivity assays. Birth outcomes were determined via medical record review.Results: Among African American women (n = 79), shorter gestation was predicted by poorer overall sleep (rs = -0.35, P = 0.002) as well the following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (rs = -0.34, P = 0.002), sleep latency (rs = -0.27, P = 0.02), and sleep efficiency (rs = -0.27, P = 0.02). African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 10.2 times the odds of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among European American women (n = 53), gestational length was not significantly predicted by sleep quality (Ps > 0.12). Bootstrapping analyses showed that, among African Americans, IL-8 significantly mediated the association between sleep quality and length of gestation (indirect effect estimate -0.029; 95% confidence interval -0.06, -0.002).Conclusions: The data provide novel evidence that African American women exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep disturbance than European American women and these effects correspond with length of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep induced immune dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth.","2015-08","2019-02-14 12:31:54","2019-02-14 12:31:54","","1259-1267","","8","38","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several risk factors have been identified, but a gap in the understanding of the underlying etiology of PTB persists. Poor sleep quality is a correlate of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated whether sleep quality during pregnancy was a clinically relevant risk factor for PTB. DESIGN: Observational MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Participants included 166 pregnant women (mean age = 28.6 ± 5.5 years). Self-report questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% CI [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% CI [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07). With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25% in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality, in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed sleep contributes to PTB are unknown. We suggest that poor sleep may contribute to increased risk for PTB both independently, as well as in conjunction with other established risk factors, such as stress.

Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Multivariate logistical regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) after adjusting for putative confounders.Results: Approximately, 17% of women were classified as having poor sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of >5 vs. ≤5). Further, the prevalence of antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively in this cohort. After adjusting for confounders including depression, poor sleep quality was associated with a 2.81-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR=2.81; 95% CI 1.78-4.45). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 28% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (OR=1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.41). The odds of suicidal ideation was particularly high among depressed women with poor sleep quality (OR=13.56 95% CI 7.53-24.41) as compared with women without either risk factor.Limitations: This cross-sectional study utilized self-reported data. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may not be fully generalizable.Conclusion: Poor sleep quality, even after adjusting for depression, is associated with antepartum suicidal ideation.

This paper argues that adverse events during childbirth can act as powerful triggers in the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subsequently, postnatal depression. Drawing on the qualitative data gathered during a mixed method, longitudinal prospective study with childbearing women (n = 499), three case studies are used to illustrate trauma responses to stressful childbirth experiences. Results: Childbirth events involving life threat and personal injury were found to give rise to trauma reactions. Responses included the re-experiencing of the trauma commonly through intrusive thoughts about the birth, avoidance of people, places and thoughts associated with the event, and physiological arousal symptoms that may contribute to sleep difficulties or somatic complaints. Furthermore, the women reported the early onset of trauma symptoms, avoiding contact with the baby, and the experience of depression. Conclusion: Trauma symptoms in the postpartum period may be missed and their relationship to maternal depression may be overlooked. Health professionals need to acknowledge the unique nature of childbirth for each woman and attend to the emotional aspects of care in order to minimize adverse psychosocial consequences.","1999-12","2019-02-14 12:31:57","2019-02-14 12:31:57","","125-130","","4","8","","Birth Issues","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Fetus; Pregnancy; Human; Childbirth -- Psychosocial Factors; Infant, Newborn; Australia; Depression, Postpartum; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Qualitative Studies; Case Studies; Cesarean Section -- Psychosocial Factors; Fetal Distress; Intrapartum Care -- Psychosocial Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic -- Diagnosis -- In Pregnancy; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic -- In Pregnancy; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Vacuum Extraction, Obstetrical -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several potential mechanisms have been proposed, the actual mechanism has not been elucidated.Methods: We investigated outcomes in neonatal lambs exposed prenatally or postnatally to fluoxetine (FX). Daily FX injections (50 mg) were given intravenously (i.v.) to five pregnant ewes via implanted catheters beginning at 131-132 days gestation (term = 147 days) for 2 weeks. In another group, lambs with implanted vascular catheters had sterile water (n = 9) or FX (1 mg/kg, n = 12) injected i.v. on ~postnatal day (PND) 4.Results: Prenatal FX-exposed lambs (n = 7) were hyperactive during PND 4 to 14 and their heart rate variability (HRV) was significantly lower than in control lambs (n = 7) on PND 2. In contrast, arterial pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, arterial blood gases, pH, glucose, lactate, cortisol, and sleep-activity cycles were not altered following postnatal FX injection.Conclusion: This abnormal postnatal hyperactivity with antenatal FX exposure may reflect increased maturity in terms of locomotory activity. The results suggest that altered brain development may be involved in the poor neonatal adaptation in human infants exposed to FX in utero.","2019-02-09","2019-02-14 12:31:58","2019-02-14 12:31:58","","N.PAG","","","","","Pediatric Research","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary objective was to assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered to an individual or group related to infant general health or care and parent-infant relationships. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013). We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post-birth related to the health or care of an infant or parent-infant relationships. Two review authors (JB, CTB) assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports. Of the 27 trials (3949 mothers and 579 fathers) that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) reported useable data. Educational interventions included: five on infant sleep enhancement, 12 on infant behaviour, three on general post-birth health, three on general infant care, and four on infant safety. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only 13 were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these 13 meta-analyses, only four were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect. Education about sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more night-time minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours at six weeks of age (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. However, it had no significant effect on the mean difference in minutes of crying time in 24 hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age. Education related to infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91). The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear. Education related to sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep but appears to have no effect on infant crying time. Education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]","2013-11","2019-02-14 12:31:58","2019-02-14 12:31:58","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","11","","","Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Human; Clinical Trials; Confidence Intervals; Meta Analysis; Infant Care -- Education; Parents -- Education; Outcomes (Health Care); Parent-Infant Relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predictors of postpartum depressive symptoms, including perceived stress, social support, and maternal adjustment were also examined. Another purpose was to compare objective and subjective sleep in mothers with and without depressive symptoms in the third trimester (Time 1) and at 12 weeks postpartum (Time 2).This descriptive, correlational, longitudinal, secondary analysis utilized data from two randomized clinical trials. Depressive symptoms, psychosocial measures, and subjective and objective sleep measures were collected on a sample of 161 first-time mothers between the ages of 18 and 43 years.The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Mean CES-D scores at Time 1 (12.2 +/- 7.0) significantly improved at Time 2 (8.8 +/- 6.7). However, of the 46 women scoring in the depressed range at Time 1, 32.6% (n = 15) continued to experience depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Of the 115 women with minimal symptoms at Time 1, 7% (n = 8) experienced depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance were significantly associated at Time 1 and Time 2. Overall sleep disturbance, minutes to fall asleep, ability to stay asleep, and daytime sleepiness significantly improved from late pregnancy to 12 weeks postpartum. Women with depressive symptoms in the late third trimester and 12 weeks postpartum reported significantly more sleep disturbance, trouble falling asleep and more daytime sleepiness than women without depressive symptoms. Fifty-seven percent of the variance in mothers' depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum was explained by six independent variables. However, antenatal CES-D score alone was a significant predictor of postpartum depression scores, accounting for 16.7% of the variance in depression scores at 12 weeks postpartum.The results of this study underscore the need for health care providers to assess depressive symptoms and sleep during pregnancy and during the first few postpartum months. Furthermore, results suggest that complaints of sleep disturbance, especially prolonged sleep onset latency and increased daytime sleepiness, may be relevant screening questions in relation to risk for postpartum depression.","2007-01","2019-02-14 12:31:59","2019-02-14 12:31:59","","","197 p","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Francisco","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3261263","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Prospective Studies; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Middle Age; Psychological Tests; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Sleep Disorders; Support, Psychosocial; Health Screening; Stress, Psychological; Depression, Postpartum -- Symptoms; Secondary Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since sleep and depression are closely related it is possible that women who suffer from sleep related problems during pregnancy are more likely to develop depression in the postpartum period. This study aims to investigate the possible association between depressive symptoms in the postpartum period and sleep related problems during pregnancy.Methods: In this study 293 women in the last trimester of pregnancy answered a questionnaire about symptoms of restless legs, snoring and daytime sleepiness. They also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The same women were screened for depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) four to ten weeks after giving birth. Additional information about social data, pregnancy and delivery was received from the medical charts.Results: Women with postpartum depressive symptoms had higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness defined as ESS score ≥10 (OR 3.84, CI 1.57-9.39), and restless legs syndrome (OR 2.837 CI 1.18-6.84) in last trimester of pregnancy, when adjusted for socio-demographic factors and obstetric risk factors. No association was found between postpartum depressive symptoms and snoring.Conclusions: Depressive symptoms after childbirth are preceded by sleep related problems such as daytime sleepiness and restless legs, already during pregnancy. The results from Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a questionnaire concerning Restless Legs Syndrome completed during pregnancy might be a valuable contribution for detecting women at risk for postpartum depression, enabling preventive interventions.","2016-06-06","2019-02-14 12:32:00","2019-02-14 12:32:00","","1-8","","","16","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Restless Legs -- Psychosocial Factors; Risk Factors; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Scales; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Depression, Postpartum -- Psychosocial Factors; Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings showed that most of the mothers obtained as many hours of sleep in the postpartum period as they did prior to pregnancy. However, this sleep was subject to many interruptions. All of the subjects felt less rested and complained of tiredness which they ascribed to meeting the needs of their baby rather than with actual reduction in the number of sleep hours.

The aim of the present paper is to identify potential determinants of obesity and risk groups among 3- to 17-year old children and adolescents to provide a basis for effective prevention strategies.Methods: Data were collected in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS), a nationally representative and comprehensive data set on health behaviour and health status of German children and adolescents. Body height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was classified according to IOTF cut-off points. Statistical analyses were conducted on 13,450 non-underweight children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years. The association between overweight, obesity and several potential determinants was analysed for this group as well as for three socio-economic status (SES) groups. A multiple logistic regression model with obesity as the dependent variable was also calculated.Results: The strongest association with obesity was observed for parental overweight and for low SES. Furthermore, a positive association with both overweight (including obesity) and obesity was seen for maternal smoking during pregnancy, high weight gain during pregnancy (only for mothers of normal weight), high birth weight, and high media consumption. In addition, high intakes of meat and sausages, total beverages, water and tea, total food and beverages, as well as energy-providing food and beverages were significantly associated with overweight as well as with obesity. Long sleep time was negatively associated with obesity among 3- to 10-year olds. Determinants of obesity occurred more often among children and adolescents with low SES.Conclusion: Parental overweight and a low SES are major potential determinants of obesity. Families with these characteristics should be focused on in obesity prevention.","2009-01","2019-02-14 12:32:03","2019-02-14 12:32:03","","46-46","","1","9","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Body Mass Index; Child; Cross Sectional Studies; Germany; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Human; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Demography; Socioeconomic Factors; Analysis of Variance; Food Habits; Child, Preschool; Life Style; Multivariate Analysis; Weight Gain; Data Collection; Anthropometry; Adolescent Behavior; Eating; Parent-Child Relations; Pediatric Obesity -- Diagnosis; Pediatric Obesity -- Epidemiology; Probability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later.Conclusions: Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:32:06","2019-02-14 12:32:06","","82-92","","","185","","Drug & Alcohol Dependence","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, however, a growing recognition of the limits of prenatal care and the importance of maternal health before pregnancy has drawn increasing attention to preconception and internatal care. Internatal care refers to a package of healthcare and ancillary services provided to a woman and her family from the birth of one child to the birth of her next child. For healthy mothers, internatal care offers an opportunity for wellness promotion between pregnancies. For high-risk mothers, internatal care provides strategies for risk reduction before their next pregnancy. In this paper we begin to define the contents of internatal care. The core components of internatal care consist of risk assessment, health promotion, clinical and psychosocial interventions. We identified several priority areas, such as FINDS (family violence, infections, nutrition, depression, and stress) for risk assessment or BBEEFF (breastfeeding, back-to-sleep, exercise, exposures, family planning and folate) for health promotion. Women with chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or weight problems should receive on-going care per clinical guidelines for their evaluation, treatment, and follow-up during the internatal period. For women with prior adverse outcomes such as preterm delivery, we propose an internatal care model based on known etiologic pathways, with the goal of preventing recurrence by addressing these biobehavioral pathways prior to the next pregnancy. We suggest enhancing service integration for women and families, including possibly care coordination and home visitation for selected high-risk women. The primary aim of this paper is to start a dialogue on the content of internatal care.","2006-09-02","2019-02-14 12:32:07","2019-02-14 12:32:07","","S107-22","","","10","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Sudden Infant Death -- Prevention and Control; United States; Depression; Funding Source; Health Promotion; Nutrition; Support, Psychosocial; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational; Hypertension; Pregnancy, High Risk; Exercise; Childbirth, Premature; Risk Assessment; Stress, Psychological; Prepregnancy Care; Folic Acid; Immunization; Breast Feeding Promotion; Environmental Exposure -- Prevention and Control; Family Planning; Health Services; Office Visits; Violence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A goal of preconception health research is to use preventive behaviour and healthcare to optimize the health of future offspring that result from both planned and unplanned pregnancies. This paper briefly reviews evidence of the importance of various preconception health behaviours, and examines the extent to which specific preconception health behaviours have been included in recent studies of such knowledge, behaviours, and intentions. To describe this recent research in highly developed countries, a scoping review of the literature was completed of studies published within the past seven years. A total of 94 studies on preconception health were identified and reviewed: (a) 15 examined knowledge and attitudes, (b) 68 studied behaviours, (c) 18 examined interventions designed to improve knowledge or behaviour, and (d) no studies examined intentions to engage in preconception health behaviours. Over 40% of studies examining preconception health behaviour focussed exclusively on folic acid. Overall, folic acid, alcohol, and cigarettes have consistently been topics of focus, while exposure to harmful environmental substances, stress, and sleep have been largely neglected. Despite strong evidence for the importance of men's health during the preconception period, only 11% of all studies included male participants. Based on existing gaps in the research, recommendations are provided, such as including men in future research, assessing a wider variety of behaviours, consideration of behavioural intentions, and consideration of the relationships between preconception health knowledge, intentions, and behaviour.","2017-03","2019-02-14 12:32:07","2019-02-14 12:32:07","","1-15","","","96","","Preventive Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Human; Health Behavior; Male; Attitude to Health; Systematic Review; Smoking; Pregnancy Complications -- Prevention and Control; Scoping Review; Alcohol Drinking; Folic Acid -- Therapeutic Use; Intention; Prepregnancy Care -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study compared the prevalence of modifiable preconception risk factors among women with and without a history of service. Methods Analyses included data from the 2013 and 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Preconception risk factors included health behaviors, chronic conditions, and mental health among women of childbearing age. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to compare the adjusted prevalence of each outcome among women with and without a history of service. Interaction terms assessed variation by age and history of service. Results Compared with women without a history of service, women with a history of service reported higher prevalence of insufficient sleep (49.6% vs. 36.3%; p <.001) and diagnosed depression (26.5% vs. 21.6%; p <.01). Women with a history of service were overall less likely to have obesity (19.8% vs. 26.5%; p <.001). Age-stratified results suggested that, compared with women without a history of service, women with a history of service were more likely to smoke in the 25 to 34 age group and reported comparable levels of obesity in the 35 to 44 age group. Conclusions Women with a history of service demonstrated a preconception health profile that differs from women without a history of service. It is critical that providers are aware of their patients' military status and potential associated risks.","2018-11","2019-02-14 12:32:09","2019-02-14 12:32:09","","539-545","","6","28","","Women's Health Issues","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Health Behavior; Middle Age; Prevalence; Depression -- Diagnosis; Obesity; Women's Health; Maternal Age; Mental Health; Military Services; Smoking; Multiple Logistic Regression; Prepregnancy Care; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: To predict neurodevelopment outcome of preterm infants <30 weeks' gestation in a population of 100 infants, we used several neonatal and neurobehavioral tests, including cranial ultrasonography, the Prechtl neurological test, quality of spontaneous general movements, and quality of sleep-wake organization. RESULTS: The Prechtl test at corrected term age and findings on cranial sonograms both had high specificity, but the Prechtl test had better overall positive predictive power for normal neurological and developmental outcomes at 2 years' corrected age. Developmental changes in sleep and the amount of indeterminate sleep did not correlate with outcome. Scoring general movement quality did not predict outcome and did not augment the positive predictive power of the Prechtl test. CONCLUSIONS: The Prechtl test at corrected term age (independent of the other tests) is the best positive predictor of normal neurological outcome and Bayley test results at 2 years' corrected age.","2000-07","2019-02-14 12:32:09","2019-02-14 12:32:09","","100-106","","1","137","","Journal of Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Infant; Human; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Male; Child, Preschool; Infant Behavior; Data Analysis, Statistical; Neuropsychological Tests; Head -- Ultrasonography; Nervous System Diseases -- Diagnosis -- In Infancy and Childhood; Outcomes of Prematurity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little research has been conducted to identify the factors associated with psychosocial stress in pregnant women. Purpose: This study explored the predictors of psychosocial stress during pregnancy. Methods: A convenience sample of 136 second-trimester and 164 third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from a medical center in southern Taiwan. Data were collected using a demographic form, Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Maternal--Fetal Attachment Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List. Results: The results of this study found positive correlations between PSRS and both Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale (r = .368, p < .01) and MaternalYFetal Attachment Scale (r = .168, p < .01) and negative correlations between PSRS and both gravidity (r = -.137, p < .05) and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (r = -.266, p < .01). Higher pregnancy stress was predicted by depression, lower social support, maternal--fetal attachment, and primigravid status, which together explained 20% of the total variance. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Depression, social support, maternalYfetal attachment, and gravidity are discrete predictive factors of psychosocial stress in pregnant women. These findings add to existing knowledge of the factors associated with prenatal stress. Future research should include depression in a support model of antenatal stress management.","2016-09","2019-02-14 12:32:10","2019-02-14 12:32:10","","193-200","","3","24","","Journal of Nursing Research (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Adult; Human; Depression; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Psychological Tests; Scales; Summated Rating Scaling; T-Tests; Taiwan; Primiparas; Infant Care; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Stress, Psychological -- In Pregnancy; Maternal Role; One-Way Analysis of Variance; Support, Psychosocial; Prenatal Bonding; Exploratory Research; Step-Wise Multiple Regression; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors -- Taiwan; Family Relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A convenience sample of 80 African American HIV-positive women was recruited from university-based obstetrics/-gynecology and infectious disease practices in a large metropolitan city in the Mid-South. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Edinburgh Postnatal depression Scale (EPDS). Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). An investigator-developed demographic data form was used to obtain patient characteristics including data about inherited and acquired vulnerabilities. Inherited vulnerabilities included family history of mood disorders and family history of alcohol and/or drug use. Acquired vulnerabilities included educational level, income level, alcohol and/or use, HIV disclosure status, sleep quality, and history of sexual assault. The stress diathesis theory provided the conceptual basis for the study. The sample consisted of both pregnant (n = 20) and non-pregnant (n = 60) women. Participants were typically single (57.5%), middle-aged (33.21 +/- 10.7 years), and had completed high school (30%) or some college (35%). Poverty was prevalent in the sample, with 70.5% reporting annual household incomes below $10,000. Most women (92.5%) had disclosed their HIV status. Almost half of the sample (42%) reported a history of sexual assault. Substance abuse was higher in the non-pregnant group of women (40%) than the non-pregnant group (5%) of women. Median depressive symptom scores for the total sample were mildly elevated. Median anxiety symptom scores for the total sample illustrated little or no anxiety symptoms. Poor sleep quality was prevalent in both groups and was associated with elevated CES-D, EPDS, and BAI scores in both groups of women. Family history of mood disorders was associated with elevated CES-D scores in the group of pregnant women, and elevated BAI scores in both groups. HIV disclosure was associated with elevated CES-D scores in the pregnant group, and substance use with elevated CES-D scores, in the non-pregnant group. Non-pregnant HIV-positive women had higher depressive symptom scores on both the CES-D and EPDS when compared to pregnant HIV-positive women. Regression analyses were performed to determine which independent variables predicted elevated depressive and anxiety symptom scores. Substance use and poor sleep quality were statistically significant predictors, ac counting for 55% of the variance in CES-D scores, 43% of the variance in EPDS scores, and 53% of the variance in BAI scores. Future studies should include testing interventions that improve sleep quality. Untreated mood disorders are problematic in HIV-positive patients, as depression is associated with decreased adherence to highly active antiretroviral medications. Ongoing assessments of depressive and anxiety symptoms are necessary, as clinically significant levels resulting in referrals were warranted.","2008-01","2019-02-14 12:32:11","2019-02-14 12:32:11","","","167 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Tennessee Health Science Center","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3297904","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Depression; Convenience Sample; Descriptive Statistics; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Correlational Studies; Anxiety; Urban Areas; Regression; Blacks; Depression -- Risk Factors; Women; Models, Theoretical; Anxiety -- Risk Factors; Appalachian Region; HIV Seropositivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Factors that contribute to fatigue in a patient population include poor health status, psychological stress, poor nutrition, and pregnancy. Less well understood are factors that contribute to fatigue among healthy, nonpregnant individuals. Within the framework of the theory of unpleasant symptoms, 40 healthy young smoking and nonsmoking adults between the ages of 18 and 35 were evaluated to determine self-report level of fatigue and contributing physiological, psychological, and situational factors. Results indicate that while self-report of fatigue did not vary in this population based on gender, subjects who were moderate to heavy cigarette smokers were significantly more fatigued than were nonsmokers (F = 10.24, df = 1, 38, P < 0.01), with the effect being specific to male smokers. Self-report of fatigue did not correlate with body mass index, baseline inflammatory or immune status, or blood pressure. Positive psychological and situational predictors of fatigue included depression (r = 0.556, P < 0.001), state anxiety (r = 0.569, P < 0.001), sleep quality (r = -0.399, P < 0.05), and sleep quantity (r = -0.411, P < 0.05). These results suggest that psychological and situational factors are key contributors to fatigue in young adults and that smoking is a risk factor for fatigue in men.","2002-04","2019-02-14 12:32:13","2019-02-14 12:32:13","","222-233","","4","3","","Biological Research for Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Body Mass Index; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Depression; Male; Descriptive Statistics; Psychological Tests; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Fatigue; Anxiety; Health Status; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Blood Pressure; Purposive Sample; Sex Factors; Smoking; Pennsylvania; Conceptual Framework; Two-Way Analysis of Variance; Research Subject Recruitment; Theory; Step-Wise Multiple Regression; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; C-Reactive Protein; Carbon Monoxide -- Analysis; Cytokines; Predictive Research; Saliva -- Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The questionnaires included questions regarding the timing of sleep and sleep duration, work schedules (eg, shift work, night work), sleep positions, and previously diagnosed sleep disorders. Frequent snoring was defined as self-reported snoring ≥3 days per week. Participants underwent in-home portable sleep studies for sleep-disordered breathing assessment in early (6-15 weeks gestation) and mid pregnancy (22-31 weeks gestation). Sleep-disordered breathing was characterized by an apnea hypopnea index that included all apneas, plus hypopneas with ≥3% oxygen desaturation. For primary analyses, an apnea hypopnea index ≥5 events per hour was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for predictor variables. Predictive ability of the logistic models was estimated with area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves, along with sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios.Results: Among 3705 women who were enrolled, data were available for 3264 and 2512 women in early and mid pregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%, respectively. At each time point in gestation, frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, greater maternal age, body mass index, neck circumference, and systolic blood pressure were associated most strongly with an increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Logistic regression models that included current age, body mass index, and frequent snoring predicted sleep-disordered breathing in early pregnancy, sleep-disordered breathing in mid pregnancy, and new onset sleep-disordered breathing in mid pregnancy with 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves of 0.870, 0.838, and 0.809. We provide a supplement with expanded tables, integrated predictiveness, classification curves, and an predicted probability calculator.Conclusion: Among nulliparous pregnant women, logistic regression models with just 3 variables (ie, age, body mass index, and frequent snoring) achieved good prediction of prevalent and incident sleep-disordered breathing.

Women ( N = 215) were interviewed during pregnancy, 1- and 6-month postpartum. Mixed linear models were used to examine the longitudinal course and inter-relationships for the time-varying variables of antidepressant use, subjective sleep quality, and depression severity. Pregnant women with a depressive disorder who did not use antidepressants had more variable depression severity over time with improvements in depression severity by 6-month postpartum. In contrast, the depression severity of their medicated counterparts remained stable and high throughout. Pregnant women without a depressive disorder had worse sleep quality when using antidepressants compared with when they were not. Antidepressant use significantly strengthened the magnitude of the effect of sleep quality on depression severity in women with a depressive disorder during pregnancy. When prenatally depressed women use antidepressants, their sleep disturbance is more highly linked to depression severity than when they do not. Furthermore, antidepressants are not adequately treating the sleep disturbance of these women or their remitted counterparts, leaving both groups vulnerable to significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.","2017-10","2019-02-14 12:32:16","2019-02-14 12:32:16","","621-632","","5","20","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Depression -- Drug Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Pregnancy; Human; Sleep Disorders; Severity of Illness; Depression, Postpartum -- Drug Therapy; Antidepressive Agents -- Administration and Dosage -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ongoing nuMoM2b-HHS, which started in 2013, is a prospective follow-up of the nuMoM2b cohort, which included 10,038 women recruited between 2010 and 2013 from 8 centers across the United States who were initially observed over the course of their first pregnancies. In this report, we detail the design and study procedures of the nuMoM2b-HHS. Women in the pregnancy cohort who consented to be contacted for participation in future studies were approached at 6-month intervals to ascertain health information and to maintain ongoing contact. Two to 5 years after completion of the pregnancy documented in the nuMoM2b, women in the nuMoM2b-HHS were invited to an in-person study visit. During this visit, they completed psychosocial and medical history questionnaires and had clinical measurements and biological specimens obtained. A subcohort of participants who had objective assessments of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy were asked to repeat this investigation. This unique prospective observational study includes a large, geographically and ethnically diverse cohort, rich depth of phenotypic information about adverse pregnancy outcomes, and clinical data and biospecimens from early in the index pregnancy onward. Data obtained from this cohort will provide mechanistic and clinical insights into how data on a first pregnancy can provide information about the potential development of subsequent risk factors for cardiovascular disease.","2016-03-15","2019-02-14 12:32:17","2019-02-14 12:32:17","","519-530","","6","183","","American Journal of Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Funding Source; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Scales; Women's Health; Study Design; Observational Methods; Cardiovascular System Physiology; Cardiovascular Risk Factors; Cardiovascular Diseases; Nulliparas -- Psychosocial Factors; Sleep Apnea, Central","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brain death is the unequivocal and irreversible loss of total brain function, whereas patients in a vegetative state, by contrast, have preserved brain stem function but lack cerebral function. They can appear to be awake, have sleep-wake cycles, be capable of swallowing, and have normal respiratory control, but there are no purposeful interactions. These conditions have different maternal prognoses, but both have resulted in near-normal neonatal outcomes with long latencies from maternal injury to delivery in previously published cases. This article compares and contrasts the 11 cases of brain death with 15 cases of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy. We found that the mean latency between maternal brain injury and delivery was significantly shorter in the brain-dead patients as compared with those in a vegetative state (46 days vs. 124 days, P </=.001). Correspondingly, the gestational ages at delivery (29.7 weeks vs. 33.2 weeks, P </=.01) and the birth weights (1380 g vs. 2145 g, P </=.01) were shorter in duration and smaller in size in the brain-dead group. We also present a case of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy at our institution with both maternal and neonatal death in the context of previously published literature with a focus on obstetric and ethical management. We hope this information will help elucidate the issues for providers confronted with these unique and challenging cases. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to state the difference between coma, persistent vegetative state and brain death, to describe the neurologic aspects of a patient in a persistent vegetative state, and to list the fetal effects of maternal brain injury.","2003-11","2019-02-14 12:32:18","2019-02-14 12:32:18","","738-789","","11","58","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Education, Continuing (Credit); Brain Death -- In Pregnancy; Persistent Vegetative State -- In Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications -- Ethical Issues","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study characterized the somatosensory profile of pregnant and nonpregnant women and the relationship between pain, hypersensitivity, and commonly used manual clinical tests. Thirty-nine pregnant and 22 nonpregnant women were included. Although lumbopelvic pain was not an inclusion criterion, the pregnant women were divided into low- and high-pain groups following data collection. The sensitivity to light brush, pin-prick, and pressure pain was assessed bilaterally at 3 sites in the lumbopelvic region, at the shoulder, and in the lower leg. Responses to the active straight leg raise test and pain provocation tests of the sacroiliac joint were recorded. Participants completed questionnaires addressing emotional and physical well-being and rated disability using the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire. Compared with controls, the high-pain group rated the active straight leg raise test as more difficult (P < .05), and both pain groups had more positive pain provocation tests (P < .05). The pregnant groups demonstrated significantly lower pressure pain thresholds at most assessment sites compared with controls (P < .05), but self-reported disability and pain were not correlated with pressure pain thresholds within pregnant participants. The high-pain group reported worse emotional health and poorer sleep quality than controls (P < .05). PERSPECTIVE: This article presents the somatosensory profile of a healthy pregnant cohort. The results indicate that pain sensitivity increases during pregnancy possibly owing to the physical changes the body undergoes during pregnancy but also owing to changes in emotional health. This should be accounted for in clinical management of pregnant women with lumbopelvic pain.","2015-03","2019-02-14 12:32:19","2019-02-14 12:32:19","","270-282","","3","16","","Journal of Pain","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy rhinitis is a condition of clinical importance that is frequently exacerbated by use of intranasal decongestant sprays. The resulting rhinitis medicamentosa exacerbates the nasal obstruction, with resulting sleep disruptions that negatively impact the experience of pregnancy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurse practitioners may miss opportunities to provide support, anticipatory guidance, and symptom relief. Anticipatory guidance that stresses the critical necessity of avoiding nasal spray decongestants, environmental modification, use of intranasal saline, moderate exercise, and nasal strips for subjective relief may have the potential to markedly decrease escalation of the condition to a serious disorder.","2002-12","2019-02-14 12:32:19","2019-02-14 12:32:19","","527-530","","12","14","","Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Pregnancy Complications; Primiparas; Rhinitis -- Diagnosis; Rhinitis -- Drug Therapy; Rhinitis -- Etiology; Rhinitis -- In Pregnancy; Rhinitis -- Therapy; Vasoconstrictor Agents, Nasal -- Adverse Effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Using laboratory-based polysomnography, we evaluated for the frequency of SDB in women with gestational hypertension compared to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. METHODS: In this single-center cross-sectional study, women with the diagnosis of gestational hypertension were screened in the Fetal Assessment Unit and Antepartum ward. Healthy subjects were recruited by local advertising. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, followed by full night polysomnography. The primary outcome was frequency of SDB (defined as a respiratory disturbance index >= 5) in the gestational hypertension and healthy groups. RESULTS: A total of 34 women with gestational hypertension and singleton pregnancies and 26 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies consented to participate in the study. The mean ages and gestational ages, but not the body mass indices, of the 2 groups were similar. The frequencies of SDB in the more obese gestational hypertension group and the healthy group were 53% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Women with gestational hypertension may have a significantly higher frequency of SDB than do healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of similar gestational age. The relative causal contributions, if any, of SDB and obesity remain to be determined. CITATION: Reid J; Skomro R; Cotton D; Ward H; Olatunbosun F; Gjevre J; Guilleminault C.

There was a trend for preterm labor to be associated with lower perceived fatigue severity, low sleep disturbance, and more negative life events.

Head circumference (HC) and lateral ventricles size were assessed with mid- and late-pregnancy fetal ultrasounds, and with cranial ultrasound 3-20 weeks postnatally. Mothers reported children's sleep duration at 2 and 3 years, and sleep problems at 1.5, 3, and 6 years.ResultsLarger ventricular size, but not HC, was related to longer sleep duration at 3 years (β=0.06 h, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02; 0.10 in late-pregnancy and β=0.11 h, 95% CI: 0.02; 0.20 in early infancy, mid-pregnancy parameters were unrelated to sleep duration).

We investigated (1) the association of SDB with a wide range of risk factors, including prenatal and perinatal complications; (2) the association of these complications with SES and race; and (3) the association of SDB with developmental milestones. METHODS: Six hundred thirteen school-aged children (105 clinically referred and 508 community control subjects) underwent overnight polysomnography and had a complete history and physical examination. A comprehensive child development questionnaire was completed by a parent. We compared clinically referred children with SDB to population-based control children without SDB from The Penn State Children's Cohort. RESULTS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy; maternal age and weight gain during pregnancy; prenatal complications, such as maternal high blood pressure and gestational diabetes; perinatal complications related to prematurity; delayed motor milestones; race and SES were significantly associated with the presence of childhood SDB. Most of the risk factors became nonsignificant when analyses controlled for race and SES. Delayed motor milestones remained significantly associated with SDB after controlling for race and SES. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that there is a significant association between children who experience prenatal or perinatal distress and the development of moderate to severe childhood SDB. SES and race may be mediating the impact on SDB through increased prenatal and perinatal risks. The significant delay in motor milestones suggests that prenatal and perinatal distress may result in neurologic insult, which could influence the development of SDB in later childhood.","2010-06-15","2019-02-14 12:32:27","2019-02-14 12:32:27","","264-269","","3","6","","Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Child; Questionnaires; Human; Infant, Newborn; Male; Risk Factors; Population; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Socioeconomic Factors; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Epidemiology; Mothers; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Smoking -- Epidemiology; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Causal Attribution; Childbirth, Premature -- Epidemiology; Pennsylvania; Polysomnography -- Methods; Intensive Care, Neonatal -- Methods; Infant, Premature, Diseases -- Epidemiology; Infant, Premature, Diseases -- Therapy; Intensive Care, Neonatal -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Oxygen Therapy -- Methods; Oxygen Therapy -- Statistics and Numerical Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that maternal snus (smokeless tobacco) use during pregnancy affects autonomic cardiac regulation in the infant, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and the low frequency and high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio).Methods: A prospective observational study of 56 infants of women who used snus (n = 23) or cigarettes (n = 13) during pregnancy versus tobacco- and nicotine-free controls (n = 19). The nicotine dose was estimated by questionnaires at 4 timepoints pre- and post-natally. The infants' urine cotinine concentration and HRV during 2 hours of sleep were studied 1-2 months after birth.Results: LF/HF ratio was higher in snus (mean 3.31; 95% CI 2.78-3.83) and smoke (3.51;2.54-4.47) compared to controls (2.15; 1.76-2.54, p = .002). Early prenatal nicotine exposure ""without"" any further exposure increased the LF/HF ratio (3.19; 2.55-3.84, p = .02). Continuous prenatal nicotine exposure ""without"" postnatal exposure was also associated with a residual increase in LF/HF ratio (4.40; 3.38-5.42, p < .001). There was no difference between infants exposed to smokeless versus smoked tobacco, suggesting a common constituent (nicotine) altering autonomic cardiac regulation.Conclusion: Infants to mothers who used snus during pregnancy showed lower vagal activity with an increased LF/HF ratio compared to controls, and similar to infants of smokers. Even early prenatal exposure to snus has a lasting impact on autonomic cardiac regulation suggesting a fetal ""re-programing"" of the developing autonomic nervous system.Implications: The results indicate that smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) affects the developing autonomic nervous system during gestation. Even if exposure is interrupted during the first or second trimester, effects in autonomic cardiac regulation are seen in the 1-2 month-old infant. This underlines the importance of abstaining from all types of tobacco use during the whole pregnancy. Our findings may also have more general relevance to other routes by which nicotine can be delivered to a fetus and newborn.","2017-07","2019-02-14 12:32:30","2019-02-14 12:32:30","","797-803","","7","19","","Nicotine & Tobacco Research","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Infant; Adult; Human; Infant, Newborn; Male; Sweden; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Electrocardiography; Arrhythmia -- Etiology; Arrhythmia -- Physiopathology; Autonomic Nervous System -- Drug Effects; Tobacco, Smokeless -- Adverse Effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: We studied the risk of low birth weight (LBW) and reduced mean birth weight in relation to reported use of wood for cooking during the prenatal period, compared with natural gas (NG). METHODS: We studied a historical cohort of women who had a singleton live birth in the years 2000-2002, from a semirural area of Pakistan. Infant's birth weight was obtained from records, and prenatal records had data for maternal body mass index and parity. Cooking habits, daytime sleep habits, and type of fuel used during the pregnancies in 2000-2002 were ascertained by a survey done in 2004-2005. We performed multiple linear and logistic regression modeling using propensity scores to adjust for confounding variables. RESULTS: Unadjusted mean (± SD) birth weight was 2.78 ± 0.45 kg in wood users, and 2.84 ± 0.43 kg (p < 0.06) in NG users. Infants born to wood users averaged 82 g lighter than infants born to NG users when weight was adjusted for confounders (p < 0.07). The rate of LBW (< 2,500 g) was 22.7% among wood users compared with 15.0% in NG users (p < 0.01), for an adjusted relative risk of 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.34). The population attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use was estimated to be 24%. CONCLUSION: Cooking with wood fuel during pregnancy, a potentially modifiable exposure, was associated with LBW and marginally lower mean birth weight compared with using NG.","2008-04","2019-02-14 12:32:32","2019-02-14 12:32:32","","543-549","","4","116","","Environmental Health Perspectives","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Logistic Regression; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; T-Tests; Relative Risk; Confidence Intervals; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Linear Regression; Air Pollution, Indoor; Cooking; Environmental Exposure -- In Pregnancy; Pakistan; Smoke","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prenatal NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL) (NAP+SAL) prevent developmental delay in Ts65Dn mice, a mouse model of DS. We investigated whether this finding involves N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant Ts65Dn mice were treated with placebo or NAP+SAL on gestational days 8-12. After developmental delay prevention was shown, 4 trisomic (Ts), 4 control, and 3 Ts+NAP+SAL adult offspring brains (from 3 litters) were collected. Calibrator-normalized real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subunits NR2A and NR2B, and for GABA subunits GABA(A)alpha5 and GABA(A)beta3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistics included analysis of variance and Fisher PLSD with P < .05 as significant. RESULTS: NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3 levels were decreased in Ts vs control (all P < .05). Prenatal NAP+SAL increased NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3 to levels similar to control (all P < .05). A significant difference in GABA(A)alpha5 levels was not found. CONCLUSION: Prenatal NAP+SAL increases NR2A, NR2B, and GABA(A)beta3 expression in adult DS mice to levels similar to controls. This may explain how NAP+SAL improve developmental milestone achievement.","2009-05","2019-02-14 12:32:33","2019-02-14 12:32:33","","524.e1-4","","5","200","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Animal Studies; Models, Biological; Down Syndrome; Animal Population Groups; Mice; Oligopeptides -- Pharmacodynamics; Brain Diseases; Brain Diseases -- Drug Therapy; Brain Diseases -- Prevention and Control; Central Nervous System; Central Nervous System -- Drug Effects; Central Nervous System -- Embryology; Down Syndrome -- Complications; Intellectual Disability -- Drug Therapy; Intellectual Disability -- Prevention and Control; Nerve Tissue Proteins -- Pharmacodynamics; Peptides -- Pharmacodynamics; Receptors, Cell Surface; Receptors, Cell Surface -- Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fetal brain undergoes massive growth, organization, and connectivity during gestation, making it particularly vulnerable to neurotoxic insult. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are extensively involved in growth, connectivity, and function of developing neural circuitry and neurotransmitter systems. Thus, PNE may have long-term impact on neurobehavioral development. The purpose of this study was to compare the auditory K-complex, an event-related potential reflective of auditory gating, sleep preservation and memory consolidation during sleep, in infants with and without PNE and to relate these neural correlates to neurobehavioral development.Methods: We compared brain responses to an auditory paired-click paradigm in 3- to 5-month-old infants during Stage 2 sleep, when the K-complex is best observed. We measured component amplitude and delta activity during the K-complex.Results: Infants with PNE demonstrated significantly smaller amplitude of the N550 component and reduced delta-band power within elicited K-complexes compared to nonexposed infants and also were less likely to orient with a head turn to a novel auditory stimulus (bell ring) when awake.Conclusions: PNE may impair auditory sensory gating, which may contribute to disrupted sleep and to reduced auditory discrimination and learning, attention re-orienting, and/or arousal during wakefulness reported in other studies.Implications: Links between PNE and reduced K-complex amplitude and delta power may represent altered cholinergic and GABAergic synaptic programming and possibly reflect early neural bases for PNE-linked disruptions in sleep quality and auditory processing. These may pose significant disadvantage for language acquisition, attention, and social interaction necessary for academic and social success.","2018-07","2019-02-14 12:32:34","2019-02-14 12:32:34","","897-902","","7","20","","Nicotine & Tobacco Research","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: An epidemiologic cohort study of 289 eight-year-old children born at term. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep duration and efficiency were measured by actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights (mean = 7.1, SD = 1.2). We used both continuous measures of poor sleep and binary variables of short sleep and low sleep efficiency ( < or = 10th percentiles). Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Lower birth weight and shorter length at birth were associated with lower sleep efficiency. For every 1-SD decrease in weight and length at birth, the odds for low sleep efficiency increased by 1.7 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 2.7) and 2.2 fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 3.7), respectively. For every 1-SD decrease in ponderal index at birth, the risk of parent-reported sleep disorders increased by 1.4 fold (95% CI: 1.0 to 2.0). Moreover, children exposed prenatally to alcohol had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.1 to 7.6) and 3.6-fold (95% CI: 1.3 to 10.0) increased risk for having short sleep and low sleep efficiency, respectively. The associations were not confounded by sex, gestational length, prenatal and perinatal complications, body mass index at 8 years, asthma, allergies, or parental socioeconomic status.

However, no prior studies have assessed if pregnant women with RLS have an elevated risk of depression during and/or after pregnancy. METHODS: 1,428 women who were pregnant in gestational week 16-17 were asked to participate in a longitudinal survey. They were followed by web-based questionnaires in gestational week 17 and 32, and 6 weeks after delivery. Data were also retrieved from prenatal and birth records. Two different sets of criteria were used to examine the prevalence of RLS in the cohort (International Restless Legs Syndrome Society Group standard criteria and the later developed CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire). The latter questionnaire attempts to exclude those with common 'mimics' of RLS. RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratio for depression in gestational week 17, 32, and postpartum week 6 in relation to pre-pregnancy RLS onset and moderate to severe symptom severity were 4.74 (2.30 - 9.76), 3.67 (1.85 - 7.28), and 2.58 (1.28 - 5.21), respectively. No significant associations were seen in pregnant women with de novo RLS during pregnancy. When using the standard diagnostic RLS criteria and frequency of symptoms more than 2-3 days per week, the prevalence of RLS was 12.3%. With the CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire and the same threshold for frequency of symptoms the prevalence was 6.5%. CONCLUSION: Women with RLS onset before pregnancy with moderate or severe symptoms had an increased risk of both antenatal and postnatal depression. The self-reported prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is lower when a questionnaire dealing with 'mimics' is used. CITATION: Wesström J, Skalkidou A, Manconi M, Fulda S, Sundström-Poromaa I.

Full-term infants at birth can recognize their mothers' voices. It is believed that this early ability of newborn infants is acquired from prenatal experience with the mother's voice. The mother's voice is the most salient sound in the uterus, and the fetus can hear sound beginning of 24 weeks gestation. However, preterm infants are born with insufficient prenatal vocal experience and an immature auditory system which is more sensitive to low frequency sounds than high frequency sounds. Preterm infants have minimal exposure to the human voice in the NICU but are exposed to loud mechanical noises. Preteen infant may hear the male voice better than the female voice to produce attentive behaviors.The purpose of this study was to examine preterm infants' responsiveness to female and male voice over time. Nineteen preterm infants (< 32 weeks gestation) were enrolled in the study. The sleep/awake state, motor (stress and self-regulatory) behavior, and autonomic (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) responses were recorded by a Gould Recording System and two digital video cameras. The data was collected once a week from 32 weeks post-conceptional age through hospital discharge. Changes from baseline in each infant's responses during the vocal stimulation and during the post-vocal stimulation were analyzed using a chi square test and MANOVA.Results indicated that the drowsy state increased during vocal stimulation and after vocal stimulation the asleep state increased. The heart rate of the preterm infant increased slightly during vocal stimulation but decreased after vocal stimulation. Overall, the vocal stimulation did not evoke either stress or self-regulatory responses during presentation. The difference in the preterm infant responses to the male and the female voices was not statistically significant.Vocal stimulation has some benefit for the preterm infant as evidenced by increased sleep state, no stress responses, and the cardiac orienting response. These data provide an insight into the early auditory responses of the preterm intent to human voice, with implications for both parent(s) and health care providers to enhance early interaction between the parents and the infants in the NICU.","2007-01","2019-02-14 12:34:01","2019-02-14 12:34:01","","","158 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Chicago, Health Sciences Center","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3294639","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Human; Male; Sleep -- Physiology; Infant, Premature -- Evaluation; Intensive Care Units; Voice Quality -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diagnosis of RLS was established by the 4 criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). The severity of RLS was assessed through the IRLSSG Rating Scale.Results: Seventy-nine (17.8%) women met the RLS diagnostic criteria, with most (74.7%) having RLS of moderate severity. The mean RLS duration before delivery was 3.1 ± 2.1 months among 69 (87.3%) women; 10 (12.7%) had RLS onset before pregnancy. Sleep disturbances including insomnia and early awakening were significantly more common among women with RLS than among those without (P < 0.001), and the frequency of cesarean delivery was also significantly higher (58.2% versus 44.5%, P = 0.027; odds ratio 2.4). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, number of pregnancies, folate and iron supplementation, hemoglobin level, and neonatal anthropometric data.Conclusion: Restless legs syndrome is common during pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep and an increased risk of cesarean delivery.","2013-10","2019-02-14 12:34:02","2019-02-14 12:34:02","","46-49","","1","123","","International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Sleep Disorders -- Etiology; Middle Age; Restless Legs -- Epidemiology; Prevalence; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Sleep Disorders -- Epidemiology; Iran; Severity of Illness Indices; Cesarean Section -- Statistics and Numerical Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Analysis was guided by the socioecological model levels of: Infant, Maternal, Family, and Community/Society within the context of race. Data from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed to address the first objective and from 2000 to 2004 and 2006 to 2011 to address the second objective. Rao-Scott Chi square tests and backward selection unconditional logistic regression models for weighted data were built separately by race; odds ratios (OR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results A total of 6595 (3528 Black and 3067 White) cases were analyzed between 2004 and 2011. Significantly more Black mothers (81.9 %) reported 'ever' bed-sharing compared to White mothers (56 %), p < 0.001. Logistic regression results indicated that the most parsimonious model included variables from all socioecological levels. For Blacks, the final model included infant age, pregnancy intention, number of dependents, and use of Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Services. For Whites, the final model included infant age, maternal age, financial stress, partner-related stress, and WIC. When comparing the period 2000-2004 to 2006-2011, a total of 10,015 (5373 Black and 4642 White cases) were analyzed. A significant decrease in bedsharing was found for both Blacks and Whites; rates of non-supine sleep position decreased significantly for Blacks but not Whites. Conclusions for Practice Continued high rates of bed-sharing and non-supine sleep position for both Blacks and Whites demonstrate an ongoing need for safe infant sleep messaging. Risk profiles for Black and White mothers differed, suggesting the importance of tailored messaging.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP), leg pain (LP), and pelvic girdle pain (PGP) in pregnant Spanish women and to identify the factors associated with a higher risk. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies on the prevalence and risk factors for LBP and PGP have shown inconsistent results. METHODS: Sixty-one clinicians across 5 regions in Spain recruited 1158 women with a median (interquartile range) pregnancy of 35 (range, 31-38) weeks. Validated methods were used to gather data on the prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP, anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics, history of LBP, obstetrical history, physical activity before and during pregnancy, mattress and sleep characteristics, disability, anxiety, and depression. Separate multiple logistic regression models were developed to identify the variables associated with LBP, LP, and PGP. RESULTS: The 4-week prevalence of LBP, LP, and PGP was 71.3%, 46.2%, and 64.7%, respectively. Main factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting pain for LBP were history of LBP related and unrelated to previous pregnancy and postpartum, pain augmenting with time spent in bed, and anxiety. Previous lumbar surgery was associated with a lower risk. The factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting LP were reporting LBP, lower academic level, younger age, depression, a lower number of hours of sleep per day, and a higher BMI, and for PGP were higher score for depression, a higher body mass index, and a more advanced stage of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with a higher risk vary between LBP and PGP. History of LBP, related or not to previous pregnancy or postpartum, LBP surgery, and anxiety were the factors more strongly associated with pregnancy-related LBP. When these variables are taken into account, obstetrical data from current or previous pregnancies and other variables do not show a significant association with LBP. Stage of pregnancy and depression were associated with PGP.","2012","2019-02-14 12:34:04","2019-02-14 12:34:04","","1516-1533","","17","37","","Spine (03622436)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Adult; Human; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Postnatal Period; Pain -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Etiology; Risk Assessment; Depression -- Complications; Spain; Anxiety -- Complications; Low Back Pain -- Etiology; Leg -- Physiopathology; Low Back Pain -- Epidemiology; Pain -- Etiology; Pelvic Pain -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim was to explore the prevalence and incidence of domestic violence among pregnant women, in the southwestern region of Scania in Sweden, and their experience of a history of violence. In addition, to explore the association between domestic violence during pregnancy and possible risk factors.Methods: This is a longitudinal cohort-study including pregnant women ≥18 years of age, registered at antenatal care when pregnant. A cohort of 1939 pregnant women answered Questionnaire I (QI) in gestational week 13 (mean 12.8 week, SD 5.11). Response rate of Questionnaire II (QII) in gestation week 34 (mean 33.9 week, SD 2.2) was 78.8 % (n = 1527). Statistical analysis was descriptive statistics, logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).Results: Both QI and QII were completed by 77.8 % (n = 1509) of the women and 44.3 % (n = 668) reported a lifetime experience of abuse irrespective of type, severity or perpetrator. Also, 5.1 % (n = 77) reported some experience of abuse past year. Prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy was 2.0 % (n = 29) and the incidence was 7.3 new cases per 1000 women. The strongest risk factor for domestic violence, during early and late pregnancy, was history of violence whereby all women who disclosed exposure had also reported history of violence (p < 0.001). To be single/living apart gave 8.4 times more risk associated with domestic violence during pregnancy (AOR 8.4; 95 % CI: 2.2-32.6). Having several symptoms of depression and lack of sleep gave 3.8 times more risk respectively (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI: 1.1-13.6) and (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI 1.1-12.9).Conclusions: Pregnant women with a history of violence as well as being single/living apart and/or having several symptoms of depression during pregnancy should be alerts for clinical working midwives and obstetricians. Further, this is important knowledge for health care providers to develop or upgrade guidelines and plans of action for pregnant women exposed to violence.","2016-08-17","2019-02-14 12:34:05","2019-02-14 12:34:05","","1-10","","","16","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Adult; Human; Sweden; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Trimester, Third -- Psychosocial Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Incidence; Depression -- Epidemiology; Domestic Violence; Pregnancy Trimester, First -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was performed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of OSA in a semi-urban Indian population. DESIGN: A two-stage, cross-sectional, community-based prevalence study. SETTING: A semi-urban community in Delhi.Duration: Two years (2003 to 2005).Patients and participants: All citizens residing in the community who were 30 to 60 years of age. Exclusion criteria included those patients with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV congestive heart failure, pregnancy, hypothyroidism on treatment, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, systemic steroid treatment, and hormone replacement therapy. INTERVENTION: An OSA assessment was performed in 2,400 subjects who were screened in stage 1 of the study by means of a sleep questionnaire. Subjects were then divided into habitual and nonhabitual snorers. Eighty-three randomly selected habitual snorers and 80 nonhabitual snorers were invited to participate in stage 2 of the study, which consisted of in-hospital polysomnography studies.Observations and results: A total of 2,150 subjects returned questionnaires (response rate, 90%). Of 550 habitual snorers and 1,596 nonhabitual snorers, 77 habitual snorers and 73 nonhabitual snorers underwent polysomnography. A total of 36 habitual snorers (46.75%) and 2 nonhabitual snorers (2.73%) were found to have OSA, giving prevalence rates of 13.74% and 3.57%, respectively, for OSA and OSA syndrome (OSAS) on extrapolation. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, age, obesity (defined by a high body mass index), and waist/hip ratio as significant risk factors for OSAS. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the risk factors and prevalence for OSA in India are similar to those in the West, which is contrary to the findings of some previous reports, which had a strong inclusion bias.","2006-07","2019-02-14 12:34:06","2019-02-14 12:34:06","","149-156","","1","130","","CHEST","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Polysomnography; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Diagnosis; Male; Middle Age; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Epidemiology; India; Obesity -- Complications; Smoking; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Etiology; Snoring -- Complications; Alcohol Drinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study was to explore prevalence of domestic violence among pregnant women in southern Sweden (Scania) and to explore associations with background factors, as symptoms of depression and sense of coherence.Methods: This study has a cross-sectional design and is the first part of a longitudinal, cohort study. Inclusion criteria were women ≥ 18 years, registered at antenatal care when pregnant and who understand and write Swedish or English. Questionnaires were collected prospectively at seventeen antenatal care receptions situated in the two cities and six smaller municipalities in Scania. Statistical analyses were done using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, bivariate logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Study sample included 1939 women. History of violence was reported by 39.5% (n =761) women. Significant differences were obtained between the groups with or without history of violence regarding being single/living apart, unemployment, financial distress, smoking/snuffing, unintended pregnancy as well as history of miscarriage/legalised abortion (p < 0.001). Experience of domestic violence during pregnancy regardless of type or level of abuse was 1.0% (n = 18); history of physical abuse by actual intimate partner was 2.2% (n = 42). History of violence was the strongest risk factor associated with domestic violence during pregnancy, where all women (n = 18) exposed reported history of violence (p < 0.001). Several symptoms of depression (adjusted for low socio-economic status, miscarriage/abortion, single/living apart, lack of sleep, unemployment, age and parity) were associated with a 7.0 fold risk of domestic violence during pregnancy (OR 7.0; 95% CI: 1.9-26.3).Conclusions: The reported prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy in southwest Sweden is low. However, a considerable proportion of women reported history of living in a violent relationship. Both history of violence and the presence of several depressive symptoms detected in early pregnancy may indicate that the woman also is exposed to domestic violence during pregnancy. Increased attention to this vulnerable group of women is needed to improve maternal and child health.","2014-01","2019-02-14 12:34:07","2019-02-14 12:34:07","","63-63","","1","14","","BMC Women's Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Sweden; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Depression -- Epidemiology; Self Concept; Pregnancy, Unplanned; Domestic Violence; Abortion, Induced -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Abortion, Spontaneous -- Epidemiology; Domestic Violence -- Psychosocial Factors; Intimate Partner Violence; Intimate Partner Violence -- Psychosocial Factors; Sexual Abuse; Sexual Abuse -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information regarding maternal behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends, to enhance the understanding of the relations between behaviors and health outcomes, to plan and evaluate programs, to direct policy decisions, and to monitor progress toward Healthy People 2000 and 2010 objectives.Reporting Period Covered: This report covers data from 1993 through 1999.Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver a live-born infant. PRAMS employs a mixed-mode data collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with a telephone interview. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets. PRAMS generates statewide estimates of various perinatal health topics among women delivering a live infant. Data for 1999 from 17 states are examined. In addition, trend data are examined for 12 states that had at least 3 years of data during 1993--1999.Results: In 1999, the prevalence of unintended pregnancy resulting in a live birth ranged from 33.7% to 52% across the 17 states. During 1993--1999, only one state reported a decreasing trend in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy. Women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care ranged from 16.1% to 29.9%. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care significantly decreased over time in seven of the 12 states with trend data. In general, women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report late or no entry into prenatal care. The prevalence of smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 6.2% to 27.2%, and the prevalence decreased in five states from 1993 to 1999. Overall, smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy was associated with younger age (<25 years), non-Hispanic ethnicity, having less than or equal to a high . school education, receiving Medicaid, and delivering a low birthweight infant. The prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during pregnancy ranged from 2.1% to 6.3%. No trends were observed for physical abuse from 1996 to 1999, the only years for which these data were available. Across the 17 states, only Medicaid status was consistently associated with experiencing physical abuse during pregnancy. The prevalence of breast-feeding initiation ranged from 48% to 89%. Ten of 12 states with trend data reported increases in the prevalence of breast-feeding initiation. Overall, women aged <20 years, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were less likely to breast-feed. The prevalence of breast-feeding duration for at least 4 weeks ranged from 34.9% to 78.1%. From 1993 to 1999, increases in levels of breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks were observed in eight states. Women aged <25 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were generally less likely to breast-feed for at least 4 weeks. The prevalence of back sleep position for infants ranged from 35.1% to 74.6%. Increases in the use of the back sleep position were observed in all 12 states with trend data from 1996 to 1999. Black race and having less than or equal to a high school education were consistently associated with not using the back sleep position.Interpretation: For surveillance during 1993--1999, the majority or all states observed increases in breast-feeding initiation, breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks, and back sleep position. Approximately one half of the states observed decreases for late or no entry into prenatal care and smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Little or no progress was observed in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy or physical abuse during pregnancy.With few exceptions, the 17 states failed to meet the Healthy People 2000 objectives for the seven reported behaviors in 1999. Certain demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of women were associated with an increased risk for several of the behaviors, including younger age, black race, less education, and receipt of Medicaid just before or during pregnancy.Public Health Action: State maternal and child health programs can use these population-based data for reporting on core and state-negotiated performance measures of the Title V Block Grant Measurement Performance System. The data, which are important in planning and evaluation programs, help identify whether target populations are receiving services and help identify barriers to or gaps in services. The data can be shared with policy makers to direct policy decisions that might affect the health of mothers and infants. In addition, these findings can be used to monitor progress toward Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010 objectives.","2002-04-27","2019-02-14 12:34:08","2019-02-14 12:34:08","","1-27","","16","51","","MMWR: Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; United States; Infant, Newborn; Descriptive Statistics; Prevalence; Self Report; Confidence Intervals; Surveys; Prenatal Care; Statistical Significance; Breast Feeding; Blacks; Birth Weight; Maternal Behavior; Whites; Smoking; Posture; Hispanics; Epidemiological Research; Pregnancy, Unplanned; Domestic Violence; Medicaid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may be particularly salient for pregnant women since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation (10-20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms and stress. Methods: Pregnant women (N=160) with no self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks' gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results: Approximately 28%-38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient ( p<0.01). Depressive symptoms were higher among women with diary-defined sleep deficiency across all time points ( p=0.02). Discussion: Sleep deficiency is a useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.","2013-12","2019-02-14 12:34:09","2019-02-14 12:34:09","","1028-1037","","12","22","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Prevalence; Scales; Self Report; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Clinical Assessment Tools; Diaries; Pennsylvania; Sleep Disorders -- Epidemiology -- In Pregnancy; Depression -- Risk Factors -- In Pregnancy; Software; Stress, Psychological -- Risk Factors -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior. RESULTS: Data were obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% CI 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep duration and in women who drank. CONCLUSION: Smoking among pregnant women remains an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote antismoking measures based on the results of this study.

Its origin is multifactorial, involving genetic, socioeconomic and environmental factors. These last ones contribute mostly to explain the current epidemic growth of this disease. The sedentary lifestyle, inadequate diet, lack of sleep, alterations in intestinal microbiota and stress are factors related to its development. Since Barker presented his hypothesis about the ""fetal origin of adult diseases"", there are increasing number of studies that show the influence of an inadequate nutritional status and maternal weight in the development of chronic diseases, as obesity in offspring. The nutritional deficiencies of the pregnant mother cause epigenetic modifications and abnormal programming of the development oforgans and devices, adapting the fetus to this situation of deficiency and being able to adapt to an obesogenic environment after birth, increasing its propensity to obesity. Also, poor maternal nutritional status is related to intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight infants, with a higher risk of childhood and adult central obesity. Currently, deficient intake of micronutrients and overweight or maternal obesity tend to overlap, and this combination may exacerbate the increase in obesity in the offspring. It is important to identify pregnant mothers at risk of suffering nutritional alterations and establish their improvement as a primary prevention strategy for overweight and obesity.","2017-10-04","2019-02-14 12:34:12","2019-02-14 12:34:12","","53-57","","","34","","Nutricion Hospitalaria","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Obesity -- Prevention and Control; Pregnancy Complications -- Prevention and Control; Postnatal Care; Maternal Nutritional Physiology; Preventive Health Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cross-sectional studies suggest that infant diet, activity and sleep are linked to excessive weight gain. As intervention for overweight children is difficult, the aim of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study is to evaluate two primary prevention strategies during late pregnancy and early childhood that could be delivered separately or together as part of normal health care.Methods/design: This four-arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 800 families recruited at booking in the only maternity unit in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. Mothers are randomised during pregnancy to either a usual care group (7 core contacts with a provider of government funded ""Well Child"" care over 2 years) or to one of three intervention groups given education and support in addition to ""Well Child"" care: the Food, Activity and Breastfeeding group which receives 8 extra parent contacts over the first 2 years of life; the Sleep group which receives at least 3 extra parent contacts over the first 6 months of life with a focus on prevention of sleep problems and then active intervention if there is a sleep problem from 6 months to 2 years; or the Combination group which receives all extra contacts. The main outcome measures are conditional weight velocity (0-6, 6-12, 12-24 months) and body mass index z-score at 24 months, with secondary outcomes including sleep and physical activity (parent report, accelerometry), duration of breastfeeding, timing of introduction of solids, diet quality, and measures of family function and wellbeing (parental depression, child mindedness, discipline practices, family quality of life and health care use). This study will contribute to a prospective meta-analysis of early life obesity prevention studies in Australasia.Discussion: Infancy is likely to be the most effective time to establish patterns of behaviour around food, activity and sleep that promote healthy child and adult weight. The POI.nz study will determine the extent to which sleep, food and activity interventions in infancy prevent the development of overweight.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials NCT00892983.

STUDY DESIGN: Using a well-characterized fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) model, timed pregnant C57BL6/J mice were treated on gestational day (E) 8 with alcohol (0.03 mL/g), placebo, or alcohol plus (NAP plus SAL). Embryos were harvested at 6 hours (E8), 24 hours (E9), and 10 days (E18) and pups at postnatal day 40. Calibrator-normalized relative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify BDNF with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-1 standardization. RESULTS: BDNF expression was lower in the alcohol-exposed embryos than in controls at 6 hours and higher at 24 hours and 10 days (all P<.05). Pretreatment with NAP plus SAL prevented the alcohol-induced rise in BDNF expression (P<.05) at 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure. We found no difference between alcohol and control in young-adults' brain (P>.05). CONCLUSION: NAP plus SAL treatment prevented alcohol-induced changes in BDNF expression 24 hours and 10 days after alcohol exposure in mouse embryos. This may explain, at least in part, the peptides' prevention of neurodevelopmental anomalies in FAS.","2010-05","2019-02-14 12:34:14","2019-02-14 12:34:14","","457.e1-4","","5","202","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Animal Studies; Models, Biological; Mice; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome -- Metabolism; Oligopeptides -- Pharmacodynamics; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome -- Prevention and Control; Nerve Tissue Proteins -- Metabolism; Neuroprotective Agents; Oligopeptides -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that physiologic factors such as low energy expenditure and physical activity would be present in AA compared with white women in pregnancy. Objective: We aimed to identify physiologic risk factors for disordered energy balance in AA and white women early in pregnancy. Design: This was a cross-sectional study in 66 pregnant women with obesity, between 14 and 16 wk of gestation. Energy intake was calculated using the intake-balance method. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)] over 7 d with the use of doubly labelled water and during sleep [sleeping EE (SleepEE)] in a room calorimeter. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical activity by accelerometers.Markers of metabolic health were obtained from fasting blood and urine. Results: AA (n = 34) and white (n = 32) women were comparable in age (mean ± SEM: 27.7 ± 0.6 y), enrollment body mass index [mean ± SEM (in kg/m2): 36.9 ± 0.7], and body fat (mean ± SEM: 45.0%±0.6%). AA women had more fat-freemass (P=0.01) and tended to be more insulin-resistant (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, P = 0.06). Energy intake was signifi- cantly lower in AA than in white women (2499 ± 76 compared with 2769 ± 58 kcal/d, P = 0.001), although absolute TDEE was comparable (AA: 2590 ± 77 kcal/d; white: 2711 ± 56 kcal/d; P = 0.21). After adjusting for body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231 ± 74 kcal/d, P = 0.003), as was SleepEE (-81 ± 37 kcal/d, P = 0.03). Physical activity, substrate oxidation, and metabolic biomarkers (triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations, catecholamine excretion) were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions: Body mass-adjusted energy expenditure is significantly lower in AA than in white pregnant women. Energy intake recommendations for pregnancy do not consider this difference and may therefore overestimate energy requirements in AA women. This may lead to unintentional overeating and contribute to the disparity of excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention that is more prevalent in AA women.

Using polysomnography, we examined the predictive capacity of screening questionnaires (Berlin) in pregnancy. Incorporating simultaneous fetal heart rate monitoring (FHM), we examined the association of maternal apnea with FHM abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 100 pregnant women at 26-39 weeks of gestation with OSA screening and baseline data ascertainment who underwent polysomnography and FHM for > or =3 hours. The relationship between maternal characteristics, OSA, and FHM was explored with multivariate analyses that were controlled for potential confounders. RESULTS: When compared with polysomnography, sensitivity and specificity by Berlin screening was 35% and 63.8%, respectively; the snoring component of the Berlin correlated better with oxygen desaturation <95% (P = .003). Body mass index was a significant confounder (r(s) = 0.44; P < .0001). No association was observed between FHM abnormalities and OSA parameters.

Estimating fatigue severity with a psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for understanding women's fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: The study was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within three months postpartum. Results: The C-LFS-SF showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ≥ .97) and stability over the 7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient > .87). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 88-94% of the total variance was explained by the one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct validity. Conclusions: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk pregnancies or with medical conditions.","2014-07","2019-02-14 12:34:21","2019-02-14 12:34:21","","1027-1035","","7","51","","International Journal of Nursing Studies","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Expectant Mothers; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Coefficient Alpha; Psychological Tests; Scales; Taiwan; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Postnatal Period; Prenatal Care; Health Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Diaries; Mothers; Severity of Illness Indices; Validation Studies; Internal Consistency; Instrument Validation; Factor Analysis; Content Validity; Accelerometry; Quantitative Studies; Postnatal Care; Test-Retest Reliability; Intraclass Correlation Coefficient; Construct Validity; Criterion-Related Validity; Discriminant Validity; Fatigue -- Symptoms; Symptom Distress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Obstetrical research has measured sleepiness in pregnant women with the ESS, although psychometric analyses and dimensionality evaluations have never been conducted with this population.Objective: The objective was to perform a psychometric evaluation of the ESS in an obstetric population. The design was a secondary data analysis of the subjects enrolled in the Prenatal Exposures and Preeclampsia Prevention III (PEPP) study. The setting for the subjects who received prenatal care was at Magee-Women's Hospital UPMC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and included 337 pregnant women in their first trimester that completed the ESS.Methods: Principal components analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed using SPSS and M-Plus. Additionally, reliability was assessed and construct validity was measured using the Life Orientation Test (LOT). Lastly, a relationship between daytime sleepiness and snoring was investigated using item 5e from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).Results: PCA with varimax rotation yielded two factors that explained approximately 50% of the variance and CFA results verified this two-factor solution. An overall Cronbach's alpha (0.751) revealed moderate reliability (Factor 1α=.754; Factor 2α=.524). Both convergent and discriminant validity were established.Conclusion: The ESS is appropriate for use in an obstetric population to measure daytime sleepiness. Future work should include additional evaluations of the ESS in a diverse group of pregnant women.","2013-01","2019-02-14 12:34:22","2019-02-14 12:34:22","","116-121","","1","14","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Young Adult; Pregnancy Complications -- Diagnosis; Sleep Disorders -- Diagnosis; Psychological Tests; Scales; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Psychometrics; Pregnancy Complications -- Physiopathology; Factor Analysis; Sleep Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors; Reproducibility of Results; Sleep Disorders -- Physiopathology; Pregnancy Trimester, First -- Psychosocial Factors; Pregnancy Trimester, First -- Physiology; Wakefulness -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During interview, we ascertained information about lifestyles, demographics, sleep characteristics, and mood symptoms. Stress induced sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assessment scales, respectively. Consistency indices, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlations, and logistic regressions were used.Results: Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a three-factor solution: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and sleep medication. We observed significantly positive correlations of the PSQI with the FIRST (0.42), the PHQ-9 (0.49), and the GAD-7 (0.46). Poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5) had significantly increased odds of experiencing stress-induced sleep disturbance (odds ratio, OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.40, 5.31), depression (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 3.58, 8.37), and generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.57; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.76).Conclusion: The Spanish-language version of the PSQI instrument was found to have good construct validity among pregnant Peruvian women. Consistent with some other studies, the PSQI was found to have a three-factor structure. Further assessment and validation studies are needed to determine whether the three, factor-specific scoring of the PSQI is favored over the PSQI global score in diverse populations.","2015-08","2019-02-14 12:34:23","2019-02-14 12:34:23","","869-877","","8","11","","Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A convenient sample consisting of 100 primiparous women interviewed on admission to the labor and delivery unit of a large suburban hospital was obtained. These women were interviewed three times at two-hour intervals during labor unless they delivered before these time periods or were administered epidural anesthesia. The final interview was within twenty-four hours of delivery. The subjective, cognitive and physiological dimensions of fatigue were measured by the Fatigue Symptom Checklist and Visual Analogue Scales, the Digit Span Subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (revised R), and a hand held bulb dynamometer. A repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated that fatigue significantly increased as labor progressed. Fatigue was found to be high for these women as a group when they were admitted to the hospital and it continued to increase during labor. A canonical correlation was computed to determine the best predictors for fatigue. The predictor set of variables included: (1) whether the woman took formal childbirth education classes; (2) the amount of sleep; (3) whether she exercised during the last trimester of pregnancy; (4) whether she worked during the last trimester of pregnancy; (5) her state and trait levels of anxiety; and (6) whether she had been medicated prior to the interview. On admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were, state anxiety, amount of sleep, trait anxiety, and medication. Two hours after admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were previous fatigue, medication and work. Four hours after admission, the variables were medication, previous fatigue, exercise and childbirth education. Six hours after admission, the predictors with the greatest influence were previous fatigue, medication, exercise and work. Within 24 hours after delivery, the greatest predictor of fatigue was previous fatigue. There was a positive correlation between fatigue scores on admission and subsequent fatigue scores during labor. Women who had strong contractions reported significantly higher levels of fatigue at 2, 4 and 6 hours after admission. Women who used intense pattern of breathing exercises reported significantly higher levels of fatigue than those who used slow chest breathing. The total length of labor was significantly correlated with fatigue scores after delivery.","1990-01","2019-02-14 12:34:23","2019-02-14 12:34:23","","","272 p","","","","","","","","","","UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AT BALTIMORE","","","","","c8h","UMI Order PUZ9014660","EBSCOhost","","PH.D.","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Descriptive Research; Human; Convenience Sample; Primiparas; Research Instruments; Analysis of Variance; Childbirth Education; Anxiety -- In Pregnancy; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Exercise -- In Pregnancy; Fatigue -- In Pregnancy; Labor; Breathing Exercises -- In Pregnancy; Canonical Correlation Analysis; Psychophysiology -- In Pregnancy; Uterine Contraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main outcome measures were scores on the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) and the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R).Results: During pregnancy, 80% of the samples endorsed at least one item on the PDI, and 76% endorsed at least one item on the LSHS-R. Endorsement rates were lower postnatally, with rates of 59% and 52% for the PDI and LSHS-R, respectively. Mean scores on the PDI were 3.07 during pregnancy and 1.61 postnatally. Mean scores on the LSHS-R were 8.38 during pregnancy and 5.24 postnatally. Hierarchical multiPLEs regression analyses revealed that ratings of depressive symptomatology significantly predicted PDI total score during pregnancy and LSHS-R total score postnatally, whilst postnatally, scores obtained on the PDI and LSHS-R postnatally were significantly predicted by scores on these measures during pregnancy. Fear in childbirth, but not in pregnancy, showed associations with PLEs but these associations were not maintained once multivariate analyses were conducted.Conclusions: The results of this study support the continuum model of psychosis, by illustrating that PLEs occur frequently in perinatal individuals without a diagnosis of severe mental illness.","2014-12","2019-02-14 12:34:25","2019-02-14 12:34:25","","118-123","","1-3","160","","Schizophrenia Research","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Prevalence; Psychological Tests; Pregnancy Trimester, Third -- Psychosocial Factors; Postnatal Period -- Psychosocial Factors; Early Diagnosis; Psychotic Disorders -- Diagnosis; Psychotic Disorders -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Medical and surgical advances have increased the number of CHD adult survivors, which may create quality-of-life (QOL) issues not previously considered. Quality-of-life issues pertinent to this patient population involve health and life insurance acquisition, birth control, genetic counseling, pregnancy concerns, employment, and independent living arrangements. The purpose of this study was to describe the QOL of adults with CHD. The study used a prospective cross-sectional case-control design to examine QOL using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). The study participants were a sample of 124 adults with CHD from an outpatient cardiology clinic in a metropolitan university-affiliated teaching hospital in the Northeast and 124 matched healthy control subjects. Between the participants and the matched control subjects, there was a significant difference in the total mean SIP score, the physical and psychosocial dimension scores, and all the category scores (P < 0.05). The areas of life the adults with CHD reported as lacking in quality involved the categories of work (SIP of 11.1, moderate disability) and sleep and rest (SIP of 9.03, mild disability). The results of this study indicate that the SIP can be used for quantitative and subjective QOL assessment of adults with CHD. It is suggested that cardiac advanced practice nurses use the results of this study to develop appropriate information, counseling, and anticipatory guidance for this patient population.","2003-02","2019-02-14 12:34:27","2019-02-14 12:34:27","","42-53","","1","14","","AACN Clinical Issues: Advanced Practice in Acute & Critical Care","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Behavior Rating Scales; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Adult; Human; Outpatients; Convenience Sample; Male; Middle Age; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Mail; Paired T-Tests; Academic Medical Centers; Random Sample; Outpatient Service; Quality of Life -- Evaluation; Research Subject Recruitment; Advanced Practice Nurses; Cardiac Patients -- Classification; Cardiac Patients -- Psychosocial Factors; Heart Defects, Congenital -- Classification; Heart Defects, Congenital -- In Adulthood; Heart Defects, Congenital -- In Middle Age; New England; Nonresponse Bias; Sickness Impact Profile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination (Thompson) scores were calculated.Results: Twenty-eight infants participated (mean gestational age 39.0 ± 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho = 0.54, p = 0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p > 0.1). Higher state entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho = -0.43, p = 0.023). Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities were also related to examination scores.Conclusions: Among critically ill neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded sleep-including analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentation-showed associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.","2014-02-04","2019-02-14 12:34:29","2019-02-14 12:34:29","","390-395","","5","82","","Neurology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Human; Infant, Newborn; Male; Sleep Stages -- Physiology; Infant, Premature; Brain -- Physiology; Polysomnography -- Methods; Critical Illness; Electroencephalography -- Methods; Nervous System Diseases -- Diagnosis; Nervous System Diseases -- Physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data were used to analyze linear trends in prone, lateral, and supine infant sleep positioning among 14,648 mother-infant pairs from 1996 to 2007. Logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of prone and lateral positioning among 9,015 mother-infant pairs from 2000 to 2007. From 1996 to 2007, white infants experienced a reduction in both prone and lateral positioning and an increase in supine positioning (28.2-66.7%), while black infants had smaller decreases in prone and lateral positioning and a smaller increase in supine positioning (22.6-47.1%) than white infants. Compared to births in 2000-2005, births after the explicit recommendation that infants not be placed in the lateral sleep position (2006-2007) were associated with decreased odds of lateral positioning among white infants (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51, 0.87) but not among black infants. The significant predictors of white infants being placed in the prone position were different from the predictors for black infants. Additionally, with regard to lateral sleep positioning, more significant predictors were observed among white infants than black infants. These findings suggest that efforts are warranted to increase the prevalence of supine sleep positioning, especially among black infants. Race-specific programs may efficiently reduce non-supine sleep positioning to help narrow racial gaps in sudden infant death syndrome.","2012-01","2019-02-14 12:34:31","2019-02-14 12:34:31","","72-82","","1","16","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Infant; Sudden Infant Death -- Ethnology; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Male; Data Analysis Software; Confidence Intervals; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Blacks; Prone Position; Random Sample; Whites; Supine Position; Hispanics; Lateral Position; South Carolina; Sudden Infant Death -- Mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in early-life risk factors for childhood obesity. METHODS: A total of 1343 white, 355 black, and 128 Hispanic mother-child pairs were studied in a prospective study. Mother's reported child's race/ethnicity. The main outcome measures were risk factors from the prenatal period through 4 years old that are known to be associated with child obesity. RESULTS: In multivariable models, compared with their white counterparts, black and Hispanic children exhibited a range of risk factors related to child obesity. In pregnancy, these included higher rates of maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 1.55 for black, 1.89 for Hispanic); in infancy more rapid weight gain (OR: 2.01 for black, 1.75 for Hispanic), more likely to introduce solid foods before 4 months of age (OR: 1.91 for black, 2.04 for Hispanic), and higher rates of maternal restrictive feeding practices (OR: 2.59 for black, 3.35 for Hispanic); and after 2 years old, more televisions in their bedrooms (OR: 7.65 for black, 7.99 for Hispanic), higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (OR: 4.11 for black, 2.48 for Hispanic), and higher intake of fast food (OR: 1.65 for black, 3.14 for Hispanic). Black and Hispanic children also had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding and were less likely to sleep at least 12 hours/day in infancy.

Study objectives were to estimate prevalence of sleep disorders and to examine racial/ethnic differences in sleep disorders, reporting of sleep issues, and amount of sleep among women of child-bearing age (15-44 years) in the US. Methods Through a secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010 (3175 non-pregnant, 432 pregnant women in main analysis), prevalence of sleep disorders, reporting of sleep disorders to a physician/health professional, and amount of sleep were estimated overall, by pregnancy status, and by race/ethnicity stratified by pregnancy status. Racial/ethnic differences in reporting of trouble sleeping by pregnancy status were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among women of childbearing age was 4.9 % [3.9 % pregnant; 5.1 % non-pregnant ( p < 0.01)]. Significantly fewer pregnant and non-pregnant minority women reported adequate sleep (7-8 h) than non-Hispanic white (white) women ( p < 0.05). Among non-pregnant women, odds of report of trouble sleeping were significantly higher for white compared to black (aOR 0.47 [95 % CI 0.36, 0.61]) or Mexican-American women (aOR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.21, 0.41]); non-pregnant minority women were also significantly less likely to report trouble sleeping than white women when controlling for amount of sleep.

Illinois has developed an innovative model in which programs utilizing evidence-based home-visiting models incorporate community doulas who focus on childbirth education, breastfeeding, pregnancy health, and newborn care. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the impact of doula-home-visiting on birth outcomes, postpartum maternal and infant health, and newborn care practices. Methods 312 young (M = 18.4 years), pregnant women across four communities were randomly assigned to receive doula-home-visiting services or case management. Women were African American (45%), Latina (38%), white (8%), and multiracial/other (9%). They were interviewed during pregnancy and at 3-weeks and 3-months postpartum. Results Intervention-group mothers were more likely to attend childbirth-preparation classes (50 vs. 10%, OR = 9.82, p < .01), but there were no differences on Caesarean delivery, birthweight, prematurity, or postpartum depression. Intervention-group mothers were less likely to use epidural/pain medication during labor (72 vs. 83%; OR = 0.49, p < .01) and more likely to initiate breastfeeding (81 vs. 74%; OR = 1.72, p < .05), although the breastfeeding impact was not sustained over time. Intervention-group mothers were more likely to put infants on their backs to sleep (70 vs. 61%; OR = 1.64, p < .05) and utilize car-seats at three weeks (97 vs. 93%; OR = 3.16, p < .05). Conclusions for practices The doula-home-visiting intervention was associated with positive infant-care behaviors. Since few evidence-based home-visiting programs have shown health impacts in the postpartum months after birth, incorporating doula services may confer additional health benefits to families.","2018-10-02","2019-02-14 12:34:34","2019-02-14 12:34:34","","105-113","","1","22","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Human; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; T-Tests; Confidence Intervals; Random Assignment; Randomized Controlled Trials; Maternal-Child Health; Illinois; Case Management; Doulas; Home Visits -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infant overweight predisposes child, adolescent, and adult to obesity. We hypothesized that parent education, initiated prenatally and provided in the home, would reduce the incidence of infant overweight at age 12 months. METHODS: Pregnant obese Latina women were recruited at Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and randomized to intervention versus control. Intervention subjects received home visits by trained Spanish-fluent community health workers who provided counseling on infant growth, breastfeeding, nutrition, child development, sleep, physical activity, and safety. Promotoras did not visit the control subjects. A research assistant collected outcome data on all subjects. RESULTS: Compared to controls, parent education did not reduce infant overweight. Infant overweight developed rapidly and was present in 46% of infants by age 6 months. Infants overweight at 6 months were likely to be overweight at age 12 months (r = 0.60, P < .0001). Overweight was more common in formula-fed infants at ages 6 months (P < .06) and 12 months (P = .005). Breastfeeding was less common in families with employed mothers (P = .02) and unemployed fathers (P < .01), but the father living with the mother at the time of the prenatal visit predicted successful breastfeeding at infant age 2 months (P < .003). Compared to formula feeding, overweight at age 12 months was 2.7 times less likely for infants breastfed for ≥2 months (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of success of the intervention may be explained in part by a high cesarean section rate in the intervention group, food and employment insecurity, and confounding by WIC breastfeeding promotion, which was available to all mothers. Breastfeeding was the most important mediator of infant overweight. The study supports efforts by WIC to vigorously promote breastfeeding.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:34:36","2019-02-14 12:34:36","","324-333","","3","18","","Academic Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Infant; Human; Random Assignment; Randomized Controlled Trials; Counseling; Breast Feeding; Infant Development; Infant Formula; Parents -- Education; Community Health Workers; Latin America; Pediatric Obesity -- Prevention and Control -- In Infancy and Childhood; Special Populations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Related measurements collected before and after birth, and during childhood and adolescence can provide a life-course analysis of important factors that contribute to health and behaviour in young adulthood. The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study has collected a large number of such measurements during the fetal, perinatal, infancy, childhood and adolescence periods and plans to relate them to common health issues and behaviours in young adults, including spinal pain, asthma, sleep disorders, physical activity and sedentary behaviour and, work absenteeism and presenteeism. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, design and methods of the 22 year follow-up of the Raine Study cohort. Methods/design: The Raine Study is a prospective cohort study. Participants still active in the cohort (n = 2,086) were contacted around the time of their 22nd birthday and invited to participate in the 22 year follow-up. Each was asked to complete a questionnaire, attend a research facility for physical assessment and an overnight sleep study, wear activity monitors for a week, and to maintain a sleep and activity diary over this week. The questionnaire was broad and included questions related to sociodemographics, medical history, quality of life, psychological factors, lifestyle factors, spinal pain, respiratory, sleep, activity and work factors. Physical assessments included anthropometry, blood pressure, back muscle endurance, tissue sensitivity, lung function, airway reactivity, allergic status, 3D facial photographs, cognitive function, and overnight polysomnography. Discussion: Describing the prevalence of these health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will enable better recognition of the issues and planning of health care resources. Providing a detailed description of the phenotype of these issues will provide valuable information to help educate health professionals of the needs of young adults. Understanding the life-course risk factors of health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will have important health planning implications, supporting the development of targeted interventions to improve current health status and reduce the onset and development of further ill-health across adulthood.","2015-01","2019-02-14 12:34:37","2019-02-14 12:34:37","","663-663","","1","15","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given current estimates, ≈10% of adolescents have hypertension or prehypertension. In addition to obesity, dietary salt intake and waist circumference, a marker of visceral obesity, are found to be independently associated with the rise in BP among children and adolescents. Dietary salt intake in urban children is well above recommended levels largely because of consumption of processed and fast foods. Childhood exposures, such as stress,52 salt, and fructose, as well as lifestyles, including food sources, sleep patterns, and reductions in physical activity may have a role in obesity-high BP associations. In addition, clinical and translational evidence is mounting that intrauterine exposures alter can effect changes in fetal development that have an enduring effect on cardiovascular and metabolic function later in life. These effects can be detected even in children who are products of a term otherwise normal pregnancy. Hypertension in childhood has been defined statistically (BP ≥ 95th percentile) because of lack of outcome data that links a BP level with heightened risk for future cardiovascular events. Therefore, primary hypertension had been considered a risk factor for later hypertension in adulthood. Intermediate markers of TOD, including cardiac hypertrophy, vascular stiffness, and increases in cIMT, are detectable in adolescents with primary hypertension. Evidence that vascular injury is present in the early phase of hypertension and even in prehypertension warrants consideration on the current definition of pediatric hypertension. With further studies on TOD and other risk factors in addition to high BP, it may be possible to shift from a statistical definition to a definition of childhood hypertension that is evidence based. Preventing or reducing childhood obesity would have substantial benefit in countering the documented increase in BP levels and prevalence of high BP in childhood. Weight control in overweight and obese children, along with dietary changes 53 and increases in physical activity,54 has benefit on BP levels in childhood. Prevention of childhood obesity and BP risk will require multiple levels of intervention, including public health, health policy, and attention to food supply to foster the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent and reduce childhood obesity.","2015-05","2019-02-14 12:34:38","2019-02-14 12:34:38","","926-931","","5","65","","Hypertension (0194911X)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Child; Hypertension -- Epidemiology; Hypertension -- Physiopathology; Life Style; Blood Pressure; Disease Progression; Hypertension -- Etiology; Morbidity -- Trends; Research, Medical -- Trends; World Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the most common brain malformation with an incidence of 1:250 during embryogenesis; however, owing to the associated high rates of spontaneous abortion the incidence is 1:16,000 among live deliveries. Pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly is complex and heterogeneous involving genetic abnormalities, teratogenic exposures, and syndromic associations. Among the teratogenic exposures, maternal diabetes is a well-established risk factor associated with a 200-fold increased incidence of holoprosencephaly.Case Presentation: We report a case of a delayed diagnosis of semilobar holoprosencephaly in a 12-month-old baby boy of African descent who presented to us with a history of global developmental delay, erratic sleep patterns, and poor weight gain. He was born to a type 1 diabetes mellitus mother at 39+ weeks by emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress and breech presentation. The baby weighed 2315 g and had Apgar scores of 6/10 and 8/10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. A physical examination done at 12 months of age revealed a small-for-age child with a developmental age of 2 months. He had normal facies but a neurological examination revealed hypotonia in all four limbs. The rest of systemic examination was unremarkable. Hematological and biochemical investigations revealed normal findings except for iron deficiency anemia. The child also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of his brain which revealed distinctive features of semilobar holoprosencephaly. He was treated for iron deficiency anemia with Hemovit syrup (ferric ammonium citrate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin, and zinc sulfate) 10 ml thrice daily, ferrous sulfate 10 mg once daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily, and multivitamin syrup 5 ml once daily. Furthermore, nutritional and genetic counseling was offered to his parents.Conclusions: In conclusion, although rare, holoprosencephaly is the commonest structural anomaly of the brain with a complex and multifactorial etiopathogenesis. It is prudent to diagnose it prenatally, classify its severity, and forge its prognosis so that parents are counseled early enough to make informed decisions especially where termination of pregnancy may be implicated.","2016-12-20","2019-02-14 12:35:17","2019-02-14 12:35:17","","1-6","","","10","","Journal of Medical Case Reports","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Infant; Male; Scales; Clinical Assessment Tools; Child Development; Brain -- Pathology; Apgar Score; Cesarean Section; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 -- Physiopathology; Pregnancy in Diabetes -- Physiopathology; Abnormalities, Multiple; Abnormalities, Multiple -- Physiopathology; Anemia, Iron Deficiency -- Diet Therapy; Brain -- Abnormalities; Genetic Counseling; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Nutrition Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has been a result of the advances in technology for study of brain development and the sensory systems specifically. While the basic physcial structure of the sensory receptors (i.e. eyes, ears etc.) develops early in gestation, most of the neurosensory development occurs in the last sixteen to twenty weeks. The neurological processes are not accelerated by preterm birth. Preterm birth accelerates the maturation of the kidney, gastrointestinal, lung and cardiovascular function but does not alter the sequence or timing of neurodevelopment. The stresses and the environment of the Newborn Intesive Care Unit (NICU) play a major role in the altered neurodevelopment observed in preterm infants. The brain development in the fetus, neonate, and infant includes not just sensory systems but motor systems, social/emotional systems, and the cognitive systems. These systems are connected and integrated during development. The development of the brain, both structure and function, is shaped by the influence of four major factors or processes. These inlude (1) the genetic endowment and the epigenetic effects from the environment, (2) the endogenous or internal brain activity and sleep, (3) external experiences and stimulation of the sensory organs, and (4) the physical, chemical, sensory, and social/emotional environments. These factors operate on and influence the development of each of the brain systems. These effects depend on age and developmental level of the particular system. Many of the processes and stimulations needed to facilitate brain development can result in adverse effects if exposure is at the wrong time in development or the level of intensity is not appropriate. The NICU inviroment can have very adverse consequences for healthy nuerodevelopment. It is essential that the invironment of the fetus, neonate, infant be adapted and managed to provide for the healthy early brain development.

METHOD: A prospective case-control study recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27 women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about pregnancy and delivery complications. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying, jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for <3 h after a feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the special care nursery. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome.","2009-09","2019-02-14 12:35:19","2019-02-14 12:35:19","","846-854","","9","43","","Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Infant, Newborn; Chi Square Test; Psychological Tests; Relative Risk; Confidence Intervals; Clinical Assessment Tools; P-Value; Substance Abuse, Perinatal; Antidepressive Agents -- Therapeutic Use -- In Pregnancy; Central Nervous System -- Physiopathology; Serotonin -- Adverse Effects -- In Utero; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Progesterone, one of the key hormones in pregnancy, a known respiratory drive stimulant, increases ventilation and may protect against OSA. We aimed to examine the relationship between circulating progesterone and OSA, after accounting for body weight and gestational age. Methods: A case control study was conducted of pregnant women with OSA and those at low risk for the disorder. Cases were identified by ICD-9 code and review of medical record. Controls were identified if they scored zero (never) for snoring, apnea, and gasping on the multivariable apnea prediction index questionnaire immediately following delivery. Subjects with available stored first and/or second trimester residual serum samples were then included in this study and serum analyzed for progesterone. Raw progesterone levels were adjusted for the effects of gestational age and maternal weight. Results: Twenty-seven cases and 64 controls with available serum were identified. Women with OSA had greater maternal weight and higher rates of related comorbidities, compared to controls. Progesterone levels correlated positively with gestational age and negatively with greater weight. Progesterone levels, adjusted for gestational age and maternal weight and expressed as multiples of median (MoM), were significantly lower in OSA cases compared to controls in both the first trimester (MoM = 0.71, confidence interval [95% CI] 0.60-0.83) relative to the MoM in controls of 1.00. In the second trimester levels were also lower in OSA cases (MoM = 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96) compared to the MoM of 1.00 in controls. Conclusions: Progesterone levels, after accounting for weight and gestational age, were lower in women with OSA than controls. Progesterone may play a protective role against OSA.","2017-03","2019-02-14 12:35:20","2019-02-14 12:35:20","","259-265","","3","26","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Body Weight; Polysomnography; Convenience Sample; Funding Source; Fisher's Exact Test; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; T-Tests; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Confidence Intervals; Record Review; Retrospective Design; Gestational Age; Obesity; Multicenter Studies; Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; Snoring; Medical Records; International Classification of Diseases; Rhode Island; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- In Pregnancy; Academic Medical Centers -- Rhode Island; Progesterone -- Blood -- In Pregnancy; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to compare the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated maternal blood-pressure responses in late pregnancy with the nonpregnant state.Design:Case-controlled, longitudinal study of sleep-disordered breathing during late pregnancy and postpartum.Study Patients:Ten women referred for suspected sleep-disordered breathing during the third trimester of pregnancy.Interventions:None.Measurements and Results:Full overnight polysomnography and continuous systemic blood pressure were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and 3 months following delivery. Parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, including apnea hypopnea index and minimum overnight arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, were compared between antenatal and postnatal studies. An improvement in both apnea-hypopnea index and minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation occurred consistently in all subjects postnatally. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, mean apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 63 +/- 15 per hour antenatally to 18 +/- 4 per hour postnatally (P = .03), and in rapid eye movement sleep, from 64 +/- 11 per hour to 22 +/- 4 per hour (P = .002). Minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was increased from 86% +/- 2% antenatally to 91% +/- 1% postnatally (P = .01). Arterial blood-pressure responses to apnea peaked at 170 to 180 mm Hg antenatally, while they only peaked at 130 to 140 mm Hg postnatally.Conclusion:This study indicates that late pregnancy may be associated with increased severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated blood-pressure responses.","2005-06","2019-02-14 12:35:21","2019-02-14 12:35:21","","737-2]","","6","28","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Adult; Human; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Polysomnography; T-Tests; Education, Continuing (Credit); Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- In Pregnancy; Labor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adult-onset metabolic disorders may begin during early development and exhibit substantial sex dimorphism. We hypothesized that metabolic dysfunction induced by gestational SF in male mice would not be apparent in female littermates.Methods: Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly in male and female offspring after late gestational SF or control sleep (SC). At 20 weeks, plasma leptin, adiponectin, lipid profiles, and insulin and glucose tolerance tests were assessed. Leptin and adiponectin, M1, and M2 macrophage messenger RNA expression and polarity were examined. Adiponectin gene promoter methylation levels in several tissues were assessed.Results: Food intake, body weight, visceral fat mass, and insulin resistance were higher, and adiponectin levels lower in male but not female offspring exposed to gestational SF. However, dyslipidemia was apparent in both male and female offspring exposed to SF, albeit of lesser magnitude. In visceral fat, leptin messenger RNA expression was selectively increased and adiponectin expression was decreased in male offspring exposed to gestational SF, but adiponectin was increased in exposed female offspring. Differences in adipokine expression also emerged in liver, subcutaneous fat, and muscle. Increased M1 macrophage markers were present in male offspring exposed to SF (SFOM) while increased M2 markers emerged in SF in female offspring (SFOF). Similarly, significant differences emerged in the methylation patterns of adiponectin promoter in SFOM and SFOF.Conclusion: Gestational sleep fragmentation increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in male but not in female offspring, most likely via epigenetic changes. Thus, sleep perturbations impose long-term detrimental effects to the fetus manifesting as sex dimorphic metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.","2015-04","2019-02-14 12:35:22","2019-02-14 12:35:22","","545-557","","4","38","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm disruption might impair fetal growth or lead to complications of pregnancy. Two independent meta-analyses (from 2000 to 2007) reported a small adverse effect of shift work on the risk of preterm delivery (PTD). However, these reviews were based on few high-quality studies.Objectives: To provide an updated review of the associations of shift work with PTD, low birthweight (LBW), small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and pre-eclampsia.Search Strategy and Selection Criteria: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE using combinations of keywords and MeSH terms.Data Collection and Analysis: For each relevant paper we abstracted standard details, used to summarise design features and rate methodological quality. We calculated pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) in random-effect meta-analyses.Main Results: We retrieved 23 relevant studies. The pooled estimate of RR for PTD was 1.16 (95% CI 1.00-1.33, 16 studies), but when five reports of poorer methodological quality were excluded, the estimated RR decreased to 1.03 (95% CI 0.93-1.14). We also observed increased RRs for LBW (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93-1.74) and for SGA (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22), which varied little by study quality. Little evidence was found on pre-eclampsia.Conclusions: These findings suggest that overall, any risk of PTD, LBW, or SGA arising from shift work in pregnancy is small.","2011-11","2019-02-14 12:35:22","2019-02-14 12:35:22","","1429-1437","","12","118","","BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Infant, Newborn; Risk Factors; Relative Risk; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Pre-Eclampsia -- Epidemiology; Childbirth, Premature -- Epidemiology; Work","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aggregate data were available from eight studies, n = 17,308 (seven with self-reported and one with objectively measured sleep duration). Meta-analysis was applied for pooling aggregate data using a random-effects model. Identified authors provided individual patient data (IPD) from four studies with objectively measured sleep duration, n = 287. A one-stage approach with a hierarchical mixed-effect logit model was applied to pool IPD across studies. Aggregate data analysis revealed that women with short sleep duration (<6-7 h) were more likely to have GDM than women without short sleep duration, odds ratio 1.70 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.33). IPD analysis demonstrated that, compared to sleeping >6.25 h, women who slept ≤6.25 h had higher 1-h glucose levels after 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing by 0.65 mmol/L (0.18, 1.13) and an increased risk of GDM, adjusted odds ratio 2.84 (1.25, 6.44).

We evaluated sleep problems in preterm infants 6 months of post-gestational age using the subjective Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and objective sleep tests. We also compared the sleep of premature infants with that of full-term infants.Methods: The study included 68 6-month-old full-term healthy infants and 191 premature infants born at <37 weeks gestation. All parents completed the BISQ-Chinese version and sleep diaries. At the same time, all premature infants were submitted to one night of polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory and also were set up with an actigraph kept for 7 days. Statistical analyses were performed using correlation coefficients and the t-test with SPSS version 18 to compare questionnaire responses with other subjective and objective measures of sleep.Results: The sleep problems indicated in the subjective questionnaire for the premature infants, particularly: ""the nocturnal sleep duration, number of night awakenings, daytime sleep duration, duration of time with mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing"" had significant correlations with sleep diaries, actigraphy and PSG results. The BISQ showed that duration of infant's sleeping on one side, nocturnal sleep duration, being held to fall asleep, number of nighttime awakenings, daytime sleep duration, subjective consideration of sleep problems, loud-noisy breathing, and duration spent crying during the night were significantly different between the premature infants and the term infants. PSG confirmed the presence of a very high percentage (80.6%) of premature infants with AHI > 1 event/hour as indicated by the questionnaire.Conclusion: Premature infants have more sleep problems than full-term infants, including the known risk of abnormal breathing during sleep, which has been well demonstrated already with the BISQ-Chinese (CBISQ).","2014-01","2019-02-14 12:35:28","2019-02-14 12:35:28","","303-303","","1","14","","BMC Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Population-based. PARTICIPANTS: All women (n = 4191) who had delivered at Stavanger University Hospital from October 2005 to September 2006 were mailed a questionnaire seven weeks postpartum. The response rate was 68% (n = 2830). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The prevalence of sleep problems, defined as PSQI > 5, was 57.7%, and the prevalence of depression, defined as EPDS > or = 10, was 16.5%. The mean self-reported nightly sleep duration was 6.5 hours and sleep efficiency 73%. Depression, previous sleep problems, being primiparous, not exclusively breastfeeding, or having a younger or male infant were factors associated with poor postpartum sleep quality. Poor sleep was also associated with depression when adjusted for other significant risk factors for depression, such as poor partner relationship, previous depression, depression during pregnancy and stressful life events. Sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality were the aspects of sleep most strongly associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep was associated with depression independently of other risk factors.

In this article we review what is known about changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum 'blues,' depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited.

One important but often overlooked change is the increased risk for sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence to suggest that women with significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, are more likely to report an increase in depressive symptomatology or develop postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD.Recent Findings: Symptoms of insomnia and poor sleep quality are independently associated with greater depressive symptoms across pregnancy and throughout postpartum. Likewise, both can negatively impact the ability to mother effectively.Summary: The presence of insomnia or sleep disturbance during the perinatal period is a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Women with depression are at an increased risk of developing sleep disturbance thereby increasing depressive symptomatology. This bidirectional and additive relationship needs more clinical attention as both sleep disturbance and depression are noted risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes.","2015-11","2019-02-14 12:35:31","2019-02-14 12:35:31","","490-496","","6","28","","Current Opinion in Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Scales; Insomnia -- Psychosocial Factors; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Depression, Postpartum -- Complications; Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index; Impact of Events Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Berlin Questionnaire is a validated tool for identifying people at risk for OSAS. The aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of OSAS in women and to estimate the risk for OSAS among females in the United States. METHODS: This is an analysis of data from the 2007 Sleep in America Poll of the National Sleep Foundation. The NSF Poll is an annual telephone survey of a representative sample of U.S. adults. The 2007 NSF Poll included 1254 women in the United States, with an oversample of pregnant and postpartum women. We used the Berlin Questionnaire to estimate the risk for OSAS among the U.S. female population. This instrument includes questions about self-reported snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, hypertension, and obesity. Also included were questions about sleep habits, sleep problems, menstrual cycle status, and other medical disorders. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of the female population was found to be at high risk for OSAS. Among women at high risk, such common symptoms of OSAS as habitual snoring (61%), observed apneas (7%), and daytime sleepiness (24%) were highly prevalent. Sleep onset insomnia (32%) or maintenance insomnia symptoms (19%) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms (33%) or body movements (60%) also were frequently reported. The risk increased with age (p < 0.05), obesity (p < 0.001), and menopause (p < 0.001). The presence of chronic medical disorders was more frequently reported among women at high risk. CONCLUSIONS: One in four women in America is at high risk of having OSAS. Awareness by the primary care medical community of this disorder in females should thus be increased.","2009-08","2019-02-14 12:35:37","2019-02-14 12:35:37","","1211-1219","","8","18","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Questionnaires; Human; Age Factors; Funding Source; Restless Legs; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Relative Risk; Confidence Intervals; Obesity; Women; Survey Research; Random Sample; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Symptoms; Menopause; Insomnia; Telephone; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Risk Factors; Failure to Diagnose","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighty percent of our patients reported being bothered by their nocturia episodes1. Despite distress caused by nocturia, patients often consider the symptom to be trivial and not worth raising during a medical consultation.2-3 Nocturia is associated with sleep disturbance and is known to produce daytime fatigue, impair cognitive function and psychomotor performance, and to compromise safety. A significant relationship exists between daytime sleepiness and falls. In a review of causality of nocturia, we noted that severity of nocturia was associated with greater impairment on a global sleep assessment, frequency and degree of snoring and increased drowsiness. Obstructive sleep apnoea in women was a significant predictor of nocturia ≥ 2 (OR 4.99 95% CI 2.49-10.0). Snoring was reported to have the highest sensitivity for nocturia in men and second highest after obesity in women. Insomnia and restless leg syndrome were both independently predicted by nocturia.4 The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between validated sleep measures and frequency of nocturia in patients attending a continence service for help with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). A secondary aim was to identify key sleep variables that should be collected in all patients with co-existing nocturia. Materials & method: A nested dataset from 94 continence patients completing the TANGO Long Form, a self-completed 56-item nocturia questionnaire, was used for this study. Inclusion criteria were nocturia at least once per night and age 40 years or older. Individuals with conditions associated with atypical nocturia were ineligible for inclusion i.e. being medically unstable, receiving end-of-life-care, terminal malignancies, end stage renal disease, bladder cancer, previous pelvic radiotherapy and pregnancy. Individuals with dementia or cognitive impairment that precluded completing a questionnaire were also ineligible. Data were entered into SPSS (V23) and stratified by severity of nocturia. Discriminating items from the Insomnia Severity Index, Stop-Bang Obstructive Sleep Apnea metric along with the entire Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index were inspected for frequency of endorsement. Values were compared to community based norms. General health and mobility were captured by the EQ-5D-3L Health Status questionnaire and the SF-36 Health Status item. Items with a high ""floor effect"", i.e. >70% of responders endorsed ""never"" or its equivalent, where > 50% data was missing or with an inter-relationship >0.8 were identified. Severe nocturia, i.e. three or more episodes per night, was modelled using the sleep variables in order to identify any significant or independent predictors. Results: Table 1 (Table 1: Demographic and sleep characteristics stratified by nocturia severity.) shows the demographic information and sleep characteristics stratified by frequency of nocturia. Most sleep variables did not differ between mild and severe nocturia. Significant differences were seen in regular sleep latency beyond 30 minutes, insomnia, overall sleep quality and length of time to the initial nocturia episode. The symptoms of daytime urinary urgency and urge incontinence were significantly more prevalent in nocturia of >3 per night compared to <2. Regression analysis on the number of nocturia episodes explained 37% of the variance and retained the following variables: sum of three insomnia index items (p=0.047), time to first nocturia episode (p=0.009), sudden urinary urgency daily (p=0.029). Conclusions: This study identifies information that can be used to address sleep co-morbidities in patients with nocturia. Sleep variables explain less than half of the variance of nocturia frequency in our population, meaning that waking at night is unlikely to be attributable only to sleep issues in continence patients. This is supported by the significance of urgency in the model. We suggest that clinicians routinely asking about sleep latency beyond 30 minutes, primary and secondary insomnia, and estimating whether the patient sleeps for at least three hours before the initial nocturia episode, will capture clinically relevant sleep dysfunction.","2016","2019-02-14 12:35:39","2019-02-14 12:35:39","","97-98","","4","22","","Australian & New Zealand Continence Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Odds Ratio; Sleep; Questionnaires; Human; Data Analysis Software; Severity of Illness Indices; Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36); Severity of Illness; Urinary Incontinence; Urination Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women occupy an increasingly prominent place in the work force without reducing most of their responsibilities at home. Consequently, sleep needs are often pushed to the bottom of women's daily priority list. Prior research has indicated that sleep deprivation is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum cytokines. This is important because higher plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory serum cytokine levels are associated with postpartum depression and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm delivery. However, little research has directly examined how sleep deprivation may affect maternal and fetal outcomes. This review summarizes the existing data on the effect of sleep deprivation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes. We review supporting evidence for the hypotheses that sleep deprivation during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm delivery and postpartum depression, and that systemic inflammation is the causal mechanism in the association. Prior research on sleep in pregnancy has been limited by varying data collection methods, subjective self-reported sleep measures, small and non-representative samples, cross-sectional designs; descriptive or non-hypothesis driven studies. Future research with longitudinal study designs is needed to allow examination of the effect of sleep deprivation on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.","2010-04","2019-02-14 12:35:42","2019-02-14 12:35:42","","107-114","","2","14","","Sleep Medicine Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Physiopathology; Childbirth, Premature -- Physiopathology; Depression, Postpartum -- Etiology; Depression, Postpartum -- Psychosocial Factors; Childbirth, Premature -- Etiology; Sleep Deprivation -- Complications; Pregnancy Outcomes -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inclusion criteria were women with singleton neonates liveborn between 20 and 44 weeks of gestation without chromosomal abnormalities or major structural birth defects linked to a hospital discharge database maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development and without mental illness during pregnancy. Sleep disorder was defined based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code (n=2,265). Propensity score matching was used to select a referent population at a one-to-one ratio. Odds of preterm birth were examined by gestational age (less than 34 weeks, 34-36 weeks, and less than 37 weeks of gestation) and type (spontaneous, indicated).Results: Prevalence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) was 10.9% in the referent group compared with 14.6% among women with a recorded sleep disorder diagnosis. Compared with the referent group, odds (95% CI, P value, percentage) of preterm birth were 1.3 (1.0-1.7, P=.023, 14.1%) for insomnia and 1.5 (1.2-1.8, P<.001, 15.5%) for sleep apnea.

Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Recent research has suggested that women with GH may have an increased rate of SDB during pregnancy, but it is not known if this higher rate of SDB persists into the postpartum state. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether women with GH continue to have an increased rate of SDB compared to healthy pregnant women, after the physiologic changes of pregnancy resolve. METHODS: We previously studied women with GH and uncomplicated pregnancies with sleep questionnaires and level 1 polysomnography. Participants were invited to participate in repeat testing 1-2 years postpartum. Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) differences were assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects (11 GH and 7 healthy) had complete follow-up data available for comparison with antepartum data. This group was representative of the initial antepartum cohort. Women with GH experienced a decrease in mean RDI from antepartum to postpartum (12.0 ± 12.3 vs 2.9 ± 2.9; P = 0.02). Healthy women did not experience the same change (2.8 ± 5.3 vs 2.1 ± 3.2; P = 0.81). Postpartum comparisons showed the mean RDI of women with GH had decreased to be similar to that of healthy women (P = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: SDB in women with gestational hypertension improved in the postpartum state to levels indistinguishable from our healthy subjects. This suggests that the physiologic effects of pregnancy may have had a pathologic role in the development of antepartum SDB in women with GH.

A biomarker of preeclampsia, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, has come to prominence in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between continuous positive airway pressure treatment, sleep disordered breathing and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations during pregnancy. Methods A 38-year-old G1P0 presented at 20 + 5 weeks. She had a history of chronic hypertension. Sleep studies revealed she had sleep disordered breathing with an AHI of 7.3/h. She was commenced on continuous positive airway pressure. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations and blood pressure recordings were taken at various points during her pregnancy. Results She did not develop preeclampsia or require an escalation in her antihypertensives. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations rose 16% from a low baseline.

Physiological changes of pregnancy predispose a woman ‘at risk’ towards developing SDB. The increasing incidence of OSA in pregnancy closely correlates with the population trends of obesity. Common screening tools validated in non-pregnant subjects including Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) are poor predictors of SDB in pregnancy. Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are linked with SDB. Preeclampsia and OSA share common pathological associations. It is unclear if one predisposes the other. Foetal morbidity includes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, low birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and Apgar score of less than seven at one minute. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a well-documented treatment of SDB in pregnancy and has been shown to reverse some of the adverse events. It becomes imperative to diagnose and manage this condition as OSA causes substantial morbidity in the untreated pregnant patient and foetus.

With regard to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), variations in symptoms may cause misdiagnoses and delay of appropriate treatment. The prevalence of OSA appears to increase markedly after the time of menopause. Although OSA as defined by the numbers of apneas/hypopneas may be less severe in women, its consequences are similar and perhaps worse. Therapeutic issues related to gender should be factored into the management of OSA. The prevalence of insomnia is significantly greater in women than in men throughout most of the life span. The ratio of insomnia in women to men is approximately 1.4:1.0, but the difference is minimal before puberty and increases steadily with age. Although much of the higher prevalence of insomnia in women may be attributable to the hormonal or psychological changes associated with major life transitions, some of the gender differences may result from the higher prevalence of depression and pain in women. Insomnia's negative impact on quality of life is important to address in women, given the high relative prevalence of insomnia as well as the comorbid disorders in this population. Gender differences in etiology and symptom manifestation in narcolepsy remain understudied in humans. There is little available scientific information to evaluate the clinical significance and specific consequences of the diagnosis of narcolepsy in women. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs or other limbs during periods of rest or inactivity and may affect as much as 10% of the population. This condition is more likely to afflict women than men, and its risk is increased by pregnancy. Although RLS is associated with impaired quality of life, highly effective treatment is available.","2008-09","2019-02-14 12:35:51","2019-02-14 12:35:51","","1191-1199","","7","17","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; District of Columbia; Age Factors; Pregnancy Complications; Depression; Restless Legs -- Drug Therapy; Prevalence; Sleep Disorders; Women's Health; Quality of Life; Life Change Events; Pain; Diagnostic Errors; Gender Specific Care; Insomnia -- Symptoms; Insomnia -- Trends; Narcolepsy -- Symptoms; Postmenopause; Seminars and Workshops -- District of Columbia; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Trends; Treatment Delay","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships of both gestational weight gain and pre-pregnancy BMI to objective and subjective measures of sleep during late pregnancy. Methods Pregnant women (n=128) were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth classes primarily serving low-income women. Their sleep (disruption and duration) was objectively assessed in their last month of pregnancy with 72 hours of wrist actigraphy monitoring. Their perceived sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pre-pregnancy and late pregnancy height and weight were assessed by self-report and used to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain, which were then grouped into standardized categories. Results Mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was 6.8 ± 3.1 (range 2-16). Sixty percent had excess gestational weight gain and it was associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, but was unrelated to objective measures of sleep duration and disruption. Pre-pregnancy BMI was unrelated to all sleep parameters. However, analyses of the interaction of pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain indicated that excess weight gain was associated with shorter sleep duration and more sleep disruption, but only among women who were overweight before pregnancy.

Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors.Methods: Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI)), were collected thrice from pregnant women (N=161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10-12 weeks), T2 (14-16 weeks) and T3 (18-20 weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were dichotomised using established clinical cut-offs.Results: BMI and BP significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL≥20 min had greater BMI than women without persistent SOL≥20 min prior to covariate adjustment at T1 and T2, but at T3 the BMI values converged. Similar results were observed for persistent WASO≥30 min. Persistently long WASO, as measured by actigraphy, was associated with elevated SBP, after controlling for covariates.Conclusions: Consistent with anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report substantial difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep during early pregnancy and this may augment the risk of higher BP and BMI. Understanding these relationships is important as CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for appropriate intervention.","2014-04","2019-02-14 12:35:56","2019-02-14 12:35:56","","444-450","","4","15","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; United States; Young Adult; Pregnancy Complications -- Diagnosis; Risk Factors; Insomnia -- Diagnosis; Statistics; Gestational Age; Pregnancy Complications -- Physiopathology; Blood Pressure -- Physiology; Reference Values; Actigraphy; Body Weight -- Physiology; Wakefulness -- Physiology; Insomnia -- Physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Thirty-five nulliparous women were recruited from childbirth preparation classes. Sleep was measured with wrist actigraphy continuously until hospital admission for delivery. Participants completed self-report measures of pain and fatigue in early labor prior to hospital admission. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Most women experienced spontaneous labor onset during the night. Sleep quality deteriorated progressively over the last 5 days of pregnancy, and was the lowest on the night before hospital admission. This was the case even when labor was induced (40%). CONCLUSION: There was a significant relationship between the amount of sleep the night before hospitalization and pain perception in women with spontaneous labor onset.

However, relatively little is known about sleep disturbances among pregnant migraineurs. We investigated sleep disturbances among pregnant women with and without history of migraine.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1324 women who were recruited during early pregnancy. Migraine diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep-related characteristics including sleep duration, sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and other sleep traits. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Migraineurs were more likely than non-migraineurs to report short sleep duration (<6.5 hours) (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.02), poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.35-2.23), and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.12-2.02). Migraineurs were also more likely than non-migraineurs to report taking sleep medication during pregnancy (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.20-2.42).

The odds of sleep disturbances were particularly elevated among pre-pregnancy overweight migraineurs.Conclusion: Migraine headache and sleep disturbances are common comorbid conditions among pregnant women.","2015-10-15","2019-02-14 12:35:59","2019-02-14 12:35:59","","1092-1102","","12","35","","Cephalalgia","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Pregnancy Complications -- Diagnosis; Funding Source; Middle Age; Sweden; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Scales; Obesity -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Comorbidity; Causal Attribution; Migraine -- Epidemiology; Migraine -- Diagnosis; Obesity -- Diagnosis; Patient History Taking -- Statistics and Numerical Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Data were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth. All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester, women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth.

The plant contains alkaloids, of which cathinone and cathine have structural similarity and pharmacological action similar to amphetamines. The leaves are, therefore, consumed in some regions as a psychoactive stimulant due to cultural beliefs and misperceptions on the health benefits of khat consumption. This resulted in a growing prevalence of khat consumption among pregnant women. The myriad of physiological changes associated with pregnancy impairs sleep and memory. Moreover, khat has also been shown to have adverse effects on memory and sleep. Therefore, its use during pregnancy may further aggravate those impairments. The purpose of this mini-review is to summarize the changes in sleep and memory during pregnancy and the evidence supporting a relationship between khat consumption and neurocognitive deficits and sleep dysfunctions. The misperceptions of beneficial effects of khat, the high prevalence of consumption among pregnant women, and the possibility of under-reporting of khat abuse do necessitate the development of alternative methodologies to identify cases of unreported khat abuse in pregnant women. It is proposed that screening for sleep problems and memory deficits may help identify under-reported cases of khat abuse in pregnant women.","2017-10","2019-02-14 12:36:00","2019-02-14 12:36:00","","247-251","","4","12","","Annals of Thoracic Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cultural Values; Memory -- Drug Effects -- In Pregnancy; Plants -- Adverse Effects -- In Pregnancy; Psychotropic Drugs -- Adverse Effects -- In Pregnancy; Sleep Disorders -- Chemically Induced -- In Pregnancy; Substance Abuse -- Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, available data on the association between sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women are sparse and methodological limitations have been acknowledged. The purpose of the study was to examine objective and self-reported sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in a group of healthy pregnant women. Methods A total of 274 third-trimester pregnant women wore a wrist actigraph continuously for 7 days to assess objective sleep quality and quantity. Self-reported sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI), with self-reported poor sleep quality defined as a PSQI score more than 5. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale ( CES-D) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to evaluate symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Results Sixty-four (23.4%) women were at risk for clinical depression and 69 (25.2%) had daytime sleepiness. Risk of clinically meaningful depressive symptomatology was significantly increased in women with objective total nighttime sleep less than 6 hours ( OR 2.53 [95% CI 1.26-5.08]) and self-reported poor sleep quality ( OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.74-6.30]), even after multiple adjustment. Neither objective nor self-reported sleep disturbances increased daytime sleepiness in this group of pregnant women. Discussion Both objective nighttime sleep less than 6 hours and self-reported poor sleep quality in healthy third-trimester pregnant women is associated with significant risks for clinical depression. Improving sleep would likely be associated with a reduction in depression symptom severity and an attenuation of the prevalence of depression in pregnant women.","2016-06","2019-02-14 12:36:02","2019-02-14 12:36:02","","176-183","","2","43","","Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Descriptive Research; Human; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Psychological Tests; Scales; Self Report; Taiwan; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Confidence Intervals; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Accelerometers; Multiple Logistic Regression; Translations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in 108 women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT).Results: Of the participants, 41% had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] >8); 64% had poor sleep quality; 25% snored frequently; 29% had increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB); 52% experienced short sleep (SS); 19% had both increased SDB risk and SS (SDB/SS); and 14% had daytime dysfunction. Reported sleep duration inversely correlated with glucose values from 50-g OGTT (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). Each hour of reduced sleep time was associated with a 4% increase in glucose levels. Increased likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was found in subjects with increased SDB risk (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI 1.2-7.4]), SS (2.4 [1.0-5.9]), SDB/SS (3.4 [1.3-8.7]), and frequent snoring (3.4 [1.3-8.8], after adjustment for BMI).

Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy.Methods: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181) groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained.Results: Depressed women had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values≤.05). However, the frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values≤.05).Conclusions: At 20 and 30 weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms.","2011-08","2019-02-14 12:36:57","2019-02-14 12:36:57","","676-685","","8","28","","Depression & Anxiety (1091-4269)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Adolescence; Adult; Young Adult; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Risk Factors; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Psychological Tests; Depression -- Diagnosis; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Pregnancy Complications -- Drug Therapy; Severity of Illness Indices; Depression -- Drug Therapy; Sleep Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors; Sleep Disorders -- Physiopathology; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors -- Therapeutic Use; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors -- Adverse Effects; Antidepressive Agents, Second Generation -- Adverse Effects; Antidepressive Agents, Second Generation -- Therapeutic Use; Pregnancy Complications -- Chemically Induced; Sleep Disorders -- Drug Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Women wore an actigraph and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Glucose records were compared against the objective sleep data. Linear mixed model analysis was used to estimate the association of sleep duration on morning fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations.Results: Thirty-seven participants provided data for 213 sleep intervals that corresponded to at least one glucose reading.

Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated the association between sleep duration and diet quality, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education. Results Thirty-four percent of women reported short, 57.1 % adequate, and 8.6 % long sleep duration. The average diet quality total score was 47.4 out of 100. Short sleep duration was not associated with diet quality. Long sleep duration was associated with lower quality diet (β = −4.3; 95 % CI −8.1 to −0.4), lower consumption of total fruit (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.1), whole fruit (β = −0.9; 95 % CI −1.6 to −0.2), and total protein (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.03), and higher consumption of empty calories (β = 2.2; 95 % CI −4.3 to −0.1). Conclusions for practice Future studies should examine the longitudinal association between sleep duration and diet quality among women following childbirth and whether interventions to improve sleep can enhance diet quality.","2016-09","2019-02-14 12:37:04","2019-02-14 12:37:04","","1869-1877","","9","20","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Marital Status; Age Factors; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Scales; Self Report; Postnatal Period; Educational Status; Confidence Intervals; Surveys; Childbirth; Analysis of Variance; Mothers; Food Habits; Linear Regression; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Race Factors; Food Intake; Diet -- In Pregnancy; Confounding; Diet Records; Multi-Stage Cluster","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently, reduced sleep duration has gained significant attention for its possible contribution to metabolic dysfunction. Significant evidence suggests that reduced sleep duration may elevate the risk for impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, to date, few studies have determined the implications of reduced sleep duration with regard to glucose control during pregnancy. With the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age, the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM results in elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications, as well as increased risk of type 2 diabetes postpartum. Infants born to women with GDM also carry a life-long risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of reduced sleep on glucose management during pregnancy has not yet been fully assessed and a paucity of literature currently exits. Herein, we review the association between reduced sleep and impaired carbohydrate metabolism and propose how reduced sleep during pregnancy may result in further dysfunction of the carbohydrate axis. A particular focus will be given to sleep-disordered breathing, as well as GDM-complicated pregnancies. Putative mechanisms of action by which reduced sleep may adversely affect maternal and infant outcomes are also discussed. Finally, we will outline important research questions that need to be addressed.","2013-06","2019-02-14 12:37:04","2019-02-14 12:37:04","","765-770","","6","37","","International Journal of Obesity","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; United States; Infant, Newborn; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Postnatal Period; Time Factors; Obesity -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Etiology; Sleep Deprivation -- Metabolism; Sleep Deprivation -- Epidemiology; Obesity -- Complications; Sleep Deprivation -- Complications; Pregnancy Complications -- Metabolism; Insulin Resistance; Obesity -- Metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 -- Epidemiology; Blood Glucose -- Metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 -- Etiology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 -- Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods From 2010 to 2012, 12 506 women in Tianjin, China, were screened using a 50-g 1-h glucose challenge test at 24-28 weeks' gestation. Those with glucose challenge test values of ≥ 7.8 mmol/l were invited to further undergo a 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational diabetes was determined according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group's definition. Self-reported sleep duration and sleep quality during pregnancy was documented using a modified questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios and 95% CIs. Results A total of 919 women (7.3%) had gestational diabetes. Sleep duration was found to have an approximate J-shaped association with gestational diabetes risk after adjusting for covariates. Compared with a sleep duration of 7-9 h/day (43% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios for sleep duration of ≥ 9 h/day (55%) and < 7 h/day (2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.21 (95% CI 1.03-1.42) and 1.36 (95% CI 0.87-2.14), respectively.

At the time of interview we ascertained participants' migraine diagnosis status and collected information about sleep duration before and during early pregnancy, daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and perceived stress during early pregnancy. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of short/long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, vital exhaustion and elevated perceived stress associated with a history of migraine.Results: Approximately 19.4% of the cohort (n = 259) reported having a medical diagnosis of migraine prior to the study pregnancy. Compared with women without migraine, the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CI) among migraineurs for short sleep duration before and during early pregnancy were 1.51 (1.09-2.09), and 1.57 (1.11-2.23), respectively. The corresponding OR (95% CI) for long sleep duration before and during pregnancy were 1.33 (0.77-2.31) and 1.31 (0.94-1.83), respectively. A modest and statistically insignificant association between migraine history and excessive daytime sleepiness in early pregnancy was noted (OR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.94-2.26). Migraineurs had an increased risk of vital exhaustion (OR = 2.04; 95% CI 1.52-2.76) and elevated perceived stress (OR = 1.57; 95% CI 1.06-2.31).

We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep to assess alterations in the functional neuroanatomy of executive processes in adolescents born very preterm. The topographical distribution of sleep slow wave activity (SWA; 1-4.5 Hz EEG power) has previously been used to map cognitive abilities and is known to reflect the intensity of the prior use of the respective neuronal networks. We assessed 38 adolescents born before 32 weeks of gestation [age at assessment: 12.9 (SD: 1.7), range: 10.6-16.7 years] and 43 term-born peers [13.1 (2.0), 10.0-16.9]. Executive function abilities were quantified with a composite score derived from a comprehensive task battery. All-night high-density EEG (128 electrodes) was recorded and SWA of the first hour of sleep was calculated. Abilities were significantly poorer in the very preterm compared to the term-group, particularly, if the tasks demands were high (p < .01). The score was positively correlated with sleep SWA in a cluster of 15 electrodes over frontal and negatively in a cluster of 14 electrodes over central brain regions after controlling for age at assessment and correcting for multiple comparisons. Within the frontal cluster, sleep SWA was higher in very preterm compared to term-born participants when controlling for executive function performance and age at assessment (p = .02). No difference in SWA between very preterm and term-born participants was found for the central cluster (p = .29). Our results demonstrate a local increase of sleep SWA over brain regions associated with executive processes in adolescents born very preterm compared to similarly performing term-born peers. Thus, sleep SWA seems to map the higher effort needed for executive function tasks in adolescents born very preterm.","2017-01","2019-02-14 12:37:12","2019-02-14 12:37:12","","11-21","","","86","","Cortex: A Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System & Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Child; Adolescence; Male; Sleep -- Physiology; Infant, Premature; Brain -- Physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Executive Function; Electroencephalography -- Methods; Brain Mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The home-based Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy consisted of 4 weeks of sound-enhanced audio relaxation programs, readings, and daily sleep diaries. Both control groups received dietary recommendations for improving sleep. Sleep duration (total sleep time) and sleep disruption (wake after sleep onset) were measured using wrist actigraphy for a minimum of 48 hours on consecutive weekdays.Results: The intervention group had significantly longer sleep duration and less sleep disruption than both control groups, particularly at the postpartum assessment. Intervention participants slept an average of 430 (95% confidence interval [CI] 397-464) minutes during pregnancy compared with 420 (95% CI 403-438) and 417 (95% CI 395-439) minutes for the two control groups.

Physiological, hormonal, and emotional changes associated with pregnancy often lead to sleep disturbance. Women who develop antepartum complications frequently are prescribed bed rest and hospitalization. Both pregnancy and hospitalization can influence sleep. This study examined the sleep experience of hospitalized antepartum women. The purposes of this descriptive correlational study were to determine whether being in the hospital affects sleep in pregnant women, gestational age influences sleep while hospitalized, and patient's usual sleep patterns influence sleep during hospitalization. A conceptual model of impaired sleep for the childbearing family provided theoretical guidance.A convenience sample of 24 pregnant women, 18-39 years of age, participated in the study. Most participants were unmarried minority women with annual incomes of less than $30,000. Difficulties in retaining participants to Day 4 were encountered; only 9 participants completed the study to Day 4.Most participants had existing sleep disturbances, according to PSQI and GSDS scores on admission. Women self-reported both internal and external factors that interrupted their sleep during hospitalization. There was a moderate, inverse relationship between the weeks of gestation and how well the participants slept the previous night on Day 3. Perceptions of sleep depth and sleep quality increased significantly over time. Self-reported difficulty in falling asleep the previous night significantly decreased over time.Recommendations for future research are modification of the design to include all women admitted and discharged prior to Day 4, larger sample size, and the use of objective and subjective measures in data collection.","2013-01","2019-02-14 12:37:14","2019-02-14 12:37:14","","","235 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Texas at Arlington","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3598026","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Convenience Sample; Sleep Disorders; Hospitalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gestational perturbations promote the emergence of adiposity and metabolic disease risk in offspring, most likely through epigenetic modifications. Adiponectin (AdipoQ) expression inversely correlates with obesity and insulin resistance. The effects of SF during late gestation on metabolic function and AdipoQ expression in visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) of offspring mice are unknown. Male offspring mice were assessed at 24 weeks after dams were exposed to SF or control sleep during late gestation. Increased food intake, body weight, VWAT mass, and insulin resistance, with reductions in AdipoQ expression in VWAT, emerged in SF offspring. Increased DNMT3a and -b and global DNA methylation and reduced histone acetyltransferase activity and TET1, -2, and -3 expression were detected in VWAT of SF offspring. Reductions in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and H3K4m3 and an increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K9m2 in the promoter and enhancer regions of AdipoQ emerged in adipocytes from VWAT and correlated with AdipoQ expression. SF during late gestation induces epigenetic modifications in AdipoQ in male offspring mouse VWAT adipocytes along with a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype. Thus, altered gestational environments elicited by SF impose the emergence of adverse, long-lasting metabolic consequences in the next generation.","2014-10","2019-02-14 12:37:15","2019-02-14 12:37:15","","3230-3241","","10","63","","Diabetes","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Body Weight; Male; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Sleep Deprivation -- Metabolism; Blood Glucose; Animal Studies; Sleep Deprivation; Insulin Resistance; Mice; Eating; Adiponectin; Adiponectin -- Metabolism; Genes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the demographical shifts, African American women have now emerged as one of the fastest growing HIV populations today, yet they remain a vulnerable and underrepresented population in the sleep literature.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the dynamics of HIV--related sleep disruption and wellbeing in asymptomatic HIV--seropositive AA women of childbearing age within the context of a holistic, theoretical substruction from Myra Levine's Conservation Model (1967). The rationale for the proposed study was to provide a foundation of both the objective and subjective experience of HIV--related sleep disruption, which as a stressor can affect wellbeing.METHODS: A descriptive correlational design was used to examine the immunological integrity, sleep/wake rhythm, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, IL--6 rhythm, and quality of life in 20 asymptomatic HIV--seropositive African American women receiving care at Wayne State University Physicians Group Infectious Diseases Clinic in Detroit, MI. In this 4--day protocol, measures included CD4+ cell count, HIV RNA viral load, wrist actigraphy, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Subjective Sleep Quality Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, plasma IL--6, Quality of Life Index, and Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale.RESULTS: Both the objective and subjective experience of sleep demonstrated severe sleep disruption and disorganized sleep patterns. Nearly half (45%) of the sample slept < 6 hours per night, usually not falling asleep until sometime after 12 midnight. Objective daytime functioning was also disrupted with frequent dozing (> 9 sleep episodes) noted throughout the day. Self--reported daytime sleepiness was inconsistent with the objective assessment and was within normal limits. The sample's mean IL--6 level was 2.03 pg/mL, which is much lower than that reported in other asymptomatic samples or normal controls. Quality of life measures indicated a positive sense of wellbeing, but the daily pattern of quality of life was not associated with the daily pattern of sleep efficiency, subjective sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, or IL--6 levels when controlling for CD4+ cell count and HIV RNA viral load. And lastly, the 1--item quality of life scale showed agreement with the 66--item quality of life index using Bland--Altman agreement analysis, which may help in decreasing participant burden in clinical trials enrolling this population.CONCLUSION: This sample suffered from severe HIV-related sleep disruption, as evidenced by an average sleep time of 6.4 hours per night and frequent dozing throughout the day.

Idiosyncrasies, including changes that occur with the biological life cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, make the understanding of sleep in women an important topic to study. Each phase of a woman's life, from childhood to menopause, increases the risk of sleep disturbance in unique ways that may require distinct management. Indeed, new research is unraveling novel aspects of sleep pathology in women and the fundamental role that sex hormones play in influencing sleep regulation and arousals and possibly outcomes of sleep conditions.

Multiple factors across a woman's lifespan, including hormonal changes, age-related physiological changes, psychosocial factors, the presence of sleep disorders, and physical and mental health conditions, can contribute to complaints of poor sleep in women. This article reviews the literature on the characteristics of, and contributing factors to, subjectively and objectively measured sleep during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and post-partum period, as well as the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Evidence from both subjective and objective measurements supports the presence of chronic sleep fragmentation associated with pregnancy, acute sleep deprivation during labour and the immediate post-partum periods, as well as disrupted sleep during the first few months after childbirth. While there is evidence for menstrual cycle and menopause related sleep disturbance based on women's self report, findings from objectively measured sleep have been mixed. Observational and intervention studies on the relationship between sleep and women's psychological well-being suggest that underlying causes of sleep disturbance across a woman's lifespan are often multi-factorial. Comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions are needed in managing sleep problems in women. Cognitive behavioural interventions have been shown to reduce sleep complaints during the perinatal and menopausal periods, and improvements in sleep are likely to lead to improvements in women's overall well-being.","2015-02","2019-02-14 12:37:21","2019-02-14 12:37:21","","14-24","","1","50","","Australian Psychologist","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Postnatal Period; Sleep Disorders; Psychological Well-Being; Women; Menopause; Menstrual Cycle; Behavior Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnant acculturated Mexican-American women are more likely to engage in unhealthy prenatal behaviors relative to those less acculturated, including poor sleep. As sleep disruptions are associated with acculturation and negative perinatal outcomes, particularly maternal depression, alterations in sleep may adversely affect pregnant Mexican-American women. Methods Sixty pregnant women of Mexican descent completed surveys about sleep, acculturation, depressive symptoms and potential protective factor of social support. Results Acculturation, but not social support, significantly predicted increased sleep disruptions as well as overall feeling less refreshed upon waking across pregnancy. Moderation analysis indicated that more acculturated women who took longer to fall asleep reported increased depressive symptoms. Feeling refreshed upon waking also mediated the relationship between increased acculturation and elevated maternal depressive symptoms. Conclusions Acculturation and altered sleep contribute to greater risk in Mexican-American women for maternal depressive symptoms in the perinatal period.

Questionnaires were used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms.Results: Mothers of co-sleeping infants reported more infant night-wakings than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping group.

Extensive research on its prevention and management reveals that corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and cytokines play significant roles in the development of preterm labor. These substances also influence sleep, suggesting a possible, but previously unexplored, association between sleep pattern changes and preterm labor. Thus, in order to begin a systematic examination of this potentially important relationship, this study explored subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women.The Bi-Dimensional Stress Model, which describes the influence of physiological and psychosocial stress in stimulating the immune and endocrine responses associated with preterm birth, provided the theoretical framework for this study. The design consisted of a convenience sample of 220 subjects participating in a descriptive, prospective, comparative study. Subjects completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during routine antenatal visits in the second trimester of pregnancy. Delivery outcome data identified those subjects who delivered preterm.Sleep latency, a component of the PSQI and a measure of the period from 'lights out' to sleep onset, was longer in those who delivered preterm compared to those who delivered at term. The daytime dysfunction score, a component of the PSQI and a measure of problems with maintenance of alertness, was higher in those who experienced a term delivery. No differences were detected between the preterm and term groups in the total scores of the other primary variables (PSQI, ESS, and PSS), in the other sleep variables measured by the PSQI (sleep efficiency, total sleep time), or in the other component scores of the PSQI. The preterm group reported more cigarette smoking, previous preterm births, and experienced more twin gestations than the term group. However, only previous preterm birth and sleep latency were predictive of preterm birth.This study represents the first investigation to explore the potential relationship between sleep and preterm labor. Outcomes from this research suggest a possible, relationship between sleep onset insomnia and preterm birth. In addition, recommendations for further research are identified.","2004-01","2019-02-14 12:37:27","2019-02-14 12:37:27","","","205 p","","","","","","","","","","Emory University","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3123367","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Descriptive Research; Human; Convenience Sample; Comparative Studies; Scales; Childbirth, Premature -- Etiology; Conceptual Framework; Sleep Disorders -- Complications -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, population-based study. SETTING: Passo Fundo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 2,285 newborns. INTERVENTIONS: Perinatal information was collected from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Application of the score allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age < or = 20 years (p < .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p < .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk sleep practices were widely observed in the study population.

Demographics and medical variables were also collected. Compared to Canadian normative data, our sample scored significantly poorer on the following HRQoL domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning. Multivariate linear regressions were used to model each of the SF-36 subscales. Experiencing sleep problems emerged as a significant determinant of poorer HRQoL in all domains, with the exception of emotional role. Higher depressed mood scores was independently associated with lower HRQoL in six of the eight domains, including bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Greater pregnancy-related anxiety was independently associated with lower scores on physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health problems. Women experience lower HRQoL during pregnancy, particularly in the physical domains. The importance of identifying and managing modifiable determinants early in pregnancy to enhance maternal health status is discussed.","2010-06","2019-02-14 12:37:31","2019-02-14 12:37:31","","249-257","","3","13","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Canada; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Scales; T-Tests; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Quality of Life -- In Pregnancy; Depression -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Linear Regression; Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36); Multivariate Analysis; Interview Guides; Stress, Psychological; Sleep Disorders -- In Pregnancy; Affective Disorders -- Complications -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the aims of the present study are to clarify first trimester sleep quality and sleepiness characteristics, and to elucidate the affects of stress on sleep and sleepiness characteristics.MethodsSelf-administered questionnaires were distributed to 46 first trimester expectant mothers who were recruited from outpatient departments of two hospitals in Hiroshima, Japan between April 2007 and January 2008. The questionnaire was composed of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a sleep log, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).ResultsThe average global score of the PSQI (PSQIG) was 6.67 (+/-3.20), and 65.2% of participants exceeded the cut-off score. Participants with higher perceived stress had significantly higher PSQIG scores (r=0.38, n=46, p<0.01). There was a positive correlation with PSQIG (r=0.40, n=46, p<0.01) and regularity of bedtime, indicating that participants with well-regulated daily habits have lower PSQIG scores. The average ESS score was 10.1 (+/-4.3), with 50.0% of participants scoring 11 points or higher. Moreover, primipara had higher scores than multipara (un-paired t (44)=2.52, p <0.05), and those participants with more children had lower scores (r=-0.32, n=46, p<0.05). Sleepiness duration and nap duration were not significantly different for parity. For employment (employed or not-employed), nap duration was significantly different (un-paired t (27)=2.27, p<0.05), however, there was no significant difference in sleepiness duration.ConclusionThis study has shown that first trimester expectant mothers have markedly poor sleep quality and higher levels of sleepiness when compared to women of the same age in the general population. In addition, this study suggests that sleep quality is improved by controlling stress and by having well regulated sleep habits.","2008-12","2019-02-14 12:37:36","2019-02-14 12:37:36","","180-188","","2","22","","Journal of Japan Academy of Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Expectant Mothers; Scales; Primiparas; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Diaries; Japan; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Multiparas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These pathologies are aggravated by sympathetic nervous system activation and may be related to stress. The present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of and changes in sleep quality and stress in pregnant women with PIH and GDM during the second and third trimesters. Methods We enrolled 56 women in their second or third trimesters who were diagnosed with PIH or GDM. Participants completed questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Secretory immunoglobulin A (SlgA) concentrations were measured as a biological indicator of stress. Results PSS scores and subjective stress parameters were significantly higher than those reported from previous studies of healthy pregnant women (15.2 points and 15.1 points for the second and third trimesters, respectively). Mean one-day values for SIgA were 168.3 and 205.7 μg/mL for the second and third trimesters, respectively. During the second and third trimesters, SIgA scores were higher than those reported for healthy pregnant women in previous studies. The PSQI component scores sleep disturbance (C5) and sleep duration (C3) in follow up case were significantly higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester. Discussion This investigation suggests that pregnant women with PIH and GDM experience higher stress levels than do non-pregnant women and healthy pregnant women. Further, our results indicate that sleep quality worsens during the third trimester compared with the second trimester.","2014-09","2019-02-14 12:37:37","2019-02-14 12:37:37","","190-195","","3","27","","Women & Birth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Scales; Clinical Assessment Tools; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Complications; Sleep Disorders -- Etiology -- In Pregnancy; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Complications; Stress, Psychological -- Etiology -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated sleep quality during pregnancy and assessed associated factors, especially depressive and anxiety symptoms.Material and Methods: A total of 78 healthy pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were studied twice prospectively during pregnancy (in mid-pregnancy and late pregnancy). Sleep quality was evaluated by the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, depressive symptoms by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and anxiety symptoms by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.Results: Poor general sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings per night, and too-early morning awakenings increased in late pregnancy compared with mid-pregnancy (all p-values < 0.020). The total insomnia score (p < 0.001) and sleep latency increased (p = 0.005), but sleep duration and preferred sleep duration did not change. Women tended to snore more often in late pregnancy, but apneas remained rare. Almost one-fourth of the women reported both morning and daytime sleepiness, but the frequencies did not increase during the follow up. In late pregnancy, depressive and anxiety symptoms were cross-sectionally related to sleep disturbances, but depressive or anxiety symptoms in mid-pregnancy were not associated with sleep disturbances in late pregnancy.Conclusions: We found deterioration in sleep quality across pregnancy. However, no increase in negative daytime consequences was found, presumably indicating a compensatory capacity against sleep impairment. Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were only cross-sectionally associated. Our study calls for further research on the factors that influence sleep disturbances during pregnancy.","2017-02","2019-02-14 12:37:39","2019-02-14 12:37:39","","198-206","","2","96","","Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Body Mass Index; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Young Adult; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Maternal Age; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Pregnancy Trimesters; Parity; Depression -- Complications; Snoring -- Complications; Anxiety -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer patients frequently suffer from poor sleep quality. Bryophyllum pinnatum is a herbal medication used in anthroposophic medicine, which has been shown to be associated with improvements in sleep quality during pregnancy with only few and minor or moderate side-effects reported. In this study, the sleep quality of cancer patients during treatment with B pinnatum was investigated. Study Design. In this prospective, observational study, cancer patients suffering from sleep problems were treated with B pinnatum (350 mg tablets, corresponding to 50% of leaf pressed juice [Weleda AG, Arlesheim, Switzerland], dosage at physician’s consideration, but most frequently 2 tablets with evening meal and 2 before going to bed). Methods. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), daily sleepiness (Epworth Sleeping Scale [ESS]), and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and after 3 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. From the 28 recruited patients, 20 completed both questionnaires and were considered in the present analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Results. Patients were 61 ± 10.4 years old and the majority were female (17 out of 20). During treatment with B pinnatum, the PSQI decreased from 12.2 ± 3.62 to 9.1 ± 3.61 (P < .01), and ESS changed from 8.4 ± 3.18 to 7.1 ± 3.98 (P < .05). There was no change in FSS. The treatment was well tolerated by the majority of patients, with only 6 patients reporting discomfort that might have been caused by B pinnatum (fatigue n = 3, dry throat n = 1, agitation n = 1, difficult digestion n = 1). No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. Conclusion. B pinnatum may be a suitable treatment for sleep problems of cancer patients. Controlled, randomized clinical trials of the use of B pinnatum in sleep disorders are urgently needed.","2015-09","2019-02-14 12:37:40","2019-02-14 12:37:40","","452-459","","5","14","","Integrative Cancer Therapies","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Human; Male; Middle Age; Scales; Fatigue; Aged; Nonexperimental Studies; Sleep Disorders -- Drug Therapy; Cancer Patients; Medicine, Herbal; Plant Extracts -- Administration and Dosage; Plant Extracts -- Adverse Effects; Plant Extracts -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A treatment with sedatives is problematic due to possible adverse effects for mother and embryo/foetus. In the present study, we investigated the sedative effect of Bryophyllum pinnatum, a phytotherapeutic medication used in anthroposophic medicine. In previous clinical studies on its tocolytic effect, B. pinnatum showed a good risk/benefit ratio for mother and child. A recent analysis of the prescribing pattern for B. pinnatum in a network of anthroposophic physicians revealed sleep disorders as one of the most frequent diagnoses for which these preparations are prescribed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women suffering from sleep problems were treated with B. pinnatum (350mg tablets, 50% leaf press juice, Weleda AG, Arlesheim, dosage at physician's consideration). Sleep quality, daily sleepiness and fatigue were assessed with the aid of standardised questionnaires, at the beginning of the treatment and after 2 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. RESULTS: The number of wake-ups, as well as the subjective quality of sleep was significantly improved at the end of the treatment with B. pinnatum. The Epworth Sleeping Scale decreased, indicating a decrease of the tiredness during the day. There was, however, no evidence for prolongation of the sleep duration, reduction in the time to fall asleep, as well as change in the Fatigue Severity Scale after B. pinnatum. No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. CONCLUSION: B. pinnatum is a suitable treatment of sleep problems in pregnancy. The data of this study encourage further clinical investigations on the use of B. pinnatum in sleep disorders.","2014-04-15","2019-02-14 12:38:05","2019-02-14 12:38:05","","753-757","","5","21","","Phytomedicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Middle Age; Scales; Pregnancy Complications -- Drug Therapy; Severity of Illness Indices; Sleep Disorders -- Drug Therapy; Medicine, Herbal; Anthroposophy; Biological Products -- Therapeutic Use; Fatigue -- Drug Therapy; Plants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in 2 experimental groups: C (control) and SR (sleep restriction between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy). Pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear. SR females were subjected to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily. After birth, only male litters (6 for each mother) were selected and designated OC (offspring from C) and OSR (offspring from SR). At 2 months of age, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail plethysmography; at 3 months the renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glomerular area, and number of glomeruli per mm3 were evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Offspring from SR had higher systolic blood pressure than OC. In this group (OSR), we also observed significant increase in RPF and GFR, enlarged glomeruli diameter, and reduced number of glomeruli per mm3 of renal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that sleep restriction during pregnancy is able to modify renal development, resulting in morphologic and functional alterations in young offspring.","2010-10","2019-02-14 12:38:07","2019-02-14 12:38:07","","1357-1362","","10","33","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Body Weight; Analysis of Variance; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Hypertension -- Physiopathology; Body Weights and Measures; Blood Pressure; Sleep Deprivation -- Complications; Animal Studies; Animal Population Groups; Rats; Hypertension -- Etiology; Glucose Tolerance Test -- Methods; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glucose Tolerance Test -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Kidney Diseases -- Etiology; Kidney Diseases -- Physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies are mostly descriptive or focused on specific clinical groups and late pregnancy. We aimed to identify sleep duration trajectories during the pregnancy period, their associated factors, and impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods We studied 200 women from a mother-child cohort recruited in 2009-2011 from the French general population. We used semi-parametric models to analyze data collected through questionnaires. Results We detected three sleep duration trajectories during pregnancy: short-decreasing (<6.5h/night, 10.8% of the sample), medium-decreasing (6.5-8h/night, 57.6%), and long-increasing (>8h/night, 31.6%) trajectories. Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13 [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working > 28 weeks of gestational age (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10-0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e. cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion We identified sleep trajectories among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal and child health.","2017-05","2019-02-14 12:38:10","2019-02-14 12:38:10","","1139-1146","","5","21","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Restless Legs; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Scales; Time Factors; Confidence Intervals; Depression, Postpartum; Regression; Birth Weight; P-Value; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Childbirth, Premature; Insomnia; Secondary Analysis; Cesarean Section; France; Sleep Apnea, Central; Delivery, Obstetric -- Methods; Maximum Likelihood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnant women were recruited in Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort at Zhoushan Maternal and Child Care Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Self-rating depression scales (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scales (SAS) were used for evaluating depression and anxiety status at each trimester; corresponding sleep quality and duration were reported by pregnant women. Ordinary or multilevel linear and logistic regression model were used to estimate the cross-sectional or longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety. The prevalence rates were 35.64, 24.23, and 26.24% for depression and 22.57, 17.41, and 21.04% for anxiety at 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd trimester (T3), respectively. Controlling for potential confounders, it revealed significant cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of sleep with depression and anxiety status. In cross-sectional analysis, women who slept less than 8 h/day had higher risk of depression (T1: OR (95%CI) = 1.75 (1.39, 2.20); T2: 1.52 (1.26, 2.05); T3: 1.60 (1.18, 2.05)) and anxiety (T1: 2.00 (1.57, 2.55); T2: 1.86 (1.37, 2.54); T3: 1.33 (0.99, 1.79)).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We searched several electronic databases for all of the studies published before January 2013 and reviewed references of published articles. Meta-analytic procedures were used to estimate the unadjusted and BMI-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a random effects model. Significant values, weighted effect sizes, and 95% CIs were calculated, and tests of homogeneity of variance were performed. RESULTS Results from nine independent studies with a total of 9,795 pregnant women showed that SDB was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Women with SDB had a more than threefold increased risk of GDM, with a pooled BMI-adjusted OR 3.06 (95% CI 1.89-4.96).

The most common type of SDB, especially among young obese women, is obstructive sleep apnea. SDB has clearly been linked to poor sleep and impaired daytime function, but there are also data linking SDB to other health outcomes, principally cardiovascular and metabolic disease. SDB symptoms are common in pregnancy, and pregnancy itself has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of SDB symptoms. Although a link between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to be biologically plausible, data exploring this relationship are only now emerging, and large prospective studies in which the authors use objective measures of sleep are lacking.

Several new studies have observed that sleep-disordered breathing and short sleep duration also increase the risk of gestational diabetes, similar to observations in the general population. There are varying levels of emerging evidence for potential mechanisms, including oxidative stress, increased sympathetic activity and inflammation, adipokine levels and insulin resistance, linking sleep-disordered breathing events during pregnancy to adverse outcomes.Summary: Sleep-disordered breathing and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes share a number of mechanistic pathways, and growing data in pregnant women indicate that snoring and sleep apnea increase the risk of these and other complications for both the mother and the fetus. Nevertheless, direct evidence of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy exerts negative effects remains sparse.","2010-11","2019-02-14 12:38:16","2019-02-14 12:38:16","","574-582","","6","16","","Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Sleep Disorders -- Diagnosis; Pre-Eclampsia; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Physiopathology; Hypertension -- Risk Factors; Pregnancy Outcomes -- Evaluation; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Diagnosis; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Physiopathology; Anoxia -- Physiopathology; Cytokines -- Analysis; Eclampsia -- Diagnosis; Glucose -- Physiology; Insulin Resistance -- Complications; Lung Diseases; Maternal Mortality -- Evaluation; Medical Practice, Evidence-Based -- Methods; Oxidative Stress -- Physiology; Perinatology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Snoring, the most common symptom of sleep-disordered breathing, is markedly increased during pregnancy. The exact prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women is unknown. Because the apneic episodes are commonly associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturations, the combination of obstructive sleep apnea and pregnancy can be potentially harmful to the fetus given the low oxygen reserves during pregnancy. Obstructive sleep apnea has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension among the general population, and this raises the possibility of its association with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. In this clinical review, we discuss the physiologic changes of pregnancy that predispose pregnant women to the development of obstructive sleep apnea and the effects of sleep-disordered breathing on pregnancy outcomes.

Key risk factors for later-life CVD include gestational hypertension (GHTN) and preeclampsia (PE). Although several risk factors of hypertension in pregnancy are well recognized, a novel risk factor that has emerged recently is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a condition characterized by repeated closure of the upper airway during sleep with disrupted ventilation and sleep fragmentation. In the nonpregnant population, SDB is now known to play a causal role in future CVD.Objective: The aim of this study was to propose the hypothesis that occult SDB during pregnancy may play a role in long-term CVD in women who had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Evidence Acquisition: This study is a review and synthesis of empirical evidence that links SDB to GHTN/PE and GHTN/PE to future CVD.Results: An increasing body of evidence supports the relationship between SDB and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy via mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. It is well established that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with long-term risk for CVD via similar mechanisms. However, no studies have addressed the potential role of SDB in long-term outcomes of women with GHTN/PE during pregnancy.Conclusions: Given the suggested mechanisms that explain these associations, it is plausible that SDB during pregnancy may increase long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Relevance: Pregnancy may offer a window of opportunity for identification and treatment of SDB, which could provide substantial health benefit for many years to come.","2014-03","2019-02-14 12:38:18","2019-02-14 12:38:18","","164-176","","3","69","","Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Human; Risk Factors; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Physiopathology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Complications; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Therapy; Hypertension -- Epidemiology; Pre-Eclampsia -- Physiopathology; Hypertension -- Etiology; Myocardial Ischemia -- Epidemiology; Myocardial Ischemia -- Etiology; Stroke -- Epidemiology; Stroke -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment strategies are similar to the nonpregnant population, however, pregnancy-specific scenarios may arise and these subtleties are addressed in this review.","2011-03","2019-02-14 12:38:20","2019-02-14 12:38:20","","175-189","","1","32","","Clinics in Chest Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Polysomnography; Pregnancy Complications -- Diagnosis; Pregnancy Complications -- Therapy; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Diagnosis; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- Therapy; Risk Factors; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Epidemiology; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Physiopathology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Diagnosis; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Epidemiology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Physiopathology; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Therapy; Pregnancy Complications -- Physiopathology; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Absence of SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of <5, mild SDB as an AHI of 5 to 14.9, and moderate to severe SDB as an AHI of â¥15. The primary outcome was a composite measure of APO: pregnancy-related hypertension, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth â¤34 weeks. We identified 143 women who had undergone a PSG and a delivery. Increasing severity of SDB was associated with an increasing risk of the composite APO: AHI <5, 18.1%; AHI 5 to 14.9, 23.5%; AHI â¥15, 38.5% (p = 0.038). Obese women (body mass index â¥30) with moderate to severe SDB had the highest rate of APO, 41.7%. SDB, especially moderate to severe disease, may be associated with APO.

Data on 3,655 women (mean age = 46.6 years, range 34.3-67.4) were obtained from the Mater Hospital University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy for this cross-sectional study. Self-rated sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For the purpose of this study, two cutoff points (scores 5 and 10) were used to divide women into three categories: normal (65.2 %), moderately poor (26.4 %), and very poor sleep quality (8.5 %). Other covariates were measured at 21-year follow-up as well. After adjusting for reproductive status, mental and physical health, there were significant associations between moderately poor sleep quality and education and between very poor sleep quality and unemployment, both measures of socioeconomic status. In addition, work-related exertion was associated with increased rates of moderately poor sleep quality, whereas those women undertaking moderate exercise were less likely to experience very poor sleep quality. Independent associations between sociodemographic factors and exercise with moderately poor and very poor sleep quality were identified. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the association between exercise/exertion, socioeconomic status, and sleep quality and highlight the importance of taking these into consideration when dealing with issues of poor sleep quality in women.","2012-08","2019-02-14 12:38:24","2019-02-14 12:38:24","","237-247","","4","15","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Adult; Human; Marital Status; Physical Activity; Middle Age; Australia; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Psychological Tests; Self Report; Educational Status; Confidence Intervals; Sleep Disorders; Clinical Assessment Tools; Socioeconomic Factors; Aged; Income; Employment Status; Life Style; Bivariate Statistics; Smoking; Insomnia; Reproductive Health; Alcohol Drinking; Queensland; Self Assessment; Women -- Psychosocial Factors -- Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Obesity is known to predispose to sleep-related breathing disorders. During pregnancy, obese mothers gain additional weight, but other mechanisms may counteract this effect. DESIGN: A case-control study to compare sleep-related breathing in obese pregnant women (mean prepregnancy body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m(2)) with pregnant women of normal weight (mean BMI, 20 to 25 kg/m(2)). SETTING: University teaching hospital with a sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 11 obese women (BMI, 34 kg/m(2); mean age 31 years) and 11 control women (BMI, 23 kg/m(2); mean age 32 years). INTERVENTIONS: Overnight polysomnography was performed during early (after 12 weeks) and late (after 30 weeks) pregnancy. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During pregnancy, obese mothers gained 13 kg and control women gained 16 kg. Sleep characteristics did not differ between the groups. During late pregnancy, the women in both groups slept more poorly and slept in supine position less. During early pregnancy, their apnea-hypopnea indexes (1.7 events per hour vs 0.2 events per hour; p < 0.05), 4% oxygen desaturations (5.3 events per hour vs 0.3 events per hour; p < 0.005), and snoring times (32% vs 1%, p < 0.001) differed significantly. These differences between the groups persisted in the second polysomnography, with snoring time further increasing in the obese. Preeclampsia and mild obstructive sleep apnea were diagnosed in one obese mother. One obese mother delivered a baby showing growth retardation (weight - 3 SD). CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significantly more sleep-related disordered breathing occurring in obese mothers than in subjects of normal weight, despite similar sleeping characteristics.","2001-11","2019-02-14 12:38:25","2019-02-14 12:38:25","","1448-1454","","5","120","","CHEST","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; Human; Polysomnography; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Scales; Time Factors; Clinical Assessment Tools; Finland; Diaries; Academic Medical Centers; Mann-Whitney U Test; Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; Estradiol -- Blood; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- In Pregnancy; Progesterone -- Blood; Oxygen Saturation; Obesity -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Yates' Continuity Correction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm from 7-day logs at 32 to 36 weeks gestation and 4 to 5 weeks postpartum and daily social rhythm from Monk's Social Rhythm Metric. RESULTS: Mothers' total sleep time and activity level decreased after birth. Social rhythms became less regular for mothers and more consistent and regular for fathers. Although sleeping arrangement had no effect on parents' daily social rhythms, it had a significant effect on the 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm. Regularity of sleep-wake rhythms was more prominent for fathers sleeping with mother and baby than for fathers sleeping alone. CONCLUSIONS: Couples having their first child face great changes in their sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms.

We have therefore summarized scientific data on the impact of smoking on respiratory diseases to provide the content for a unique resource, SmokeHaz.Methods: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies (published to 2013) identified from electronic databases, gray literature, and experts. Random effect meta-analyses were used to pool the findings.Results: We included 216 articles. Among adult smokers, we confirmed substantially increased risks of lung cancer (risk ratio (RR), 10.92; 95% CI, 8.28-14.40; 34 studies), COPD (RR, 4.01; 95% CI, 3.18-5.05; 22 studies), and asthma (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.42; eight studies). Exposure to passive smoke significantly increased the risk of lung cancer in adult nonsmokers and increased the risks of asthma, wheeze, lower respiratory infections, and reduced lung function in children. Smoking significantly increased the risk of sleep apnea and asthma exacerbations in adult and pregnant populations, and active and passive smoking increased the risk of tuberculosis.Conclusions: These findings have been translated into easily digestible content and published on the SmokeHaz website.","2016-07","2019-02-14 12:38:27","2019-02-14 12:38:27","","164-179","","1","150","","CHEST","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Risk Factors; Systematic Review; Smoking -- Epidemiology; Meta Analysis; Smoking; Public Health; Respiratory Tract Diseases -- Epidemiology; Respiratory Tract Diseases -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: This study was a cross‐sectional analysis of two cohorts of healthy pregnant women recruited from a prenatal clinic in a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Methods: A total of 322 women reported sociodemographic and health characteristics in a structured interview and wore a wrist actigraph on their nondominant wrist for 7 consecutive days to assess objective sleep patterns. The women's resting blood pressures were measured while seated in the clinic by trained personnel using an electronic sphygmomanometer. Findings: One hundred thirty‐three (41.3%) women reported snoring. Ninety‐three women (28.9%) had <6 hr of nighttime sleep, with only 95 (29.5%) women averaging 7 or more hours of nighttime sleep. In the univariate analyses, snoring was positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as mean arterial pressure levels (p < .05). In the multivariate analyses, snoring remained as a significant predictor of higher diastolic blood pressure (β = 2.07, p < .05) and mean arterial pressure levels (β = 2.00, p < .05), after adjustment for age, parity, gestational age, body mass index before pregnancy, and sleep quantity and quality by actigraphy. Conclusions: Snoring is a highly prevalent condition experienced by healthy third‐trimester pregnant women and is associated with elevated blood pressure. Clinical Relevance: Clinical assessment and screening of snoring are of utmost importance in obstetric nursing practice to potentially prevent or reduce the associated adverse cardiovascular consequences in women during pregnancy.","2018-09","2019-02-14 12:38:30","2019-02-14 12:38:30","","522-529","","5","50","","Journal of Nursing Scholarship","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Cross Sectional Studies; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Taiwan; Gestational Age; Univariate Statistics; Linear Regression; Sleep -- Physiology -- In Pregnancy; Structured Interview; Cardiovascular Risk Factors; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Prevention and Control; Actigraphy -- Utilization; Blood Pressure -- Evaluation; Blood Pressure -- Physiology -- In Pregnancy; Snoring -- Epidemiology -- In Pregnancy; Sphygmomanometers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: A large tertiary medical center. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-forgestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age.

DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional, consecutive case series. SETTING: The Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Umea, Sweden. Participants and measurements: On the day of delivery, 502 women with singleton pregnancies completed a questionnaire about snoring, witnessed sleep apneas, and daytime fatigue. Data concerning medical complications were taken from the women's casebooks. RESULTS: During the last week of pregnancy, 23% of the women reported snoring every night. Only 4% reported snoring before becoming pregnant. Hypertension developed in 14% of snoring women, compared with 6% of nonsnorers (p < 0.01).

The objective of this study was to examine predictors of moderate (1-10 pounds) and high (>10 pounds) postpartum weight retention using data from a prospective pregnancy cohort that followed women into the postpartum period; n = 688 and 550 women at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Analysis included descriptive statistics and predictive modeling using log-binomial techniques. The average weight retained at 3 and 12 months postpartum in this population was 9.4 lb (s.d. = 11.4) and 5.7 lb (s.d. = 13.2), respectively. At 3 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and hours slept during the night were associated with moderate or high weight retention, whereas having an infant hospitalized after going home and scoring in the upper 75th percentile of the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) were associated only with high weight retention. At 12 months postpartum, prepregnancy weight, gestational weight gain, and maternal education were associated with moderate weight retention; and gestational weight gain, maternal age, race, employment status, and having an infant hospitalized at birth were associated with high weight retention. The results of this study illustrate the importance of prepregnancy weight and gestational weight gain in predicting postpartum weight retention. Furthermore, given the lack of successful intervention studies that exist to date to help women lose weight in the postpartum period, the results of this study may help to inform future interventions that focus on such aspects as hours of sleep, dealing with stress associated with a hospitalized infant, and nonclinical eating disorder symptomatology.","2010-10","2019-02-14 12:38:33","2019-02-14 12:38:33","","1996-2003","","10","18","","Obesity (19307381)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Body Weight; Infant, Newborn; Risk Factors; Psychological Tests; Postnatal Period; Sleep Disorders; Socioeconomic Factors; Childbirth; Weight Gain; Hospitalization; Models, Biological; Obesity -- Etiology; Attitude Measures; Eating Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers reviewed the literature regarding the effect of sound on the fetus, newborn, and preterm infant and developed recommendations based on the best evidence. An Expert Review Panel reviewed the data and conclusions. RESULTS: The following recommendations are developed from the review of the literature and are clarified in the body of the article. (1) Women should avoid prolonged exposure to low-frequency sound levels (< 250 Hz) above 65 dB(A) during pregnancy. (2) Earphones or other devices for sound production should not be used directly attached to the pregnant woman's abdomen. (3) The voice of the mother during normal daily activities, along with the sounds produced by her body and those present in her usual surroundings, is sufficient for normal fetal auditory development. The fetus does not require supplemental stimulation. Programs to supplement the fetal auditory experience cannot be recommended. (4) Infant intensive care units should incorporate a system of regular noise assessment. (5) Sound limit recommendations are to maintain a nursery with an hourly Leq of 50 dB(A), an hourly L10 of 55 dB(A) and a 1-second Lmax of 70 dB(A), all A-weighted, slow response scale. (6) Infant intensive care units should develop and maintain a program of noise control and abatement in order to operate within the recommended permissible noise criteria. (7) Care practices must provide ample opportunity for the infant to hear parent voices live in interaction between parent and infant at the bedside. (8) Earphones and other devices attached to the infant's ears for sound transmission should not be used at any time. (9) There is little evidence to support the use of recorded music or speech in the environment of the high-risk infant. Audio recordings should not be used routinely or left unattended in the environment of the high-risk infant. CONCLUSION: The recommendations, if followed, should provide an environment that will protect sleep, support stable vital signs, improve speech intelligibility for the infant, and reduce potential adverse effects on auditory development.","2000-12-02","2019-02-14 12:38:35","2019-02-14 12:38:35","","S88-93","","8","20","","Journal of Perinatology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Sound; Infant Physiology; Noise -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Up to 60 breaths were evaluated for each subject. Sources of intrasubject variability in Φ arising from our methods were explored using mechanical models and by evaluating interobserver agreement.Measurements and Main Results: The mean Φ from infants ranged from 5.8-162.9°, with intrasubject coefficients of variation ranging from 11-123%. On the basis of the mechanical model studies, respiratory inductance plethysmography recording and analysis software added <2.3% to the intrasubject variability in Φ. Potential inconsistencies in breaths selected could have contributed 8.1%, on average, to the total variability. The recording sessions captured 22.8 ± 9.1 minutes of quiet sleep, and enough breaths were counted to adequately characterize the range of Φ in the session.Conclusion: Φ is quite variable during even short recording sessions among preterm infants sleeping quietly. The intrasubject variability described herein arises from the instability of the rib cage and abdominal phase relationship, not from the recording and analytical methods used. Despite the variability, Φ measurements allowed the majority (80%) of infants to be reliably categorized as having relatively synchronous or dyssynchronous breathing. Respiratory inductance plethysmography is easy to use and should prove useful in quantifying respiratory mechanics in multicenter studies of preterm infants.","2014-06","2019-02-14 12:38:37","2019-02-14 12:38:37","","753-760","","5","11","","Annals of the American Thoracic Society","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Human; Infant, Newborn; Male; Gestational Age; Infant, Premature; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Monitoring, Physiologic; Respiration; Plethysmography -- Methods; Tidal Volume -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The women with SCI neither developed pressure areas nor experienced premature deliveries, major complications predicted by literature. Women with SCI have felt that they were victims of inadequate environmental designs that hindered their mobility and inhibited their independence.

Studies reveal that 4-60% of premature infants (born at less than 37 weeks gestation) may experience oxygen desaturation events when in their child safety seats (CSS), potentially resulting in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that premature infants be tested in their CSS prior to hospital discharge. However, neonatal healthcare providers are concerned that this method of testing might not be reliable. No formal studies have investigated the outcomes of repeat testing of premature infants, and little is known about the risk factors for oxygen desaturation events. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive, non-experimental, observational study was to explore the stability of the one-point Infant Car Seat Challenge (ICSC) and risk factors that may be associated with oxygen desaturation events. A sample of 49 premature infants was used to explore the following variables: (1) pass/fail rates following two (ICSC) observation points, (2) oxygen saturation and desaturation patterns, sleep/wake activity, and a measure of head lag (using the pull-to-sit maneuver) during two ICSCs, and (3) the association between head lag, chronological age, time spent sleeping in the CSS and oxygen desaturation events. Data were analyzed by descriptive and nonparametric statistical tests. This study's findings indicated that 86% of premature infants had stable results, 8% passed ICSC 1 but not ICSC 2, and 6% failed ICSC 1 and passed ICSC 2. In addition the odds for oxygen desaturation events increased in infants that are born at a gestational age <=34 weeks, were discharged home at a chronological age of >7 days and had a corrected gestational age of >=37 weeks. Neither head lag or sleep time influenced the ICSC outcomes. Furthermore the ICSC success rate for identifying at risk infants was equal to or better than that of other screening tests for newborn medical conditions. These findings will assist neonatal healthcare providers in making appropriate recommendations for safe travel.","2006-01","2019-02-14 12:38:41","2019-02-14 12:38:41","","","161 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Massachusetts Medical School","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3234192","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Sleep; Descriptive Research; Human; Infant, Newborn; Descriptive Statistics; Gestational Age; Validation Studies; Patient Discharge; Instrument Validation; Nonexperimental Studies; Infant, Premature; Posture; Inpatients; Nonparametric Statistics; Car Safety Devices -- Adverse Effects -- In Infancy and Childhood; Child Passenger Safety; Clinical Assessment Tools -- In Infancy and Childhood; Head; Neck Muscles; Neonatal Assessment; Oxygen Saturation -- In Infancy and Childhood; Sitting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: an exploratory descriptive study. Participants and setting: 235 Jordanian women from the three regions of Jordan, aged between 18 and 54 years, who were pregnant at the time of the study or had previously had at least one full-term pregnancy. Findings: a number of strategies were used by Jordanian women in the sample for the alleviation of heartburn of pregnancy, including non-pharmacological strategies such as diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatments such as antacids, and the use of home remedies such as drinking cold milk, ‘baking powder’ in liquid form or herbs, eating cucumber, lintel seeds, or dry tea leaves. Women aged 40 years and older, who had lower income, and were not employed were more likely to use home remedies to manage heartburn in pregnancy than the other groups. Overall, women rated their chosen strategy as useful. Key conclusions and implications for practice: heartburn can be very uncomfortable and can affect food intake and appetite, daily routine and even sleep. Heartburn during pregnancy is at risk for being poorly managed given that birth is the cure. As a health-care provider, it is important to prepare women and their families to manage heartburn during pregnancy effectively. Midwives should encourage women to seek help from care providers when they need it, and continue to assess heartburn and the strategies used to manage symptoms during pregnancy.","2011-10","2019-02-14 12:38:43","2019-02-14 12:38:43","","603-606","","5","27","","Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Adult; Descriptive Research; Human; Convenience Sample; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Content Analysis; Exploratory Research; Heartburn -- Drug Therapy; Heartburn -- Prevention and Control -- In Pregnancy; Jordan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the impact of stress exposure (pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events), psychological stress responses (perceived stress, subjective experience of stress, anxiety, depression, sleep), and physiological stress responses (salivary cortisol, plasma copeptin levels) on glucose concentrations during pregnancy.Design: Cross-sectional study, including 203 pregnant women at the maternity department of a Swiss university hospital.Methods: All women underwent routine screening for GDM with a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test at 24-30 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events, perceived stress, general psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and amount of sleep were assessed by validated self-report questionnaires. Cortisol was measured using fasting and bedtime saliva samples, and copeptin using fasting plasma. All data were collected before communication of the screening test results.Results: Significant positive associations were found between the number of pregnancy-related major life events and fasting glucose, while there was no association with pregnancy-unrelated major life events. More anxiety and depressive symptoms, a higher general level of distress, and a shorter duration of sleep were related to fasting glucose, although the latter two were no longer significant when age and BMI were controlled for. However, physiological stress responses were not associated with glucose concentrations. When testing for unique associations with fasting glucose, more general distress and shorter duration of sleep independently accounted for higher fasting glucose levels. Finally, when comparing women with and without GDM, we found that women who subsequently received the diagnosis of GDM reported more pregnancy-related life events.Conclusions: Some indicators of stress exposure and psychological stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant women, thus representing important risk factors for GDM development. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Only approximately half of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) report any known risk factors. Women after GDM diagnosis reported more major life events compared to healthy pregnant controls. What does this study add? Stress exposure and psychological stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant before women were aware of their GDM diagnosis. These represent important risk factors for GDM development and potential targets for intervention.","2016-09","2019-02-14 12:38:44","2019-02-14 12:38:44","","712-729","","3","21","","British Journal of Health Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Risk Factors; Scales; Stress, Psychological -- Complications; Glucose Tolerance Test; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Diagnosis; Blood Glucose -- Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Metabolism; Stress, Psychological -- Psychosocial Factors; Switzerland; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Psychosocial Factors; Hydrocortisone -- Metabolism; Peptides -- Blood; Stress, Psychological -- Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants (N = 213) completed a self-administered survey including stress (exogenous variable), depression, sleep (mediators), fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake (endogenous variables). Path analysis was performed to compare mediation effects among pregnant women in each trimester. Consistently across three trimesters, stress was related to depression but not sleep duration, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency or fat intake. Sleep duration was not associated with depression. Depending on trimester, night time sleep disturbance, sleep quality, and sleep latency were related to depression; night time sleep disturbance and depression affected fat intake; stress influenced fruit and vegetable intake. Sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency and depression did not mediate the relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake in the second and third trimesters. However, depression mediated the relationship between stress and fat intake in the first trimester. Stress management interventions may help low-income overweight and obese pregnant women decrease depressive symptoms and therefore contribute to overall nutritional health.","2015-05","2019-02-14 12:38:49","2019-02-14 12:38:49","","1047-1059","","5","19","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Data Analysis Software; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Confidence Intervals; Socioeconomic Factors; Analysis of Variance; Food Habits; Depression -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Path Analysis; Michigan; Stress, Psychological -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Sleep Deprivation -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Obesity -- Risk Factors -- In Pregnancy; Health Food","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care providers assess and treat mental health problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek mental healthcare. For those who seek treatment, the lack of health system integration and existing barriers frequently prevent treatment access. Without treatment, poor prenatal mental health can persist for years and impact future maternal, child, and family well-being.Methods/design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated process of online psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pregnant women compared to usual prenatal care (no formal screening or specialized care). The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. Pregnant women are eligible if they: 1) are <28 weeks gestation; 2) speak/read English; 3) are willing to complete email questionnaires; 4) have no, low, or moderate psychosocial risk on screening at recruitment; and 5) are eligible for CBT. A sample of 816 women will be recruited from large, urban primary care clinics and allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment, and those with mild or moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms then complete six interactive cognitive behavior therapy modules. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Clinic-based providers and researchers conducting chart abstraction and analysis are blinded. Qualitative interviews with 8 to 10 healthcare providers and 15 to 30 intervention group women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results of this trial will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated approach to prenatal mental healthcare and the use of highly accessible computer-based psychosocial assessment and CBT on maternal, infant, and family-based outcomes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01901796.","2014-01","2019-02-14 12:38:51","2019-02-14 12:38:51","","72-72","","1","15","","Trials","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Human; Canada; Pregnancy Complications -- Diagnosis; Pregnancy Complications -- Therapy; Treatment Outcomes; Infant, Newborn; Scales; Time Factors; Cost Benefit Analysis; Pregnancy Complications -- Psychosocial Factors; Internet; Child Development; Study Design; Anxiety -- Diagnosis; Anxiety -- Psychosocial Factors; Depression, Postpartum -- Diagnosis; Depression, Postpartum -- Psychosocial Factors; Apgar Score; Anxiety -- Therapy; Protocols; Stress, Psychological -- Psychosocial Factors; Stress, Psychological -- Diagnosis; Stress, Psychological -- Therapy; Child Welfare -- Economics; Cognitive Therapy -- Economics; Depression, Postpartum -- Therapy; Health Care Costs; Health Care Delivery, Integrated; Maternal Health Services -- Economics; Maternal Welfare -- Economics; Mental Health -- Economics; Mental Health Services -- Economics; Pregnancy Complications -- Economics; Referral and Consultation -- Economics; Therapy, Computer Assisted -- Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parents of these infants should have adequate knowledge and practise the recommended SIDS risk reduction measures. Methods: A survey was conducted between December 2016 and August 2017 at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. Parents of preterm infants ≤36 weeks’ gestation were invited to answer a self‐administered questionnaire to assess their knowledge and practise regarding SIDS risk reduction. Results: Forty‐nine (61.33%) of the 80 parents had heard of SIDS prior to the interview, with social media being the commonest source of information (67.3%). Only 35 (43.7%) correctly answered at least five of nine questions on knowledge of SIDS risk reduction (“good knowledge”). When compared with the group of parents who answered less than five questions correctly (“poor knowledge”), there was no significant difference in the demographic and infant characteristics between the groups. The majority (68.8%) of parents practised bed sharing with their infants, and this was significantly more common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.01). Household smoking was also significantly more common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.048). Conclusion: Knowledge on SIDS risk reduction measures was generally poor among parents of preterm infants in this study. Cigarette smoking, bed sharing and non‐supine sleep positions, which are associated with increased risk of SIDS, were common practise among the present subjects.","2018-08","2019-02-14 12:38:52","2019-02-14 12:38:52","","710-713","","8","60","","Pediatrics International","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Interviews; Sleep; Questionnaires; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Human; Health Knowledge; Parental Attitudes; Surveys; Gestational Age; Social Media; Bed Sharing; Infant, Premature; Smoking; Body Positions; Parent-Infant Relations; Academic Medical Centers -- Malaysia; Malaysia; Risk Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the Healthy People 2010 objectives for maternal and child health to be achieved (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy People 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington DC: US Department of Health and Human Services, 2000), the nature and extent of disparities in maternal behaviors that affect maternal or infant health should be understood. Identifying these disparities can assist public health authorities in developing policies and programs targeting persons at greatest risk for adverse health outcomes.Reporting Period Covered: 2000--2001.Description of System: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of different perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants in 31 states and New York City. This report summarizes data for 2000--2001 from eight states (Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, and North Carolina) on four behaviors (smoking during pregnancy, alcohol use during pregnancy, breastfeeding initiation, and use of the infant back sleep position) for which substantial health disparities have been identified previously.Results: Although the prevalence of each behavior varied by state, consistent patterns were observed among the eight states by age, race, ethnicity, education, and income level. Overall, the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy ranged from 9.0% to 17.4%. Younger (aged <25 years) women, white women, American Indian women, non-Hispanic women (except in Hawaii), women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes consistently reported the highest rates of smoking. Overall, the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy ranged from 3.4% to 9.9%. In seven states, women aged >/=35 years, non-Hispanic women, women with more than a high school education, and women with higher incomes reported the highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy. Overall, the prevalence of breastfeeding initiation ranged from 54.8% to 89.6%. Younger women, black women, women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes reported the lowest rates of breastfeeding initiation. The size of the black-white disparity in breastfeeding varied among states. Overall, use of the back sleep position for infants ranged from 49.7% to 74.8%. Use of the back sleep position was lowest among younger women, black women, women with lower levels of education, and women with low incomes. Ethnic differences in sleep position varied substantially by state.Interpretation: PRAMS data can be used to identify racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in critical maternal health-related behaviors. Although similar general patterns by age, education, and income were observed in at least seven states, certain racial and ethnic disparities varied by state. Prevalence of the four behaviors among each population often varied by state, indicating the potential impact of state-specific policies and programs.Public Health Action: States can use PRAMS data to identify populations at greatest risk for maternal behaviors that have negative consequences for maternal and infant health and to develop policies and plan programs that target populations at high risk. Although prevalence data cannot be used to identify causes or interventions to improve health outcomes, they do indicate the magnitude of disparities and identify populations that should be targeted for intervention. This report indicates a need for wider targeting than is often done. The results from this report can aid state and national agencies in creating more effective public health policies and programs. The data described in this report should serve as a baseline that states can use to measure the impact of policies and programs on eliminating these health disparities.","2004-07-04","2019-02-14 12:38:53","2019-02-14 12:38:53","","1-13","","SS-4","53","","MMWR: Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Smoking -- In Pregnancy; Native Americans; Adult; Human; Age Factors; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Prevalence; Self Report; Educational Status; Confidence Intervals; Surveys; Socioeconomic Factors; Statistical Significance; Breast Feeding; Blacks; Survey Research; Asians; Race Factors; Whites; Hispanics; Epidemiological Research; Healthy People 2010; Health Behavior -- In Pregnancy; Alcohol Abuse -- In Pregnancy; Birth Certificates; Geographic Factors; Risk Taking Behavior -- Epidemiology -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two further studies have confirmed an increased risk of late stillbirth with supine sleep position. As sleep position is modifiable, we surveyed self-reported late pregnancy sleep position, knowledge about sleep position, and views about changing going-to-sleep position.Methods: Participants in this 2014 survey were pregnant women (n = 377) in their third trimester from South Auckland, New Zealand, a multi-ethnic and predominantly low socio-economic population. An ethnically-representative sample was obtained using random sampling. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with non-left sided going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy.Results: Respondents were 28 to 42 weeks' gestation. Reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left side (30%), right side (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%) and other (6%). Two thirds (68%) reported they had received advice about sleep position. Non-left sleepers were asked if they would be able to change to their left side if it was better for their baby; 87% reported they would have little or no difficulty changing. Women who reported a non-left going-to-sleep position were more likely to be of Maori (aOR 2.64 95% CI 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR 2.91 95% CI 1.46-5.78) ethnicity; had a lower body mass index (BMI) (aOR 0.93 95% CI 0.89-0.96); and were less likely to sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR 3.29 95% CI 2.03-5.32).Conclusions: Maternal going-to-sleep position in the last week was side-lying in 91% of participants. The majority had received advice to sleep on their side or avoid supine sleep position. Sleeping on the left-hand side of the bed was associated with going-to-sleep on the left side. Most non-left sleepers reported their sleeping position could be modified to the left side suggesting a public health intervention about sleep position is likely to be feasible in other multi-ethnic communities.","2017-06-17","2019-02-14 12:39:09","2019-02-14 12:39:09","","1-7","","","17","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Logistic Regression; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Self Report; Pregnancy Trimester, Third -- Physiology; Sleep -- Physiology; New Zealand; Pregnancy Complications -- Physiopathology; Perinatal Death -- Epidemiology; Supine Position -- Physiology; Posture -- Physiology; Ethnic Groups -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Pregnancy Complications -- Ethnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A few published personal commentaries have indicated that health professionals' interactions with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality can be emotionally and ethically challenging, highlighting the need for empirical research in this area. This study sought to explore whether working in the fetal medicine setting has an effect on health professionals and to ascertain any supports used to manage these effects. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 40 medical and allied health professionals working in fetal medicine settings in Melbourne, Australia. Qualitative analysis of the interview data was performed using thematic analysis. Results Participants discussed at length the emotional impact of working with patients who were experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes. All participants reported that working in fetal medicine had an impact on their daily lives, and many spoke about dreaming about or losing sleep over patient outcomes. Participants described working in this setting as being particularly difficult when they were pregnant themselves. Most spoke about feeling largely unsupported in their work and felt that these effects resulted in burnout and staff turnover. Conclusions This study explored several work force concerns in fetal medicine. Health professionals working with couples at risk of a fetal abnormality are vulnerable to the phenomena of compassion fatigue and burnout. The need for formal support and self-care management is suggested.

METHODS: This community-based, randomized controlled trial allocated 802 pregnant women (≥16 years, <34 weeks' gestation) to: control, FAB (food, activity, and breastfeeding), sleep, or combination (both interventions) groups. All groups received standard well-child care. FAB participants received additional support (8 contacts) promoting breastfeeding, healthy eating, and physical activity (antenatal-18 months). Sleep participants received 2 sessions (antenatal, 3 weeks) targeting prevention of sleep problems, as well as a sleep treatment program if requested (6-24 months). Combination participants received both interventions (9 contacts). BMI was measured at 24 months by researchers blinded to group allocation, and secondary outcomes (diet, physical activity, sleep) were assessed by using a questionnaire or accelerometry at multiple time points. RESULTS: At 2 years, 686 women remained in the study (86%). No significant intervention effect was observed for BMI at 24 months (P= .086), but there was an overall group effect for the prevalence of obesity (P = .027). Exploratory analyses found a protective effect for obesity among those receiving the ""sleep intervention"" (sleep and combination compared with FAB and control: odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.82]). No effect was observed for the ""FAB intervention"" (FAB and combination compared with sleep and control: odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.81]). CONCLUSIONS: A well-developed food and activity intervention did not seem to affect children's weight status.

In order to understand the development of modern-day rhetoric surrounding childbirth methods and procedures, this article explores the debate over TS between the public and technical sphere in New York City between 1914 and 1916 and examines the ways in which this debate altered obstetric health care for middle- and upper-class White women. The public response to this campaign posed a direct challenge to male obstetricians in New York City, many of whom were ill-equipped, both literally and figuratively, to use this procedure. Using a feminist rhetorical criticism, we examined the pro-TS rhetoric of women writers in New York City, the methods they borrowed from the women’s movement, and the ensuing dialogue between the public and technical spheres. For this study, we analyzed journal and newspaper articles, a pamphlet, a collection of pro-TS organizational documents, letters to the editor, and books published about TS and the history of birth. Lastly, we analyzed theoretical notions of childbirth in women’s health and communication studies. After examining the TS debate, we found that birth practices for middle- and upper-class women in New York City shifted and the obstetric community gained ascendancy over female midwifery. We also found that in certain instances, the rhetoric of pro-TS activists was more technically accurate than the rhetoric of some physicians. Hence the TS debate emerged from an argument over the right to use technical language in the technical and/or the public sphere. Conclusions and implications offered by this historical, feminist analysis question our current understanding of women’s health and birthing practices, doctor–patient communication, and patient empowerment and access to technical knowledge.","2015-11","2019-02-14 12:39:14","2019-02-14 12:39:14","","1076-1088","","11","30","","Health Communication","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Human; Childbirth; Whites; Communication; Empowerment; Feminism; Labor Pain -- Drug Therapy; New York; Newspapers; Obstetric Care -- Trends -- New York; Physician-Patient Relations; Scopolamine -- Therapeutic Use -- In Pregnancy; Social Class","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main outcome was mother's report of her infant's average daily sleep duration at 1 year of age. We ranked urbanicity and population density as quintiles, categorized distance to major roads into 8 categories, and used linear regression adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, smoking during pregnancy, gestational age, fetal growth, and television viewing at 1 year. In this sample, mean (SD) sleep duration at age 1 year was 12.8 (1.6)h/day.

The prevalence of MetS continues to increase in the U.S. and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Little research uses a theoretical model to identify direct or indirect contributions to MetS and predictors to MetS. Identifying the factors that influence MetS in a national sample is necessary to understand targets for intervention to prevent the MetS and its sequelae.Purpose: This study tested a hypothesized conceptual model of the biopsychosocial factors associated with MetS in adults using a representative sample.Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008 data from non-pregnant participants who were 20-80 years old and completed the questionnaire and medical examination with fasting laboratory data. The sample of 2,583 adults represented 212 million non-institutionalized civilian Americans living in the U.S. Path analysis was conducted to test the biopsychosocial model of MetS. Complex samples logistic regression models (CSLR) were utilized to examine the direct and indirect contributions of biomedical (age), biosocial (gender, race, education, income, and marital status), and psychosocial factors (depressive symptoms, diet, physical activity, smoking status, and sleep) to MetS.Results: Of the study population, 29% met the criteria for MetS and 95% had at least one component of MetS. The hypothesized model fit the nationally representative data. The parsimonious model with age, gender, race, education, income, depressive symptoms, physical activity, smoking, and the interaction between age and physical activity explained 25.2% of the variance in the presence of MetS. Mediating effects among the biosocial and psychosocial factors help explain their relationship with MetS.Conclusion: The study supported the hypothesized model and the contributions of biopsychosocial factors to MetS. The study indicated that certain demographic groups were vulnerable to MetS. More studies are needed to examine factors associated with MetS than were from the hypothesized model. Prospective studies are needed to improve psychosocial status and to prevent/reverse MetS.","2011-01","2019-02-14 12:39:18","2019-02-14 12:39:18","","","207 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Maryland, Baltimore","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3454814","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; United States; Male; Middle Age; Aged; Aged, 80 and Over; Metabolic Syndrome X -- Epidemiology -- United States; Models, Psychological -- Evaluation; Psychosocial Aspects of Illness -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infant bed sharing may also increase SUID risk, particularly under certain circumstances. Both of these infant sleeping behaviors are disproportionately higher among Black mothers. We explored the relationship between not using the infant back sleeping and infant bed sharing, developed separate risk factor profiles for these behaviors, and identified maternal characteristics contributing to racial differences in their practice. Merged 2004-2005 birth certificate and Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 2,791 non-Hispanic Black and White Florida women were evaluated using univariable and multivariable analyses to develop risk factor profiles for infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing. Cross-product interaction terms were introduced to identify factors contributing to racial differences. Infrequent back sleeping and frequent bed sharing were reported by two-thirds of Black women and one-third of White women. There was no association between the infant sleeping behaviors when adjusted for race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.31). The infant sleeping behaviors shared no common independent maternal characteristics. Father acknowledgement on the birth certificate was a strong contributor to racial differences in infrequent back sleeping while breastfeeding, trimester of entry to prenatal care, and maternal depression revealed notable racial differences for bed sharing. Behavior-specific and race-specific public health messages may be an important public health strategy for reducing risky infant sleeping behaviors and decreasing SUIDs.","2012-03","2019-02-14 12:39:19","2019-02-14 12:39:19","","713-724","","3","16","","Maternal & Child Health Journal","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Sleep; Questionnaires; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Infant; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Confidence Intervals; Blacks; Bed Sharing; P-Value; Florida; Stratified Random Sample; Whites; Multiple Logistic Regression; Supine Position -- In Infancy and Childhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Circadian rhythms, generated internally and synchronised to the external environment, promote function and support survival in almost every living species. Fetal circadian rhythms can be observed in utero from 30weeks gestation, coupled to the maternal rhythm, but synchronise to the external environment only after birth. Important cues for synchronisation include the light/dark cycle, the timing of feeding, and exposure to melatonin in breast milk. Disruption to these cues may occur during admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. This can impair the development of circadian rhythms, and influence survival and function in the neonatal period, with a potential to impact health and well-being throughout adult life.

RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of obesity continues to increase both in the community and on the labour ward. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery are also on rise. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with hypertensive disease (chronic hypertension and preeclampsia), diabetes mellitus (pregestational and gestational), respiratory disorders (asthma and sleep apnoea), thromboembolic disease, caesarean section and infections (primarily urinary tract infections, wound infections and endometritis). Obesity is a risk factor for anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Obese women are not only at high-risk of airway complications, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, perioperative morbidity and mortality but also pose technical challenges. Obesity also influences the fetal outcomes. Increasing use of regional techniques contributes to the reduced anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Preconception counselling, antenatal screening and anaesthetic assessment are strongly encouraged. SUMMARY: Effective communication and good teamwork between an anaesthetist and an obstetrician are essential for the care of obese parturients. A more liberalized use of regional techniques may be a means of further reducing the anaesthesia-related maternal mortality.","2006-12","2019-02-14 12:39:20","2019-02-14 12:39:20","","631-635","","6","18","","Current Opinion in Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications -- Etiology; Obesity -- Complications; Pregnancy Complications -- Prevention and Control; Prepregnancy Care; Labor; Cesarean Section -- Adverse Effects; Anesthesia, Obstetrical -- Methods; Puerperal Disorders -- Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, and MIRLYN. STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies from 1 969 to 1997 were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and information was organized under the following areas: definition of and the interconnection between circadian rhythm and blood pressure; the circadian variability of blood pressure throughout the trimesters; the patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancies defined as normal and those complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia; and clinical implications. DATA SYNTHESIS: The circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancy is the same as in the non-pregnant state, with a nocturnal decrease, especially during sleep. In patients with chronic hypertension, the nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be steeper. Patients with mild preeclampsia may experience a less pronounced nocturnal decrease in blood pressure. Patients with severe preeclampsia may display a reversed circadian rhythm, with no decrease and/or an increase in nocturnal blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia warrant consideration when monitoring patients and implementing management plans.","2000-09","2019-02-14 12:39:21","2019-02-14 12:39:21","","500-508","","5","29","","JOGNN: Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pre-Eclampsia; Circadian Rhythm -- In Pregnancy; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension; Blood Pressure -- In Pregnancy; Reference Databases, Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aim: To investigate the community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and its effect on the lives of consulting and non-consulting women. Design Of Study: Postal questionnaire survey. Setting: Women aged 18 to 49 (n = 3916) randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register. Method: The questionnaire response rate (adjusted for non-deliveries) was 74% (2304/3106). Chronic pelvic pain was defined as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of at least six months' duration, unrelated to periods, intercourse, or pregnancy. Case subgroups comprised recent consulters, past consulters, and non-consulters. Women who reported dysmenorrhoea alone formed a comparison group. Results: The three-month prevalence of chronic pelvic pain was 24.0% (95% CI = 22.1% to 25.8%). One-third of women reported pain that started more than five years ago. Recent consulters (32% of cases) were most affected by their symptoms in terms of pain severity, use of health care, physical and mental health scores, sleep quality, and pain-related absence from work. Non-consulters (41% of cases) did not differ from women with dysmenorrhoea in terms of symptom-related impairment. Irrespective of consulting behaviour, a high rate of symptom-related anxiety was found in women with chronic pelvic pain (31%) compared with women with dysmenorrhoea (7%). Conclusions: This study showed a high community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Cases varied substantially in the degree to which they were affected by their symptoms. The high symptom-related anxiety in these women emphasises the need for more information about chronic pelvic pain and its possible causes.","2001-07","2019-02-14 12:39:24","2019-02-14 12:39:24","","541-547","","468","51","","British Journal of General Practice","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Sleep Disorders -- Etiology; Middle Age; Prevalence; Health Status; Health Services Accessibility; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety -- Etiology; Pain Measurement; Chronic Disease; Great Britain; Pelvic Pain -- Epidemiology; Dyspareunia -- Complications; Dyspareunia -- Epidemiology; Pelvic Pain -- Complications; Pelvic Pain -- Psychosocial Factors; Sick Leave; Sick Role","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disturbed sleep is independently associated with the inflammatory process and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Safe treatment options to enhance sleep during pregnancy are needed. The primary aim of the study was to test Pender's Health Promotion Model (HPM) by evaluating the contribution of physical activity (PA) to sleep parameters in pregnant women, particularly within the context of prepregnant body mass index (BMI). Twenty-nine sedentary women in the second trimester were enrolled in an 8-week PA intervention pilot study and randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Survey data, including the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), provided descriptive data. Steps per day, as measured by pedometer, and sleep parameters (sleep onset latency [SOL], wake time after sleep onset [WASO], total sleep time [TST], and sleep quality), obtained from sleep diaries, collected for 3 days at the beginning and end of the program, were used to evaluate the daily interaction between PA levels and sleep in pregnancy. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used for analysis, as data were nested within persons. No significant change occurred over the course of the study in either PA levels or sleep parameters. Prepregnant BMI contributed negatively to PA levels (p = 0 0033), PA levels were positively predictive (p = 0.037) of sleep onset latency (SOL) and negatively predictive (p = 0.01) of sleep quality, demonstrating a negative effect of PA on sleep when measured daily. These results contradict findings from other studies that evaluated the PA level-sleep relationship over a week or month. Small sample and selection bias may have contributed to these results. The effect of daily PA level on sleep during pregnancy may have time-of-day, dose, and intensity components that need further study.","2011-01","2019-02-14 12:39:25","2019-02-14 12:39:25","","","227 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Colorado Health Sciences Center","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3467224","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Random Assignment; Randomized Controlled Trials; Diaries; Intervention Trials; Treatment Outcomes -- In Pregnancy; Linear Regression; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Pilot Studies; Physical Activity -- In Pregnancy; Body Mass Index -- In Pregnancy; Colorado; Exercise Physiology -- In Pregnancy; Life Style, Sedentary -- In Pregnancy; Pedometers -- In Pregnancy; Pender Health Promotion Model; Women's Health -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy.

A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions.

Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson chi(2) statistics were used to test for significance.Results: A total of 2,210 women were enrolled: 1,812 in the observational study and 398 in the RCT. Four hundred and eight (18%) women reported current active smoking. Of the nonsmokers, 790 (36%) women reported passive household smoke exposure. Active smoking was associated with more total symptomatic days (P < .001) and nights of sleep disturbance (P < .001). Among the newborns of active smokers, there was a greater risk of small for gestational age < 10th percentile (P < .001), and a lower mean birth weight (P < .001). There were no differences in symptom exacerbation or outcome between nonsmokers with and without passive household cigarette smoke exposure.Conclusions: Among pregnant women with asthma, active but not passive smoking is associated with increased asthma symptoms and fetal growth abnormalities.","2010-03","2019-02-14 12:39:27","2019-02-14 12:39:27","","601-608","","3","137","","CHEST","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Pregnancy Outcomes; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Young Adult; Infant, Newborn; Severity of Illness Indices; Passive Smoking -- Adverse Effects; Smoking; Asthma -- Diagnosis; Disease Progression; Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Asthma -- Drug Therapy; Beclomethasone -- Administration and Dosage; Drug Therapy, Combination; Maternal Exposure -- Adverse Effects; Theophylline -- Administration and Dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous studies in the general population have identified that adoption of healthy lifestyles can prevent DM; however limited research has focused on women with GD. The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of an educational intervention of SUGAR (S?tart U?nderstanding G?estational Diabetes a?nd R?isk of Type 2 Diabetes), on women's perceived risk of developing DM, knowledge of DM, self-efficacy to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors after childbirth among women with GD.A total of 23 women (mean age of 29.7+/-3.9), 18 in SUGAR group and 5 in control group (CG) completed self-reported standardized questionnaires (Risk Perception Survey for Developing Diabetes adapted for women with GD; Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices; Health Promotion Lifestyle Profile II; General Sleep Disturbance Scale; and Demographic Questionnaire) at baseline (third trimester) and post-test (postpartum 6- 8 weeks). Intervention was given post the baseline data collection with a booster session at 2-4 weeks postpartum. The women in CG received attention control treatment.Study participants were obese (BMI M-33.1, SD-7.7) and a majority had a family history of DM. Findings showed that self-efficacy was the single significant predictor and accounted for 22% of the variance of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Participants had a clinical significant sleep disturbance during both pregnancy and postpartum. At baseline, poor sleepers reported a lower self-efficacy. The intervention significantly increased DM knowledge for women in the SUGAR group; however, not for perceived risk, self-efficacy nor healthy lifestyle behaviors. There was no difference between groups for postpartum glucose screening rates with only 39% receiving recommended testing.Future research needs to focus on prevention programs and center on self-efficacy, postpartum glucose screening, improve sleep, and adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. To ensure a better preventive care for GD women, education provided for both patients and health care provider is needed.","2013-01","2019-02-14 12:39:29","2019-02-14 12:39:29","","","199 p","","","","","","","","","","Georgia State University","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3569153","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Scales; Self Report; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Epidemiology; Pilot Studies; Diabetes Education -- Evaluation -- In Pregnancy; Self-Efficacy -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence suggests that continuous bright light levels in particular, may have negative effects on growth and development. However, little data exists to suggest how much and when light stimulation is appropriate. This study utilized a longitudinal randomized experimental design to examine the timing and effects of cycled light and continuous near darkness throughout hospitalization on the health and development of preterm infants <31 weeks gestation. Sixty two infants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: near darkness from birth to 32 weeks gestation followed by cycled light until discharge, cycled light throughout hospitalization, or near darkness throughout the hospitalization with cycled light at 36 weeks gestation in preparation for discharge.This study failed to reveal any significant benefits of near darkness over cycled light from birth for weight gain, length of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, neurobehavioral development, and sleep-wake states outcomes. The weight gain of the group of infants that received cycled light from birth was greater, though not significantly so, than the weight gain for infants receiving near darkness until 36 weeks gestation. Infants receiving near darkness until 36 weeks gestation developed more severe ROP throughout hospitalization and more elevated heart rates than the infants receiving cycled light from birth. In addition, infants receiving near darkness at birth followed by cycled light at 32 weeks gestation had significantly more failures on the BAER than infants receiving near darkness followed by cycled light at 36 weeks gestation. Yet, there were no differences in the number of BAER failures between the infants receiving cycled light from birth and the infants receiving near darkness followed by cycled light at 36 weeks.The findings of this study consistently supported the idea that continuous near darkness for hospitalized preterm infants has no significant advantages over cycled light. Future research should continue the direction begun by this study to ascertain the most appropriate time to begin cycled light in the neonatal environment and optimal level of illumination during day lighting.","2000-01","2019-02-14 12:39:30","2019-02-14 12:39:30","","","261 p","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI9968552","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Prospective Studies; Human; Infant, Newborn; Time Factors; Clinical Trials; Infant, Premature; Infant Development; Light; Growth -- In Infancy and Childhood; Infant Stimulation -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also investigated the effect on the heart rate (HR) and determined the proportion of time spent in target.Methods: This was an exploratory study. Women with chronic hypertension taking either labetalol or nifedipine were offered 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Sleep, wake and drug ingestion times were self-reported. An indirect response model was used to analyse the systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and HR time-series; the effect of gestation and type of drug was evaluated.Results: Forty-eight women were recruited: 24 in each group. There was no difference in clinical characteristics. In women taking nifedipine there was a positive association between the dose of nifedipine and pre-dose BP p = .002, this was not present in the labetalol group. There was a difference between the drug effects on both the SBP and DBP time-series (p = .014). In comparison to labetalol, there was less variation in day time BP in those women prescribed nifedipine. Women on labetalol spent a larger proportion of time with their DBP below target (<80 mmHg). The HR dynamics were qualitatively different, a stimulatory effect was found with nifedipine compared to an inhibitory effect with labetalol.Conclusion: There are significant and important differences between the BP lowering effects of nifedipine and labetalol.

Methods Infants were exposed to lullaby music (6 minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6 minutes recorded lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12 minutes (baseline and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent overall.

STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with uncomplicated full-term pregnancies and their offspring were prospectively recruited from a community and hospital low-risk obstetric surveillance. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire on second trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (WatchPAT; Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea hypopnea index >5) and controls. Infant GMs were assessed in the first 48 hours and at 8-11 and 14-16 weeks of age. At 12 months of age the Infant Developmental Inventory and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire were administered. RESULTS: In all, 74 women and their full-term infants were studied. Eighteen (24%) women had SDB. Mean birthweight was 3347.1 ± 423.9 g. Median Apgar score at 5 minutes was 10 (range, 8-10). In adjusted comparisons, no differences were found between infants born to mothers with SDB and controls in GM scores in all 3 evaluations. Low social developmental score was detected at 12 months in 64% of infants born to SDB mothers compared to 25% of infants born to controls (adjusted P = .036; odds ratio, 16.7). Infant snoring was reported by 41.7% of mothers with SDB compared to 7.5% of controls (P = .004).

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Sitting Pelvic Tilt Exercise on physical disability in primigravidas with low back pain during the third trimester. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was carried out on 60 primigravidas who attended in 3 prenatal clinics of Zanjan University of medical science. At first, 60 primigravidas were selected by simple sampling and randomly divided into two groups: case and control. Only the experimental group did the sitting pelvic tilt exercise program for 8 weeks during the third trimester. Data was collected for both groups by interview using VAS scale and Disability Rating Index (DRI) on the days 0 and 56 (pre and post intervention). Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, occupation, education and BMI and intensity of physical disability before the intervention. However, intensity of physical disability significantly decreased (p<0.0001) in the experimental group after the exercise program. Adversely, the intensity of physical disability increased in the control group as pregnancy proceed (p<0.0001). Intensity of low back pain was also reduced in the experimental group after the sitting pelvic tilt exercise program comparing to pre treatment stage and also in comparison with the control group (P<0.0001). Conclusion: It seems that use of exercise programs such as 'sitting pelvic tilt exercise' is an effective method in pregnant women who suffer from low back pain and related disabilities but do not want to use aggressive treatments and chemical pain relief drugs.","2010","2019-02-14 12:39:38","2019-02-14 12:39:38","","13-22","","69","17","","Journal of Zanjan University of Medical Sciences & Health Services","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Low Back Pain -- Therapy -- In Pregnancy; Low Back Pain -- Prevention and Control -- In Pregnancy; Pelvic Tilt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) refers to impairment in insulin secretion and differing degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. 15 Terms for DM classification have changed due to overlap in the age groups and respective treatments. 12 Outdated terms such as juvenile or adult onset diabetes have been replaced with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM.12 The international committee has determined that a Hemoglobin A1C (HGA1C) of 6.5% or above should be used for the diagnosis of diabetes. 14 There are two main types of DM; Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (TIDM) and T2DM. 15 Symptomatic hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are typical of T1DM however, T2DM may not present with outright hyperglycemia. 15 Many times T2DM is detected during routine testing. 15 This review will use the HGA1C assay to determine glycemic control. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The estimated worldwide incidence of individuals with diabetes was approximately 366 million in 2011 and is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030. 1 The growing epidemic of T2DM has prompted global concern 1,2 with a call for awareness, prevention and improved management of the disease. Experts speculate that the increased incidence in T2DM is a product of globalization, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. 1 The estimated worldwide incidence of diabetes was approximately 366 million in 2011 and is expected to rise to 552 million by 2030. 1 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus can lead to illness and a taxing financial burden, with T2DM contributing to over 20% of all deaths after the age of 49 for all regions of the world during 2011. 1 Worldwide estimates of health expenditures in 2010 accounted for $376 billion in T2DM related illnesses. 1 Projected costs by 2030 are expected to reach $490 billion without a concerted effort to control this disease. 1 In 2010, 1.9 million new cases of T2DM were diagnosed in the United States 12 and currently there are 25.8 million adults and children with all types of diabetes with at least 7.0 million people not yet diagnosed. 12 The growing epidemic of T2DM is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among people between the ages of 20 and 74 years of age. 12 People living with T2DM suffer from multiple complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and neuropathies associated with the disease. 12 The total cost of T2DM in the U.S. for the year 2007 was $174 billion 12 and costs continue to rise in spite of educational programs. Worldwide efforts to reduce the financial and physiological burden of T2DM 1,2,12,13 exist, but have been unsuccessful. Researchers have been working diligently toward an efficient and economical alternative to the current status quo when it comes to traditional anti-diabetic treatment. Latest guideline changes to diagnosing and monitoring diabetes were announced during the 69th American Diabetic Association's (ADA) annual Scientific Session in 2009. 14 During this session, the ADA, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and European Association fo Overweight, Obesity, and Body Mass Index The substantial impact of obesity on subsequent metabolic disorders is a complex situation that requires further investigation. Obesity, now considered a chronic disease, is linked to hypertension, T2DM, insulin resistance, joint issues, and obstructive sleep apnea. 16 An energy imbalance is the best way to describe obesity; it means that the energy consumption out weights the energy expenditure 17 Overweight and obesity are defined as “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health”. 2 BMI is determined by a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters. 1The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight as a body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 25 (kilograms per meters squared) kg/m2 and obesity as greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2. In 1980, over 1.5 million adults across the globe were considered overweight and the numbers have doubled. 2 Approximately 2.8 million deaths, 13 44% of diabetes, and 23% of heart disease cases are attributed to overweight and obesity across the globe.13 Disparities across all countries reflect that women with less education were two to three times more likely to be obese or overweight versus women with higher education. 18 Approximately 25% of the population in England are obese as well as 18% in Hungary and 15% in Spain and Ireland. 18 Adult Americans with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or greater are estimated at about 149.3 million. 16 The worldwide financial burden accounts for approximately 0.7% - 2.8% of total health-care costs 16 and American health-care costs related to obesity estimated to reach $861-957 billion by 2030. 13 By lowering BMI by 5 %, millions of dollars in healthcare costs could be saved. 18 Vitamin D Vitamin D, discovered in the 1700s, was not only used to cure rickets and improve osteomalacia 19 but since then has been associated with a reduction in cancer risk, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders, T1DM, and T2DM. 20 Investigators have also found increased levels of Vitamin D3 to be associated with reduced mortality rates of all causes. 20 In 1940, a physician researcher investigating skin cancer and sunlight discovered an inverse relationship between increased sunlight exposure and decreased incidence of all types of cancers except skin cancer. 21 That introduction into the biological effects of sunlight on cancer mortality rates, spurred interest in Vitamin D. The impetus for further investigation of Vitamin D began to evolve in 1970, when Holick 8 isolated 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 into the active form 1,25-dihydroxivitamin D3. 22 His seminal work 22 in this field revealed that many tissues and cells in the body have Vitamin D receptors (VDR) and thus have the ability of converting circulating Vitamin D or 25-hydroxyvitamin (D 25(OH)D3) to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3). 8 There are two forms of Vitamin D; 19 they are Vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Plants synthesize ergocalciferol and the skin, when exposed to ultraviolet sunlight, synthesizes cholecalciferol. 19 Vitamin D3 deficiency is linked to a lack of ultraviolet B rays from the sun, use of sun block, increased skin pigmentation, seasonal variation, location of the sun, latitude, aging, and obesity. 23 Metabolism of Vitamin D involves conversion in the liver and the kidneys. Sufferers of chronic diseases such as diabetes, pancreatitis, celiac disease, and diseases taxing the liver and kidneys are at greater risk of Vitamin D deficiency. 19 Vitamin D status is classified as: 25(OH)D deficiency < 20 ng/ml, insufficiency 21-29ng/ml; and a normal level at 30ng/ml. 8 The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults aged 18-70 is 600IU/day and for those over 70, the RDA is 800IU/day. 24 The RDA upper limit for Vitamin D supplementation in adults over 18 years of age is 4000IU/day. 24 The best predictor of Vitamin D status is determined by measuring 25(OH)D3 in the blood. The circulating form of Vitamin D, 25(OH)D3, in the blood exists for approximately 2-3 weeks, thus providing a more accurate serum Vitamin D level than the active form 1,25-(OH)2D3 8 which is only available for measurement for about 2-4 hours. 8 Obesity, Vitamin D, and Type 2 diabetes Mellitus It is believed that Vitamin D may assist in improving glycemic control by improving insulin production and secretion. 20 It is hypothesized that vitamin D may inhibit pancreatic beta cell dysfunction by protecting islet cells from destruction. 7 Preliminary research has found an inverse relationship between Vitamin D status and obesity. 5 Vitamin D deficiency in the obese population offers an intriguing perspective. Vitamin D is fat-soluble, behaves like a hormone, and is sequestered in adipose tissue. 23, 25 It has been hypothesized that the greater the fat mass the greater the Vitamin D deficiency. 5 Obesity, a disease associated in the pathophysiology of T2DM, is a consequence of over nutrition and sedentary life-style in those with a genetic predisposition. 26 Demise of the islet beta cell is said to be caused by over nutrition and inactivity. 27 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and pancreatic beta cell dysregulation. 4 Commonalities between T2DM and obesity involve systemic vascular inflammation. 28 Over nutrition promotes adipose tissue inflammation and beta cell stress; these cellular responses cause insulin signaling impairment and possible subsequent development of T2DM. 17, 28 Cellular responses in organs stemming from inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. 28 Other contributing factors to this inflammation 28 involve changes in environment, lifestyle, sleep deprivation, and diets low in fiber. Systemic vascular inflammation increases with age and is more pronounced and prolonged in those at risk for T2DM. 28 Vitamin D activity in the beta cells is potentiated by the activation of Vitamin D receptors (VDR) located in the pancreas, this in turn allows for a reduction in systemic inflammation. 29 The global increase in obesity and the possible relationship to VDD may present a unique opportunity to impact T2DM at the onset. 5 Current medications such as Byetta and Victoza, which affect both glycemic control and obesity, may present obstacles to treatment such as unfavorable side effects like nausea, emesis, headache, diarrhea 30,31 and a potential risk for pancreatitis, 30 renal insufficiency, 30 and/or thyroid tumor. 31 In a commentary on the link between Vitamin D deficiency and T2DM, the reviewer reports that Vitamin D depletion may have dose related effects on glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and insulin resistance. 32 Vitamin D supplemented at the higher dose limit 23 may be a less expensive and effective treatment to harness obesity in the T2DM adult. A preliminary search of the Joanna Briggs Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Pub Med, and PROSPERO has revealed a number of reviews covering the link between VDD and various disease processes which include T2DM and obesity. Mitri et al. 6 conducted a meta-analysis that included different levels of evidence correlating high levels of Vitamin D with a 43% lower risk of developing T2DM. In 2010, Renzaho et al. 9 conducted a review focusing on VDD and its relation to obesity, T2DM, and/or cardiovascular disease in which they 9 reported that ethnic minorities from various countries had significant VDD. The results also showed an inverse relation between Vitamin D status and obesity; however, the strength of the studies was limited due to the various tools used for determining body fat and not necessarily BMI. 9 A recent review 3 included a mix of multi-level resear fasting glucose. A review conducted by Alvarez et al. 10 also found an inverse relationship between Vitamin D and T2DM; however, dose-dependent glycemic control was not detailed. Another review 11 on the relationship between VDD, obesity, and T2DM found that women who received Vitamin D and Calcium supplementation had less weight gain and smaller waist circumference at a 7 year follow-up versus the placebo group. The results from this were difficult to isolate due to the inclusion of Calcium-Vitamin D supplementation combinations. 11 As there have been several systematic reviews to gain understanding of the relationship between Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, this systematic review will narrow its focus to investigate the effect of Vitamin D in the non-pregnant, obese, VDD adult with T2DM. This review aims to determine what effect vitamin D supplementation has on glycemic control and obesity in the T2DM adult by measurements of HGA1C and BMI, respectively.","2013-02","2019-02-14 12:39:39","2019-02-14 12:39:39","","343-356","","2","11","","JBI Database of Systematic Reviews & Implementation Reports","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Body Mass Index; Adult; Human; Obesity; CINAHL Database; Medline; Systematic Review; Embase; Glycemic Control; Vitamin D Deficiency; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 -- In Adulthood; Dietary Supplementation; Vitamin D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Very often different brands of over-the-counter vitamins and minerals are taken, without considering the possibility of exceeding the maximum daily allowance, particularly where it concerns fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A. Although many people are aware of the consequences of taking too little vitamin A, this fat-soluble vitamin is stored in the body and over-dosage may occur when taking high doses. In this paper we investigate the effects of hypo- and hypervitaminosis A on craniofacial structures, lungs, hearts, limbs and the kidneys as well as the involvement in foetal nervous system development and post-natal sensorimotor functioning. Furthermore, we discuss how hypo- and hypervitaminosis A may affect the midline and lateral parts of the cerebellum, vermis, flocculi, ganglionic cell layer as well as the suprachiasmatic nucleas of the brain. Changes in the functioning of these areas due to hypo- and hypervitaminosis A, may lead to developmental and learning disabilities involving all forms of motor learning, vestibular functioning, eye and visual system deficits, disrupted sleep rhythms as well as altered mood and emotional processes.","2006-01","2019-02-14 12:39:40","2019-02-14 12:39:40","","47-64","","102","52 part 1","","British Journal of Developmental Disabilities","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Child; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Prenatal Care; Pregnancy Complications -- Etiology; Child, Preschool; Brain -- Physiopathology; Emotions; Arousal; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced -- In Pregnancy; Avitaminosis -- Etiology -- In Pregnancy; Avitaminosis -- Familial and Genetic; Child Development Disorders -- Complications; Hearing Disorders -- Complications -- In Infancy and Childhood; Hypervitaminosis A -- Complications -- In Utero; Kidney Diseases -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Learning Disorders -- Complications -- In Infancy and Childhood; Lung Diseases -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Metabolic Diseases -- Etiology -- In Pregnancy; Motor Skills Disorders -- Complications -- In Infancy and Childhood; Nervous System Diseases -- Complications -- In Pregnancy; Nutritional Requirements; Retinoids -- Therapeutic Use; Vision Disorders -- Complications -- In Infancy and Childhood; Vitamin A Deficiency -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Animal models suggest that this may be mediated via the HPA axis. Interventions to reduce stress in pregnant women are now a priority. Large prospective studies are providing increasing independent evidence that maternal stress/anxiety during pregnancy can affect fetal brain development, having adverse effects on the child's emotional, behavioural and cognitive development. It is suggested that the function of fetal programming is linked with a predictive adaptive response. Environmental influences on the mother are preparing the child in her womb for the external environment it is likely to inhabit. This is different from the genetic changes and mutations which will be effective for many generations. These affect circadian rhythm including sleep habit, and other aspects including laterality and sexuality. Their seriousness is now well enough established to feature in an American Child Health strategic plan 2005-10. Animal studies have provided a basis for human studies.. Antenatal maternal stress in rats leads to anxiety in the offspring. It can alter laterality -- right-handedness etc -- and sexuality, and disrupt the circadian rhythm including sleep pattern. Prenatal stress reduces the animal's later negative feedback, the calming effect of cortisol, by reducing the cortisol receptors in the hippocampus. In monkeys likewise, maternal prenatal stress leaves the offspring with a lower attention span and more anxiety. There are greater cortisol responses, and imaging also reveals more dopamine receptors to be affected by that stress neurotransmitter. So there is objective evidence of mammalian prenatal stress effects on offspring. In a group of anxious mothers, a simple arithmetic exercise met with a rise in fetal heart-beat, showing that maternal stress clearly affects the fetus. Dr Glover's human research has made use of the ALSPAC community study program. The strongest effects discerned of maternal prenatal stress on the offspring were on behavioural and emotional problems.. The strength of effect was stronger from stress at 32 weeks prenatally than 18 weeks, and resulted in double the levels of the offspring's hyperactivity, and emotional and conduct disorders. The children of anxious mothers in late pregnancy had high waking level of cortisol. In a separate study her group has shown that prenatal stress can affect the child's cognitive development also. In this study it was stress due to relationship problems with the partner, particularly emotional cruelty and separation, which had the largest effect on the child. Studies show that stress acts on the hypothalamus to produce corticotrophin releasing hormone, which in turn acts on the pituitary gland to produce adreno-corticotrophic hormone. This stimulates the adrenal gland to secrete cortisol for negative feedback to the hippocampus to stabilise the system. Yet both maternal and fetal cortisol are a positive stimulus on placental CRH. These results suggest the importance of detecting and treating affective disorder and relationship stress during pregnancy, both for the direct benefit to the mother herself, and particularly to help reduce later development of behavioural and other problems in children.","2007-11","2019-02-14 12:39:41","2019-02-14 12:39:41","","61-62","","1/2","19","","Nutrition & Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Child Development; Fetal Development; Cognition; Behavior and Behavior Mechanisms; Brain -- Embryology; Hydrocortisone; Stress -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purposive sample consisted of matched sets of mothers and fathers in ten families who were mother and father living together in a committed relationship, whether married or not; over the age of 18 years; and who were English speaking; parent of infant born between 32 and 37 weeks gestation who was hospitalized between one and three weeks, having no obvious birth defects; at discharge requiring no more than 1-2 medications, and no supplemental oxygen.This was an exploratory study using methods of naturalistic inquiry described by Lincoln and Guba (1985). The ongoing process of Finding the Rhythm in Our New Family emerged from data analysis. This process permeated the experience beginning with the disruption brought on by the early birth. In the three to five weeks following the discharge of the premature infant from the NICU, the process continued with mothers and fathers identifying patterns in their family, constructing routines and beginning reconnection with family, friends and the outside world. The eight themes contributing to the process are: Feeling the disruption; Riding the emotional roller coaster, Seeing myself as parent; feeling the part; Figuring out the (premature) baby; Surviving on combat sleep; Evolving as a parenting couple; I left the NICU, has the NICU left me?; Reconnecting with life within and outside the family. The mothers and fathers in this study experienced the process in different ways and were at different places in relation to their identification of the rhythms of their new family. The findings reveal what parents experience in living at home with premature infants generally considered 'healthy' by clinicians. The findings related to process and themes are foundational for future research. Future studies could have as primary focus: parents' experience of GE reflux; the apnea monitor at home; surviving on combat sleep or more in-depth study of the experience of fathers.","2010-01","2019-02-14 12:39:49","2019-02-14 12:39:49","","","242 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3416642","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Human; Fathers; Life Experiences; Mothers; Infant, Premature; Exploratory Research; Home Environment; Naturalistic Inquiry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Targeting interventions towards subgroups of individuals who are predisposed, but yet normal weight, may prove more effective in preventing overweight than interventions towards unselected normal weight subsets. Finally, interventions focused on other factors than diet and activity are lacking. The objectives were to perform a randomized, controlled intervention aiming at preventing overweight in children aged 2-6 years, who are yet normal weight, but have high predisposition for future overweight, and to intervene not only by improving diet and physical activity, but also reduce stress and improve sleep quality and quantity.Methods/design: Based on information from the Danish National Birth Registry and administrative birth forms, children were selected based on having either a high birth weight, a mother who was overweight prior to pregnancy, or a familial low socioeconomic status. Selected children (n = 5,902) were randomized into three groups; an intervention group, a shadow control group followed in registers exclusively, and a control group examined at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Approximately 21% agreed to participate. Children who presented as overweight prior to the intervention were excluded from this study (n = 92). In the intervention group, 271 children were included, and in the control group 272 were included. Information obtained from the shadow control group is on-going, but it is estimated that 394 children will be included. The intervention took place over on average 1½ year between 2009 and 2011, and consisted of optional individual guidance in optimizing diet and physical activity habits, reducing chronic stress and stressful events and improving sleep quality and quantity. The intervention also included participation in cooking classes and play arrangements. Information on dietary intake, meal habits, physical activity, sleep habits, and overall stress level was obtained by 4-7 day questionnaire diaries and objective measurements.Discussion: If the Healthy Start project is effective in preventing excessive weight gain, it will provide valuable information on new determinants of obesity which should be considered in future interventions, and on new strategies to prevent development of overweight and obesity at an early age.","2012-01","2019-02-14 12:39:50","2019-02-14 12:39:50","","590-590","","1","12","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Child; Human; Diet; Male; Risk Factors; Obesity -- Epidemiology; Randomized Controlled Trials; Child, Preschool; Risk Assessment; Obesity -- Prevention and Control; Denmark; Stress, Psychological -- Prevention and Control; Motor Activity; Health Promotion -- Methods; Forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patient's perceptions of stressors and supports during hospitalization were assessed. A convenience sample of 30 multigravida women were used for the study sample. Patients hospitalized a minimum of four days or more participated in a semi-structured interview to assess their perceptions. A modified Sarason Life Experience Survey (LES) and a Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS), was administered following the interviews. Quantitative methods for analysis of the demographic, LES, and JCS data were done using descriptive statistics. Qualitative analysis of the audiotaped interviews were performed using the naturalistic paradigm. These hospitalized women reported people, events and issues as stressors. Critical areas identified were: environmental confinement, difficulty in interpersonal communications, loss of control, isolation and loss of the parental role. The primary means of support reported by these hospitalized women were people. Interactions and relationships that these women had with their immediate family and friends provided this support. Care given by the nurses and doctors in stabilizing the patient's medical condition and maintaining the pregnancy was critical. A greater number of negative life events than positive were identified in these women. Negative life events with the greatest impact were: change in sleep habits, recreation, other events, and social activities. Coping styles utilized and found most effective were Supportant, Optimistic, and Confrontive. Coping styles used less and found least effective were Fatalistic, Evasive, and Emotive. The relationships between stressful life events and coping styles used during hospitalization demonstrated that not all subjects utilized multiple support systems along with problem solving behaviors to cope with the stress of hospitalization. Younger women reported more stressful life events and used different coping styles than the older women.

There was no difference between respondents and nonrespondents in terms of age, gender and year of graduation. Results: The majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge and skills in counselling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms used to identify 'depression' were sleep disorders and only 54% listed depressed mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for DSM-IV major depressive disorder, which supports views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. Fifty-seven percent of doctors used medicine together with nonpharmacological treatment in the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range recommended in the product information. Conclusions: There is a need to improve GPs knowledge in diagnosing depression, in child psychiatry and in dealing with pregnant and suicidal patients.","2001-12","2019-02-14 12:39:53","2019-02-14 12:39:53","","827-827","","6","35","","Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Male; Middle Age; Depression -- Diagnosis; Depression -- Therapy; Physicians, Family","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The importance of psychological well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes. METHODS: 165 antenatal women were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14 days and 6 months postnatal. RESULTS: No significant differences between groups were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible, however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can affect psychological status.","2008-06","2019-02-14 12:39:54","2019-02-14 12:39:54","","391-398","","3","14","","Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Scales; Pregnancy -- Psychosocial Factors; England; Decision Making; Maternal-Child Nursing -- Administration; Midwifery; Outcome Assessment; Postnatal Care -- Psychosocial Factors; Self-Esteem Inventory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a heightened risk for this attribution when an infant is born preterm. GER/GERD has been associated with maternal anxiety and depression that may negatively affect the maternal-infant relationship.The study was a secondary data analysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of maternal perception that her infant has symptoms of GER/GERD on maternal-infant interaction. The study also explored the influence of GER/GERD on maternal anxiety. A non-experimental comparative design was utilized with a convenience sample of 64 mothers and their healthy growing premature infants who were recruited at 32 weeks gestation. Review of home visit records as well as personal interviews revealed three attribution groupings: mother with no concerns and infant had no symptoms, mother attributed infant symptoms to GER/GERD but she was not concerned, and mother attributed infant symptoms to GER/GERD, was concerned, and sought medical attention. Child and maternal contingency scores were obtained with the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) when infants were 6 months of age. Anxiety was measured with the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI).MANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference in the mother-infant interaction among the 3 attribution groups, even when taking into account maternal anxiety and depression scores. There was not a statistically significant difference in maternal anxiety between groups.Results suggest that having an infant with behaviors attributed to GER/GERD does not negatively affect the mother infant relationship at 6 months. A limitation of this study was the small sample size and the lack of conformity of the three attribution groups in terms of demographic factors, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, that have been shown in other research to influence the mother-infant interaction.","2007-01","2019-02-14 12:39:55","2019-02-14 12:39:55","","","110 p","","","","","","","","","","University of Colorado Health Sciences Center","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3264556","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Interviews; Human; Depression; Convenience Sample; Comparative Studies; Psychological Tests; Scales; Anxiety; Demography; Socioeconomic Factors; Mother-Infant Relations; Infant, Premature; Race Factors; Multivariate Analysis of Variance; Gastroesophageal Reflux -- Psychosocial Factors; Perception; Gastroesophageal Reflux -- Symptoms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The content will provide clinically useful information to midwives and health care professionals involved in caring for women during the antenatal, intranatal and postnatal periods. The impact of psychological health status in pregnancy on clinical outcomes such as preterm labour, pre-eclampsia, epidural use, caesarean section, instrumental deliveries and increased rates of admission to neonatal intensive care, alongside the cognitive and social development of the infant and child are well documented. Less research to date has considered the impact of psychological well-being on the mother throughout pregnancy, the peripartum, postpartum and beyond. Psychological status for these women has traditionally been characterised by anxiety and depression, largely ignoring the complex psychological interrelations that characterise pregnancy. Psychological status in pregnancy cannot be defined within a unidimensional framework but must include a comprehensive assessment of all the dimensions that attribute to mood and emotional status for women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. This paper intends to address the constructs of anxiety and depression, worry, control, quality of life, sleep and self-esteem. Screening for, and identification of, maternal psychological distress from a multidimensional perspective enables healthcare professionals to recognise and acknowledge normal and abnormal adjustment and offer interventions, strategies and support to facilitate a woman's transition to motherhood.","2004-09","2019-02-14 12:39:56","2019-02-14 12:39:56","","143-155","","3-4","8","","Clinical Effectiveness in Nursing","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Postnatal Period; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Childbirth; Quality of Life -- In Pregnancy; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Self Concept -- In Pregnancy; Research; Anxiety -- In Pregnancy; Sleep -- In Pregnancy; Professional Practice, Evidence-Based; Depression, Postpartum -- Risk Factors; Control (Psychology) -- In Pregnancy; Psychological Well-Being -- Evaluation -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to determine the incidence of PPD and the associated risk factors in a group of new mothers undergoing routine follow-up at an urban maternity clinic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study investigating the relationship between PPD and various factors. A total of 187 women that presented to a university hospital for routine postpartum follow-up 4-6 weeks post delivery were recruited consecutively. The mothers were administered a sociodemographic form that included questions about the known risk factors (sociodemographic and sociocultural factors, and mother-related, pregnancy-related, and child-related factors) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: The incidence of PPD based on EPDS scores was 28.9% (scores > 12 were defined as PPD). Unplanned/unintended pregnancy, bottle-feeding only, mother's lack of satisfaction with the baby's sleep pattern, lack of family support for baby care, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were significantly correlated with PPD (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression showed that bottle-feeding, lack of family support, lack of satisfaction with the marital relationship, and family violence were the primary factors that significantly increased the risk of PPD. Conclusions: The findings show that the PPD occurs in almost one-third of women and that, among the risk factors, sociocultural factors were the most strongly associated with PPD.","2013-09","2019-02-14 12:39:58","2019-02-14 12:39:58","","179-194","","2","46","","International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Power Analysis; Risk Factors; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Women's Health; P-Value; Depression, Postpartum -- Etiology; Sample Size; Multiple Logistic Regression; DSM; Depression, Postpartum -- Risk Factors; Postnatal Care; Turkey; Depression, Postpartum -- Epidemiology; Battered Women; Domestic Violence; Culture; Hospitals, Urban","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was a descriptive, longitudinal, correlational study of the relationships among these variables.Participants were 35 English-speaking nulliparous women, ages 18 to 40, 38 weeks of completed gestation or greater, with uncomplicated pregnancies. In addition, all subjects were partnered and enrolled in childbirth education programs.At enrollment, Spielbergers Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to evaluate trait anxiety, while the Prenatal Self-Evaluation Questionnaire measured childbirth-specific anxiety. Self-efficacy for childbirth was measured with the Self-Efficacy for Childbirth Inventory. Antepartum sleep disturbance was measured over the last five nights of pregnancy using the wrist actigraph (MiniMotionlogger). Pain and fatigue in early labor at home were evaluated with the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form and the Visual Analogue Scale of Fatigue Severity. A combination of medical records review and postpartum audiotaped interviews provided information about the remaining pre-hospitalization and birth variables.Data analysis demonstrated significant relationships between: anxiety and self-efficacy for childbirth in late pregnancy (r = -.59, p < 0.01), total sleep time on the night before birth (TST-1) and pain in early labor (r = -.47, p < 0.05), numbers of cognitive coping strategies used and pain scores in early labor (r = -.47, p < 0.04), and the number of hours at home in labor and admitting cervical dilation (r =.70, p < 0.001). Subject-reported components of pre-hospitalization labor included: recognition of labor onset, management of signs, symptoms, and emotions of early labor, and decision to admit to the hospital. Women employed behavioral and cognitive strategies to manage these components. Sleep parameters of women approaching childbirth revealed a pattern of increasing sleep disturbance.

Sleep continuity and structure were scored for the respective frequencies, durations and percentages of active, quiet, and indeterminate sleep and wakefulness after sleep onset. The number and duration of body movements were also analyzed.Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit at Amiens University Medical Center (France).Participants: Healthy preterm neonates (postconceptional age: 33.9 +/- 6.0 weeks) were enrolled according to whether their mothers had not smoked at all during pregnancy (control group, n = 19), smoked less during pregnancy (low-smoking group, S[low], n = 10), or smoked more (heavy-smoking group, S[heavy], n = 10) than 10 cigarettes per day throughout pregnancy.Measurements and Results: Neonates born to heavy-smoking mothers had a significantly lower mean birth weight than controls (-21%) and displayed disrupted sleep structure and continuity: they slept less overall (with a higher proportion of active sleep and a lower proportion of quiet sleep) and had more wakefulness after sleep onset. Compared with controls, neonates from both smoking groups displayed more body movements and, as a result, more disturbed sleep.Conclusions: High prenatal smoking exposure modifies sleep patterns in preterm neonates by disrupting sleep organization and increasing nocturnal body movements. These findings raise the question of the repercussions of these sleep disturbances (at what is a critical stage in brain development) on the child's physiological and neurobehavioral outcomes.","2008-12","2019-02-14 12:40:01","2019-02-14 12:40:01","","1683-1689","","12","31","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Polysomnography; Infant, Newborn; Insomnia -- Diagnosis; Gestational Age; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Birth Weight; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Smoking; Infant, Premature, Diseases -- Diagnosis; Wakefulness -- Physiology; Insomnia -- Physiopathology; Arousal -- Physiology; Infant, Premature, Diseases -- Physiopathology; Motor Activity -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The international classification of sleep disorders now includes as a new category those occurring during pregnancy. Regular physical activity is known to improve the quality of life, one aspect of which is sleep quality. During pregnancy, physical activity is decreased but should not be eliminated, as studies have reported a high correlation between sleep disorders and the absence of physical activity. Regular physical exercise during pregnancy, whether performed in water or out of it, provides greater control of gestational weight gain. Furthermore, the reduced weight gain during pregnancy, as a result of physical exercise, is associated with greater physical resistance to the demands of childbirth, combats the fatigue caused by pregnancy and reduces back pain. All of these outcomes tend to enhance sleep quality, among other beneficial effects. Objective To determine whether, in pregnant women, there is an association between moderate-intensity physical activity in an aquatic environment and sleep quality. Material and methods A randomised clinical trial was conducted with a sample of 140 pregnant women aged 21–43 years, divided into two groups; Intervention Group and Control Group. The women were recruited in the twelfth week of gestation and took part in the [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy programme from week 20 to week 37. Sleep quality was evaluated in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Results The Mann–Whitney U test showed that the results obtained were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the Intervention Group, 44 of the women (65.67%) were classified as “poor sleepers” versus 62 women (92.54%) in the Control Group.

In recent years, psychological factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and maintaining PWR. DESIGN: Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between post-partum psychological distress and PWR at 9 months, after controlling for maternal weight factors, sleep quality, sociocontextual influences, and maternal behaviours. METHOD: Pregnant women (N = 126) completed a series of questionnaires at multiple time points from early pregnancy until 9 months post-partum. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression indicated that gestational weight gain, shorter duration (6 months or less) of breastfeeding, and post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months are associated with higher PWR at 9 months; stress, depression, and anxiety had minimal influence. CONCLUSION: Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should specifically target the prevention of body dissatisfaction and excessive weight gain during pregnancy. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Post-partum weight retention (PWR) is a critical pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. Causes of PWR are complex and multifactorial. There is increasing evidence that psychological factors play a key role in predicting high PWR. What does this study add? Post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months is associated with PWR at 9 months post-birth. Post-partum depression, stress and anxiety have less influence on PWR at 9 months. Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should target body dissatisfaction.","2014-11","2019-02-14 12:40:03","2019-02-14 12:40:03","","751-766","","4","19","","British Journal of Health Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Body Weight; Socioeconomic Factors; Weight Gain; Postnatal Period -- Psychosocial Factors; Body Image","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the temporal inter-relationship between these variables has yet to be investigated.Method:Data were collected from 150 expectant couples at approximately 18, 25 and 33 weeks’ gestation.Results:After accounting for the relative stability of depression, anxiety and stress over time, for men higher levels of anxiety earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depression and stress in middle pregnancy, which predicted higher depression during late pregnancy. A similar relationship remained after partialling out the effects of partner’s depression, perceived social support and sleep quality. Further analyses also revealed significant differences in the manifestation of distress symptoms between men and women, but not between first-time and non-first-time fathers.Conclusion:Our findings indicated a possible inter-relationship between depression, anxiety and stress for men antenatally. Our findings also showed that men who reported elevated depression, anxiety and stress earlier in the antenatal period also reported elevated symptomology at later time points. Finally, the current findings revealed that antenatal paternal stress may play a key role in the development of depression and anxiety later in pregnancy.

The incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy is unknown, and it is likely that many cases go undiagnosed.Study: A systematic review and metaanalysis was undertaken to determine whether pregnant women who receive a diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing are more likely to have adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes compared with control subjects.Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl databases were searched for full-text publications in English of sleep-disordered breathing and human pregnancy up to June 2017. Only studies that reported on sleep-disordered breathing in relation to gestational age or birthweight at delivery, preterm birth, mode of delivery, cord pH, Apgar score, nursery admission, stillbirth or perinatal death, meconium at delivery, or wound complications were included.Results: A total of 1576 results were identified; 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Women with sleep-disordered breathing were older (mean difference, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.28) and had a higher body mass index (mean difference, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-4.32) than those who did not. Maternal sleep-disordered breathing was associated significantly with preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation; odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-2.31) and low birthweight (<2500 g; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.78). These women were also less likely to have a vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) and to be at a higher risk of having an assisted vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.21) or a cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.11).

Australia is unique in providing residential parenting services to support women with parenting needs such as sleep or feeding difficulties. Women who attend residential parenting services have experienced higher rates of intervention in birth and poor perinatal mental health but it is unknown how birth trauma may impact on early parenting. Aims and objectives This study aims to explore the early parenting experiences of women who have accessed residential parenting services in Australia and consider their birth was traumatic. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with eight women across Australia who had experienced birth trauma and accessed residential parenting services in the early parenting period. These interviews were conducted both face to face and over the telephone. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. Findings One overarching theme was identified: “The Perfect Storm of Trauma” which identified that the participants in this study who accessed residential parenting services were more likely to have entered pregnancy with pre-existing vulnerabilities, and experienced a culmination of traumatic events during labour, birth, and in the early parenting period. Four subthemes were identified: “Bringing Baggage to Birth”, “Trauma through a Thousand Cuts”, “Thrown into the Pressure Cooker”, and “Trying to work it all out”. Conclusion How women are cared for during their labour, birth and postnatal period impacts on how they manage early parenthood.

Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases.Objective: To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG).Process and Evidence Synthesis: The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report.Recommendations: The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial.Conclusions and Relevance: The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.","2018-11-20","2019-02-14 12:40:32","2019-02-14 12:40:32","","2020-2028","","19","320","","JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Child; Adolescence; Adult; United States; Comparative Studies; Aged; Health Promotion; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Practice Guidelines; Exercise; Chronic Disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This group of infants is often physiologically fragile and they may undergo frequent painful procedures on a daily basis. Contrary to ideas from the past, premature infants are able to feel pain, and nervous system elements required for the transmission of painful stimuli are functional by 24 weeks gestation. Painful procedures are harmful to the infant's physiological stability and the ability to selfregulate, which includes maintenance of motor control and stable sleep/wake cycles. Assessment of pain in the premature infant is complex. Major indicators of pain include facial grimaces and physiological parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) is one tool designed specifically for preterm infants. Nonpharmacological nursing measures such as swaddling or nesting and offering a pacifier are useful strategies to help infants cope with painful procedures. The nurse may also maintain a therapeutic environment to assist the infant in self-regulation. Pharmacological agents such as morphine, fentanyl, and acetaminophen are effective in relieving procedural pain. The use of oral sucrose before and during painful procedures offers new possibilities for pain relief. Recent research shows that oral sucrose is a safe and effective analgesic for short-term procedures. Research studies to determine the most effective doses and modes of oral sucrose administration are ongoing. It is thought that the relief of pain is owing to the sweet taste of the sucrose that activates endogenous pain-modulating systems.

DESIGN: Prospective double-blind cohort study. SETTING: Inpatients and outpatients managed in a day assessment unit (DAU) at St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 186 hypertensive pregnant women, 158 of whom had successful 24 h BP monitoring; 40% had proteinuric pre-eclampsia (PE), 43% gestational hypertension (GH) and 17% essential hypertension (EH). INTERVENTIONS: Blood pressure, 24 h non-invasive, monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was undertaken successfully in 158 women with PE, GH or EH, whether or not they were receiving antihypertensives. Women and clinicians were blinded to results of these BP monitors. Sleep hypertension was defined as BP > 117/68 mmHg at 26-30 weeks or > 123/72 mmHg after 30 weeks gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between women with and without sleep hypertension and the prevalence of sleep hypertension was determined. RESULTS: Sleep hypertension was present in 59%, more commonly in PE (79%) than GH/EH (45%), P < 0.0001. Sleep hypertensives also had higher routine sphygmomanometer BPs [137(10)/91(7) mmHg; mean(SD)] than women with normal sleep BP [130(12)/ 87(8) mmHg] P = 0.007, and higher awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) BPs [137(8)/88(7) versus 127(7)/79(6) mmHg], P < 0.0001. Awake, but not sleep, average heart rate was lower in sleep hypertensives [85(11) versus 91 (10) beats per minute, bpm], P = 0.002. Sleep hypertensives had a significantly greater frequency of renal insufficiency, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and episodes of (awake) severe hypertension (P < 0.05), as well as lower birth weight babies [2715 (808) versus 3224(598) g, P < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension during sleep is a common finding in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia. These women also have higher awake BPs and a greater frequency of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. These findings are largely explained by the greater likelihood of pre-eclamptics having sleep hypertension.","2001-08","2019-02-14 12:40:34","2019-02-14 12:40:34","","1437-1444","","8","19","","Journal of Hypertension","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Human; Funding Source; Chi Square Test; Prevalence; Comparative Studies; T-Tests; Pre-Eclampsia; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Circadian Rhythm; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular; Hypertension -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, we investigated the influence of numerous potential confounding maternal and child factors. Finally, we tested potential reverse temporal associations between child sleep eight weeks postpartum and maternal PTSD symptoms two years postpartum.Methods: This study is part of the population-based Akershus Birth Cohort, a prospective cohort study at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Data from the hospital's birth record, from questionnaires at 17 weeks gestation, eight weeks and two years postpartum were used. At two years postpartum, 39% of the original participants could be retained, resulting in a study population of n = 1480. All child sleep variables significantly correlated with postpartum PTSD symptoms were entered into multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors.Results: Postpartum PTSD symptoms were related to all child sleep variables, except daytime sleep duration. When all significant confounding factors were included into multivariate regression analyses, postpartum PTSD symptoms remained a significant predictor for number and duration of night wakings (β = 0.10 and β = 0.08, respectively), duration of settling time (β = 0.10), and maternal rating of their child's sleep problems (β = 0.12, all p<.01. Child sleep at eight weeks postpartum was not significantly related to maternal sleep two years postpartum when controlling for postpartum PTSD at eight weeks.Limitations: Child outcomes were based on maternal reporting and might be influenced by maternal mental health.Conclusions: Our results showed for the first time that maternal postpartum PTSD symptoms were prospectively associated with less favorable child sleep, thus increasing the risk of developmental or behavioral problems through an indirect, but treatable pathway.

A prospective, controlled trial was conducted to determine whether fetal movement counting induced anxiety or other deleterious psychological effects in low-risk primigravidas. A sample of 613 healthy pregnant women was randomly assigned at 28 weeks' gestation to fetal movement counting, sleep recording, or a nonrecording control group. State and trait of anxiety, belief in sources of personal control, and attitudes toward pregnancy and infant were assessed at 28 and 37 weeks' gestation. Participation rates were high (91.4%) across all groups. Most women (90%) assigned to count fetal movements did so on a daily basis (95% of days). No significant changes in psychological status occurred in the three groups as a result of self-monitoring conditions. Independent of group assignment, all women showed a slight increase in transient state and decrease in trait of anxiety from 28 to 37 weeks. Internal locus of control and positive attitudes toward the infant increased slightly, and feelings of well-being decreased slightly for all women. It was concluded that women are willing to record fetal activity, and that fetal movement counting does not cause deleterious psychological effects in low-risk pregnant women.","1994-09","2019-02-14 12:40:36","2019-02-14 12:40:36","","135-140","","3","21","","Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Human; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Research Instruments; Clinical Trials; Random Assignment; Demography; Control Group; Anxiety -- In Pregnancy; Fetal Movement -- Evaluation; Pretest-Posttest Design; Locus of Control -- In Pregnancy; Perinatal Death -- Prevention and Control; Attitude to Pregnancy -- Evaluation -- In Pregnancy; Consent (Research); Fetal Monitoring -- Psychosocial Factors; Maternal Attitudes -- Evaluation -- In Pregnancy; Null Hypothesis; Research Dropouts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods The participants of this study were 1,024 primigravid women in their third trimester that had already undergone an antenatal examination. Anonymous questionnaire were distributed to 40 hospitals and maternity centers in Hokkaido and returned by mail. Contents of the questionnaire consisted of information concerning fundamental attributes, pregnancy-related variables, Japanese translations of the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and questions about participants' behavior in daily life during pregnancy (such as meal habits, sleeping and exercise). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and nonparametric test. Results Of the 575 questionnaires collected, 440 were relevant to the analysis (valid response rate=43.0%). The average age of the subjects was 29, they were between 28 and 39 weeks gestation at the time. Issues that showed significant differences during the height fluctuations of maternal-fetal attachment concerned hopes and plans for the pregnancy, feelings of the pregnancy, images of the feelings and experiences subjects would have concerning the infant's care (ages 0-6 years), high self-esteem, meal habits during pregnancy, consciousness of consuming foods with higher iron content, sleeping during the day and exercise habits. Conclusion It is clinically useful to consider the behavior in daily life such as meal regularity, consciousness of consuming foods with higher iron content, allotting time to sleep during the day, and exercise as an objective index. These are issues that improve the maternal-fetal attachment. Research findings to date indicate that the consciousness of the primigravid women which values fetal well-being and growth serves as intrinsic motivation of the behavior in daily life of health.","2011-10","2019-02-14 12:40:37","2019-02-14 12:40:37","","203-214","","2","25","","Journal of Japan Academy of Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Fetus; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Psychological Tests; Scales; Primiparas; Surveys; Japan; Prenatal Bonding; Nonparametric Statistics; Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale; Self Concept; Health Behavior -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today there are an estimated one million people in the United States diagnosed with SLE, 85% of whom are women. Moderate to severe fatigue has been recognized as a major problem in 80% of cases both at the time of diagnosis and during the course of disease (Rothfield, 1985). Because of the dearth of information available in the literature which described the nature of fatigue in illness, the purpose of this study was to describe the relationship of fatigue with disease activity, depression, and sleep in women with SLE. Data were collected on 70 female subjects, diagnosed with SLE between the ages of 20 and 45 years. Each subject completed instruments designed to measure fatigue, depression, sleep, and the perception of disease activity. In addition, each subject was interviewed about disease activity and asked to briefly describe how fatigue had impacted on her life and ways she found effective to manage it. The findings revealed moderate but statistically significant correlations between fatigue with depression, disease activity, steroid dose, and perception of disease activity. Depressive symptomatology was present in 74% of the sample. Results of multiple regression analysis revealed that the most important predictor of fatigue was the patient's perception of her disease activity. Findings from this study described the presence and problematic nature of fatigue in SLE. It reinforced the need for nurses to carefully assess the presence of depression in chronic illness and to provide patients with realistic assessments of their situation and effective, realistic strategies to cope with them.","1988-01","2019-02-14 12:40:38","2019-02-14 12:40:38","","","108 p","","","","","","","","","","CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA","","","","","c8h","UMI Order PUZ8919391","EBSCOhost","","D.N.SC.","","","","Female; Interviews; Sleep; Adult; Human; Depression; Fatigue; Attitude to Health; Women; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic -- Complications; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic -- Psychosocial Factors; Steroids -- Adverse Effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The incidence and prevalence of hyperglycemia are increasing worldwide, which is cause for concern because GDM and even mild hyperglycemia are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A better understanding of sleep-related risk factors for maternal hyperglycemia is an important health matter. Evidence demonstrates associations between sleep disturbances, especially sleep-disordered breathing, and hyperglycemia, but causal effects and the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions have not been fully elucidated. Subjective sleep assessments show associations between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There are, however, few studies using objective measures to support these findings. Large prospective studies are required to examine causal relationships between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There is also a need for smaller mechanistic studies to understand the pathophysiology. Furthermore, interventional studies are required to address whether improvement of sleep parameters can prevent/decrease the risk of developing maternal hyperglycemia. Taken together, the data suggests that sleep disturbances during pregnancy are important to identify and manage in order to minimize maternal hyperglycemia and GDM, and improve maternal and fetal well-being.","2014-02","2019-02-14 12:40:40","2019-02-14 12:40:40","","459-459","","2","14","","Current Diabetes Reports","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Epidemiology; Sleep Disorders -- Epidemiology; Sleep Disorders -- Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational -- Etiology; Hyperglycemia -- Epidemiology; Hyperglycemia -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report on the distribution of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution in the first trimester and on the association between TCM constitution and maternal symptoms related to pregnancy. Methods. Participants were followed up until delivery to observe primary measures (gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus) and secondary measures (signs of miscarriage, miscarriage, nausea and vomiting, and sleepiness and defecation during pregnancy). Descriptive analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis were used in this study. Results. 61.8% of the participants had unbalanced constitutions. We did not find a significant association between the TCM constitution and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, signs of miscarriage, and defecation during pregnancy. And we found that women with unbalanced constitutions in early pregnancy had a greater likelihood of severe nausea and vomiting and poor sleep during pregnancy in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions. These results have implications for female health care providers and policy makers. Identification of TCM constitution may be helpful for understanding nausea and vomiting and poor sleepiness during pregnancy, especially in the condition that can not be explained by modern medical science, and be helpful for making program to improve these uncomfortable symptoms.","2016-03-20","2019-02-14 12:40:41","2019-02-14 12:40:41","","1-8","","","2016","","Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Logistic Regression; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; T-Tests; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Sleep Disorders; Diabetes Mellitus, Gestational; Nonexperimental Studies; China; Nausea and Vomiting; Abortion, Spontaneous; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension; Body Constitution -- In Pregnancy; Defecation; Medicine, Chinese Traditional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A cross-sectional study was conducted at public health clinics in Hamadan city, Iran between July and December 2015. In total, 380 pregnant women were selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory and General Health Questionnaire. Perceived stress was assessed through an interview comprised of open-ended questions. The final PATH model fit well; general health (β = 0.02) as well as anxiety and sleep disorders (β = 0.03) were slightly directly associated with perceived stress, and only planning-preparation was related to perceived stress through general health (β = 0.09). The findings enhance the knowledge gained from previous perinatal stress research. General health status was directly related to stress, and coping style was indirectly related to stress. Coping styles may mediate the relationship between general health status and perceived stress, suggesting that midwives should attempt to improve the general health of women to reduce stress and its consequences during pregnancy by teaching patients appropriate coping styles. Further studies on the effect of coping style interventions on stress are warranted.","2019-01","2019-02-14 12:40:42","2019-02-14 12:40:42","","41-54","","1","59","","Women & Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Human; Health Knowledge; Sleep Disorders; Health Status; Iran; Health Promotion; Models, Statistical; Stratified Random Sample; Coping; Stress, Psychological -- Prevention and Control; Patient Education; Stress, Psychological -- Diagnosis; Anxiety Disorders; Stress, Psychological -- Risk Factors -- In Pregnancy; Expectant Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors -- Iran; Hospitals, Public -- Iran; Midwives -- Psychosocial Factors; Open-Ended Questionnaires; Psychotherapy -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research reveals an association between poor sleep quality/quantity and symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychosis. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence for the relationship between sleep and postpartum mental disorders.Methods: Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost CINAHL through June 30, 2014. Manual searching was performed on reference lists of included articles. Published primary research in any language was included.Results: There were 3187 unique titles/abstracts and 44 full-text articles reviewed. Thirty-one studies were included. Evidence was found for the impact of self-reported poor sleep during pregnancy and the postpartum on the development of postpartum depression, with not enough evidence for either postpartum anxiety or psychosis. The evidence for objectively assessed sleep and the development of postpartum disorders was mixed. Among the 31 studies included, 1 was strong, 13 were moderate and 17 were weak.Limitations: Research design, method of assessment, timing of assessment, recruitment strategies, representative adequacy of the samples and inclusion/exclusion criteria all varied widely. Many studies did not use tools validated for the perinatal population and had small sample sizes without power analysis.Conclusions: Sleep interventions represent a potential low-cost, non-pharmacological prevention and treatment strategy for postpartum mental illness. Further high-quality research is needed on this topic area.","2015-05","2019-02-14 12:40:44","2019-02-14 12:40:44","","65-77","","","176","","Journal of Affective Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four behavioral states were documented in the 36-38 week fetus that closely paralleled the six behavioral states of waking and sleeping in the neonate. The comparison of these states during late gestation and the early newborn period was the focus of the study. A time series, multiple case study approach was used to examine the relationship between fetal and newborn activity patterns. Eighteen subjects recorded fetal activity during the last month of pregnancy, and continued recording the newborn's activity during the first two weeks after birth. The NCAST Sleep/Activity Record, developed by Dr. Kathryn Barnard as part of the Nursing Child Assessment Project (1978) was used to record newborn activity. A researcher-modified version of the NCASA was used to record fetal activity. Daily Appointment Schedules were used to record maternal activity during the prenatal period. Interviews were conducted with each family to obtain demographic, lifestyle, and delivery information. Analysis of the data was completed on an individual case basis using a time series method called pattern matching. Graphs representing the patterns of fetal activity and newborn activity were matched to identify similarities and differences. Striking similarities were identified in fifteen of the eighteen subjects. Fifteen of the eighteen subjects had significant Pearson correlations at least at the p < .05 level when comparing fetal and newborn patterns of activity. Correlations with maternal activity were questionable or non-significant. This study supported the concept that fetal activity emerges as definable patterns of quiet and active periods during the last month of pregnancy. Regardless of maternal activity and the birth process, the patterns of fetal activity continued into the first few weeks of the newborn's life. Nursing implications. Pregnant women should be encouraged to monitor fetal activity during the last month of pregnancy in order to identify patterns of fetal and potentially newborn activity. Identification of rhythmicity in the newborn could enhance the adaptive behaviors of the mother and her family when the newborn baby comes into the home.

However, the relationship of RLS to history of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), a predictor of subsequent CVD, diabetes, and associated conditions, remains little explored. In this study, we investigated the relationship of RLS to history of PIH in a sample of primary care patients. Methods: Participants were women aged ≥40 years drawn from an anonymous survey study of West Virginia primary care patients. Data collected included detailed information on demographics, lifestyle factors, sleep patterns, and reproductive/medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic questionnaire. Women who were pregnant or unsure about their pregnancy status were excluded from the analyses. Results: Of the 498 participants in the final analytic sample, 24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms ≥once/week, 11.9% with symptoms ≥3 times/week); 73 (16.5% of parous women) reported a history of PIH, defined as physician-diagnosed preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle characteristics, obesity, reproductive history, health conditions, and other factors, those reporting a history of PIH were approximately twice as likely to meet criteria for RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 3.6). These associations increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (adjusted OR for RLS with symptoms ≥3 times/week = 3.8; CI 1.9, 7.6; p for trend = 0.003). Conclusions: History of PIH was strongly and positively related to current RLS in this study of primary care patients; these findings further support a possible role for metabolic dysregulation in RLS etiology.","2016-04","2019-02-14 12:40:47","2019-02-14 12:40:47","","397-408","","4","25","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Middle Age; Restless Legs; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; T-Tests; Confidence Intervals; Mann-Whitney U Test; Multiple Logistic Regression; Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension -- Risk Factors; West Virginia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation, but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia), hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes, risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus, the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks, likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to consider alternative treatments if available.","2016-08","2019-02-14 12:40:51","2019-02-14 12:40:51","","270-288","","5","85","","Psychotherapy & Psychosomatics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Risk Factors; Clinical Assessment Tools; Depression -- Drug Therapy; Antidepressive Agents -- Adverse Effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Long-term sleep disturbance and fatigue can have significant implications for physical and mental health, relationships, employment and parental competence. Most studies focus on the quality and quantity of maternal sleep between weeks one and six postpartum. We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery. Thirty first-time mothers completed a postnatal sleep questionnaire, detailing their total sleep time (TST), the reasons for being awake and their level of fatigue. The logs were completed in real time during the first 48 h postpartum, while they were still in a hospital environment. The data collected from the mothers in the study indicated that the mean TST in the first 48 h was 9.7 h. Of the factors explored only breastfeeding influenced the TST. Breastfeeding women slept on average 2.6 h longer than women who bottle-fed (p = .042). Impact statement What is already known on this subject: Childbearing affects women's sleep in many ways. Hormonal changes during pregnancy and postpartum as well as physiological and anatomical alterations, and the process of adaptation to the new parent's responsibilities contribute to changes in sleep architecture. Since first study of sleep and pregnancy published in 1968 there have been very few publications addressing maternal sleep postpartum. Most studies which have focussed on quality of maternal sleep in the first 6-months postpartum period describe the relationships between poor maternal sleep and postpartum depression and other mental health outcomes. What the results of this study add: We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery while they remained in the hospital environment. We found that environmental factors such as background noise, shared rooms, type of delivery, feeding and worrying about the neonate did not influence the total sleep time, however, the main outcome of our study is that breastfeeding promotes maternal sleep. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: We believe that this study would be of interest to many obstetricians, general practitioners, nurses and midwives as well as to the general public. Appropriate counselling of patients early in postnatal period can improve their sleep patterns and reduce the risk of depression and other abnormal physical, psychological and social outcomes.","2018-04","2019-02-14 12:40:52","2019-02-14 12:40:52","","316-320","","3","38","","Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Infant, Newborn; Comparative Studies; Fatigue; Postnatal Period; Time Factors; Sleep -- Physiology; Mothers; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Breast Feeding -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Parity; Wakefulness -- Physiology; Bottle Feeding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Breastfed babies grow more slowly during infancy than formula-fed babies. Among offspring exposed in utero to maternal glucose intolerance, prospective data on growth during infancy have been unavailable. Thus, scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that breastfeeding reduces the risk of obesity among the offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM). To address this gap, we devised the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM Pregnancy and Growth of their Offspring, also known as the SWIFT Offspring Study. This prospective, longitudinal study recruited mother-infant pairs from the SWIFT Study, a prospective study of women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The goal of the SWIFT Offspring Study is to determine whether breastfeeding intensity and duration, compared with formula feeding, are related to slower growth of GDM offspring during the first year life. This article details the study design, participant eligibility, data collection, and methodologies. We also describe the baseline characteristics of the GDM mother-infant pairs.Methods: The study enrolled 466 mother-infant pairs among GDM deliveries in northern California from 2009-2011. Participants attended three in-person study exams at 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after delivery for infant anthropometry (head circumference, body weight, length, abdominal circumference and skinfold thicknesses), as well as maternal anthropometry (body weight, waist circumference and percent body fat). Mothers also completed questionnaires on health and lifestyle behaviors, including infant diet, sleep and temperament. Breastfeeding intensity and duration were assessed via several sources (diaries, telephone interviews, monthly mailings and in-person exams) from birth through the first year of life. Pregnancy course, clinical perinatal and newborn outcomes were obtained from health plan electronic medical records. Infant saliva samples were collected and stored for genetics studies.Discussion: This large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of GDM offspring will enable evaluation of the relationship of infant feeding to growth during infancy independent of perinatal characteristics, sociodemographics and other risk factors. The longitudinal design provides the first quantitative measures of breastfeeding intensity and duration among GDM offspring during early life.","2015-01","2019-02-14 12:40:53","2019-02-14 12:40:53","","150-150","","1","15","","BMC Pregnancy & Childbirth","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about fathers and their transition to parenthood. This study focused on the 24-hour rhythms of 101 Japanese couples at 32-36 weeks gestation and 4-5 weeks after birth.Repeated measures analysis of variance and time series methods were used to test for postpartum changes in sleep and rhythm for mothers and fathers having their first child. The strength of the sleep-wake rhythm over a 7-day period significantly decreased over time and was not different by gender. Chronotype shifted significantly from morning type toward more evening type; mothers were more morning chronotype than fathers at both time points. Mothers became less consistent in their social rhythms, whereas fathers became more consistent in their rhythms.After sleeping arrangement was controlled, changes in wake-sleep rhythm strength and chronotype did not appear. The interaction of gender and sleeping arrangement had a statistically significant effect on wake-sleep rhythm strength. If the father's sleep-wake rhythm strength was higher than mother at third trimester, the couple was more likely to sleep together with baby after birth; if his rhythm strength was lower than mother's, only the mother slept with baby, and the father slept elsewhere.Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine how much variance in mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks after birth could be explained by family synchronizers as predictor variables after other mother-related variables were controlled. As a result, 25% of the variance in mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks after birth was explained by three predictor variables: income, mother's chronotype at third trimester, and consistency of father's postpartum social rhythm. The results from this study challenge health care providers to focus on how they can help childbearing couples who are experiencing irregular daily patterns. Future research should be aimed at how the mother's rhythm strength and father's daily social rhythm affects maternal-infant attachment and coping with her new maternal role.","2003-01","2019-02-14 12:40:54","2019-02-14 12:40:54","","","165 p","","","","","","","","","","University of California, San Francisco","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3088649","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Sleep; Infant; Human; Fathers; Infant, Newborn; Male; Postnatal Period; Analysis of Variance; Mothers; Repeated Measures; Multiple Regression; Adaptation, Psychological; Time Series; Japanese; Parenthood; Periodicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Symptoms at this time are thought to be qualitatively different from those in childbearing years, and to present with milder symptoms of depression, increased agitation, and fatigue. This research aimed to determine whether depressive symptoms during perimenopause can be distinguished from those in the childbearing years. Methods: Seventy-four depressed women who were either perimenopausal (n = 40) or in their childbearing years (n = 34) were recruited (M = 40.11; SD = 11 years). Participants completed a series of questionnaires relating to depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), various mood states (Profile of Mood States), and changes in sleep patterns. Results: Univariate relationships between symptoms and perimenopausal status were assessed. All significant variables (anger-hostility, depression, tension-anxiety, fatigue-inertia, and changes in sleep quality) were analysed via logistic regression. Mood profile at these two different life stages were differentiated based on lower levels of depression symptoms and tensionanxiety, and increased levels of anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and sleep disturbance in the perimenopausal women as compared with the childbearing group. Conclusions: This research supports the unique presentation of perimenopausal depression. The identification of a unique symptomatic profile provides targets for intervention and allows for different treatment options.","2015-07","2019-02-14 12:40:56","2019-02-14 12:40:56","","76-84","","2","19","","Clinical Psychologist","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients with pre-eclampsia show upper airway narrowing during sleep. The present study aimed to compare upper airway dimensions in pregnant and nonpregnant women and in patients with pre-eclampsia. A total of 50 women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 37 women with pre-eclampsia were recruited consecutively from the antenatal service and matched with 50 nonpregnant women. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Snoring was reported by 14% of nonpregnant women, 28% of pregnant women, and 75% of pre-eclamptic women (p < 0.001). When seated, pregnant women had wider upper airways than nonpregnant women (p < 0.02), but there was no difference when supine. Oropharyngeal junction area in the seated position was less (p < 0.01) in the women with pre-eclampsia (mean +/- SD: 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2) than either nonpregnant (1.1 +/- 0.1 cm2) or pregnant women (1.3 +/- 0.1 cm2). Supine oropharyngeal junction area was less in the women with pre-eclampsia than in the nonpregnant women (0.8 +/- 0.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.1 cm2; p = 0.01) but similar in women with pre-eclampsia and pregnant women (0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2; p > 0.3). The study showed that women with pre-eclampsia have upper airway narrowing in both upright and supine postures. These changes could contribute to the upper airway resistance episodes during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may further increase their blood pressure.","2012-07-25","2019-02-14 12:40:57","2019-02-14 12:40:57","","137-140","","2","167","","American Journal of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Analysis of Variance; P-Value; Pre-Eclampsia -- Etiology; Respiratory System -- Pathology -- In Pregnancy; Snoring -- Etiology -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intervention(s): Chiropractic care (i.e., The Webster Technique, spinal adjustments, and adjunctive therapies). Main outcome measures: The RAND VSQ9 to measure visit-specific satisfaction and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®)-29 to measure QoL. Results: A convenience sample of 343 pregnant patients (average age = 30.96 years) comprised their study population.

Paternal perinatal weight gain may set weight trajectories in midlife and have long-term health implications. Since men do not undergo the physical demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding, the specific mechanisms underlying weight gain in new fathers warrant investigation. This review aims to stimulate research on paternal perinatal weight gain by suggesting testable potential mechanisms that (1) show change across the transition to parenthood and (2) play a role in weight and body composition. We identify seven mechanisms, within three categories: behavioural mechanisms (sleep, physical activity, and diet), hormonal mechanisms (testosterone and cortisol), and psychological mechanisms (depression and stress). We also discuss direct effects of partner pregnancy influences (e.g., ‘couvade syndrome’) on men’s body weight. In presenting each mechanism, we discuss how it may be affected by the transition to parenthood, and then review its role in body composition and weight. Next, we describe bidirectional and interactive effects, discuss timing, and present three broad research questions to propel theoretical development.","2018-09","2019-02-14 12:40:59","2019-02-14 12:40:59","","294-311","","3","12","","Health Psychology Review","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Sleep; Physical Activity; Depression; Diet; Fathers; Weight Gain; Stress; Body Composition; Hydrocortisone; Couvade; Fatherhood; Men's Health; Paternal Behavior; Testosterone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serum IMA and TAC (using the ferric reducing power of plasma method) were measured. Serum thiol/disulfide homeostasis was determined by a novel automated method.Results: The mean age of the pregnant women with OSAS was 31.0 ± 4.7 years with a mean gestational age of 36.5 ± 3.0 weeks.

We observed four distinctive trajectories of depressive symptoms and three trajectories of fatigue using group-based trajectory modeling. A frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these symptoms was found; that is, mothers in the high-risk depressive symptoms group were most likely to fall into the high-risk group for fatigue. Joint trajectories were predicted by poor sleep score (odds ratio = 2.96, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 7.3) using multinomial logistic regression analysis.

Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11–17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0–4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories. Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43). Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments.","2012-11","2019-02-14 12:41:05","2019-02-14 12:41:05","","475-483","","5","51","","Journal of Adolescent Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Child; Questionnaires; Adolescence; Human; Male; Descriptive Statistics; Checklists; Predictive Value of Tests; Sex Factors; Multiple Logistic Regression; Child Behavior Checklist; Child Behavior Disorders -- Etiology; Emotions -- Evaluation -- In Adolescence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although it is commonly accepted that subjective sleep quality declines during pregnancy and the transition to parenthood, some women may follow qualitatively distinct trajectories.Design, Setting, and Participants: Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected from 293 women at four time points: during early pregnancy, at Time 1 (T1; < 22 w gestational age [GA]; late pregnancy, at Time 2 (T2; 32 w GA); during the postnatal period at Time 3 (T3; 3 mo postpartum); and Time 4 (T4; 6 mo postpartum). A group-based semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate patterns of sleep quality throughout the perinatal period.Results: Four trajectory groups were identified, including patterns defined by high sleep quality throughout (21.5%), mild decrease in sleep quality (59.5%), significant decrease in sleep quality (12.3%) and a group with poor sleep quality throughout (6.7%). Women who had the worst sleep quality at Time 1 and those who experienced significant increases in sleep problems throughout pregnancy were also the groups who reported the highest levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and the lowest levels of social support. After controlling for covariates, the groups with worst subjective sleep quality during pregnancy were also the most likely to experience high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.Conclusions: Most of the women in our sample reported mild sleep disturbances through the perinatal period. A subgroup of women reported a significant decline in sleep quality from early to late pregnancy and another reported poor subjective sleep quality throughout pregnancy; these groups had the greatest risk of experiencing high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.","2015-08","2019-02-14 12:41:05","2019-02-14 12:41:05","","1237-1245","","8","38","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. RESULTS: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance. CONCLUSION: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention.","2007-12","2019-02-14 12:41:07","2019-02-14 12:41:07","","1712-1727","","12","30","","Sleep","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Clinical Trials; Fluoxetine -- Therapeutic Use; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic -- Adverse Effects; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic -- Therapeutic Use; Benzhydryl Compounds -- Adverse Effects; Benzhydryl Compounds -- Therapeutic Use; Central Nervous System Stimulants -- Adverse Effects; Central Nervous System Stimulants -- Therapeutic Use; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence -- Drug Therapy; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence -- Etiology; Fluoxetine -- Adverse Effects; Medical Practice, Evidence-Based; Narcolepsy -- Drug Therapy; Narcolepsy -- Etiology; Sodium Oxybate -- Adverse Effects; Sodium Oxybate -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that sleep disordered breathing may link preeclampsia with reduced fetal movements (a marker of fetal health), and that treatment of sleep disordered breathing might improve fetal activity during sleep. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: First, a method of fetal movement recording was validated against ultrasound in 20 normal third trimester pregnancies. Second, fetal movement was measured overnight with concurrent polysomnography in 20 patients with preeclampsia and 20 control subjects during third trimester. Third, simultaneous polysomnography and fetal monitoring was done in 10 additional patients with preeclampsia during a control night and during a night of nasal CPAP. INTERVENTION: Overnight continuous positive airway pressure. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Women with preeclampsia had inspiratory flow limitation and an increased number of oxygen desaturations during sleep (P = 0.008), particularly during REM sleep. Preeclampsia was associated with reduced total fetal movements overnight (319 [SD 32]) versus controls (689 [SD 160], P < 0.0001) and a change in fetal movement patterns. The number of fetal hiccups was also substantially reduced in preeclampsia subjects (P < 0.0001). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment increased the number of fetal movements and hiccups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure in improving fetal movements suggests a pathogenetic role for sleep disordered breathing in the reduced fetal activity and possibly in the poorer fetal outcomes associated with preeclampsia.

To further reduce risk of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants sleep on their backs on a separate sleep surface. Our objective was to describe trends and factors associated with breastfeeding and infant sleep practices in Georgia. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 2004-2013 data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Chi square tests for trends were utilized to determine whether there were significant linear trends in breastfeeding and infant sleep overtime and by survey phase. After exclusions, 4643 cases remained for analysis. From 2004 to 2013, there was a slight (insignificant) decrease in breastfeeding initiation, with the highest proportion in 2010 (79.9%) and the lowest in 2013 (66.9%). Rates of exclusive breastfeeding increased significantly from 2004 (31.3%) to 2013 (81.7%). During that time, the proportion of infants being placed back to sleep slightly decreased (though not significantly), from 59.7 to 48.9%. The proportion of mothers who reported never bed-sharing increased significantly from 26.7 to 45.1% over this period. The decreasing breastfeeding initiation rates in Georgia diverge from national upward trends, however, exclusive breastfeeding rates by survey phase were slightly higher than national trends. Our results suggest the need for targeted education and support for breastfeeding and safe sleep practices. State-level trends data on breastfeeding and infant sleep practices provide valuable information for state-level public health professionals and policy makers, health care providers, and breastfeeding and safe sleep advocates.","2018-06","2019-02-14 12:41:09","2019-02-14 12:41:09","","496-507","","3","43","","Journal of Community Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Sudden Infant Death -- Prevention and Control; Human; Chi Square Test; Time Factors; Breast Feeding -- Trends; Georgia; Reports; Risk Assessment -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess non-transient risk factors, we also enrolled a control group of 158 pregnant women at their regular prenatal care visits matched to cases by gestational age and calendar time. The index time was defined as the onset of PTL/PPROM (for cases) or interview (for controls). Detailed data were collected through structured interviews regarding factors of interest during the 72 h that preceded the index time. Within case subjects, we compared the frequency of transient factors from 0 to 24 h before index time with that from 48 to 72 h before index time, and estimated matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results: Previously hypothesised chronic risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery, including mood disorders and stressful events, were more common among cases than among controls. Within cases, skipped meals [OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2, 15.2], disturbed sleep [OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5, 13.3], sexual activity [OR 6.0, 95% CI 0.7, 69.8], and intake of spicy foods [OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.6, 30.8] were associated with an increased risk for PTL/PPROM within the subsequent 24 h. For physical exertion and other potential risk factors evaluated, the OR was close to the null.Conclusion: Skipping meals and disturbed sleep may be associated with imminent PTL/PPROM; sexual activity and spicy food may trigger PTL/PPROM in susceptible women. Larger case-crossover studies will be able to evaluate the impact of modifiable risk factors and acute predictors of PTL/PPROM, and might help guide obstetrical management.","2014-03","2019-02-14 12:41:10","2019-02-14 12:41:10","","79-87","","2","28","","Paediatric & Perinatal Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Case Control Studies; Female; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Risk Factors; Gestational Age; Food Habits; Prenatal Care -- Methods; Pregnancy, High Risk; Predictive Value of Tests; Labor, Premature -- Prevention and Control; Pilot Studies; Crossover Design; Sleep Deprivation; Labor, Premature -- Epidemiology; Coitus; Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture -- Epidemiology; Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture -- Etiology; Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture -- Prevention and Control; Labor, Premature -- Etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty-two pregnant women who were considered high risk for the development of preeclampsia underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring between 18 and 30 weeks gestation, while their condition was normotensive according to routine mercury sphygmomanometry. One hundred sixty-four healthy primigravid women who were considered at usual risk for preeclampsia underwent the same tests as a parallel study. Routine blood pressure, awake and sleep average blood pressure, and 24-hour mean average blood pressure were entered into multiple logistic regression as predictors of either preeclampsia or gestational hypertension; significant variables were then tested by a series of receiver operator curves. RESULTS: Eight percent of usual risk and 45% of high risk women experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In both groups, the average routine mercury blood pressure and awake, sleeping, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived blood pressure were significantly higher in women who later experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In usual risk women, 24-hour systolic blood pressure of >or=115 mm Hg and sleeping systolic blood pressure of >or=106 mm Hg were predictive of later preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but sensitivities were low (77% and 54%, respectively). In high risk women, sleeping diastolic blood pressure of >or=62 mm Hg and sleeping mean arterial pressure of >or=79 mm Hg were predictive of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but again sensitivities were low (70% and 65%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Awake and sleeping blood pressure are higher in midpregnancy in women who later experience the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a noninvasive method of selecting some of these women, but this test has a sensitivity no better than that of other predictive tests, even in women at high risk for preeclampsia.","2001-09","2019-02-14 12:41:13","2019-02-14 12:41:13","","618-622","","3","185","","American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Descriptive Statistics; T-Tests; Confidence Intervals; P-Value; Predictive Value of Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Pre-Eclampsia -- Diagnosis; Multiple Logistic Regression; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position.Methods: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home sleep studies.Results: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age 28.3±6.9weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0-82.9%).Conclusion: Our data suggest that if supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education regarding sleep position.Practice Implications: Most pregnant women spend time asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy.","2014-06","2019-02-14 12:41:16","2019-02-14 12:41:16","","315-317","","6","90","","Early Human Development","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Sleep; Pregnancy; Adult; Human; Pregnancy Complications; Supine Position; Perinatal Death; Hemodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enhanced ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia may protect from deficient gas exchange, but sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may predispose to adverse events. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep and breathing in healthy pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls, with a focus on CO2 changes and upper-airway flow limitation.Methods: Healthy women in the third trimester and healthy non-pregnant women with normal body mass index (BMI) were recruited for polysomnography. Conventional analysis of sleep and breathing was performed. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) was determined for each sleep stage. Flow-limitation was analyzed using the flattening index and TcCO2 values were recorded for every inspiration.Results: Eighteen pregnant women and 12 controls were studied. Pregnancy was associated with shorter sleep duration and more superficial sleep. Apnea-hypopnea index, arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation, flow-limitation, snoring or periodic leg movements were similar in the two groups. Mean SaO2 and minimum SaO2 were lower and average heart rate was higher in the pregnant group. TcCO2 levels did not differ between groups but variance of TcCO2 was smaller in pregnant women during non-rapid eye movement (NREM). TcCO2 profiles showed transient TcCO2 peaks, which seem specific to pregnancy.Conclusions: Healthy pregnancy does not predispose to SDB. Enhanced ventilatory control manifests as narrowing threshold of TcCO2 between wakefulness and sleep. Pregnant women have a tendency for rapid CO2 increases during sleep which might have harmful consequences if not properly compensated.","2017-08","2019-02-14 12:41:49","2019-02-14 12:41:49","","67-74","","","36","","Sleep Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Young Adult; Polysomnography; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Sleep -- Physiology; Pregnancy Complications -- Metabolism; Wakefulness -- Physiology; Respiration; Carbon Dioxide -- Metabolism; Sleep Apnea Syndromes -- Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of various drugs tried in this condition, valproate effectively treats all types of seizures seen in J.M.E. Among valproate side effects, neural tube defects (NTD) in the offspring, is a deterring factor in its use in childbearing period. To avoid NTD, most authorities advise on switching to AED drug before conception.As well, the effects of valproate on male fertility is feared of. Clonazepam controls only the myoclonic jerks, leaving the patients unprotected and susceptible to generalized seizures, which mostly occur in the morning after sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is the most prevalent precipitating factor for generalized seizures in these patients.Materials &MethodsBetween Jan 2003 & April 2008, 15 newly diagnosed JME patients (9 girls, 6 boys), were given clonazepam (1.0-4.0 mg) at bedtime, and were compared to 16 patients on valproate treatment. All were advised to avoid sleep deprivation.ResultsThis study showed, all patients in the clonazepam group, (100%) had full control of their myoclonic jerks; 4(26.6%) had breakthrough episodes of generalized seizures, provoked by sleep deprivation; the rest (11,73.4%), were in full remission of their myoclonic and generalized seizures. In control group, 2(12.5%), had episodes of breakthrough, sleep-deprived, generalized seizures;the rest(14, 87.5%) were in remission. Statistically, there was no significance between the results in both groups. Clonazepam side effects were limited to mild to moderate drowsiness in the morning, eliminated by giving the dose earlier at night.ConclusionThe study suggests that if J.M.E. patients avoid sleep deprivation, they can be treated with clonazepam alone to avoid side effects of valproate","2009-12","2019-02-14 12:41:51","2019-02-14 12:41:51","","13-16","","3","3","","Iranian Journal of Child Neurology","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Male; Sleep -- Physiology; Sleep Deprivation -- Complications; Clonazepam -- Administration and Dosage; Clonazepam -- Adverse Effects; Clonazepam -- Therapeutic Use; Epilepsy, Partial -- Diagnosis; Neurology; Patient Compliance -- Evaluation; Valproic Acid -- Therapeutic Use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient.","2007-12","2019-02-14 12:41:52","2019-02-14 12:41:52","","1135-1150","","10","13","","Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Depression -- Therapy; Anxiety -- Therapy; Sleep Disorders -- Therapy; Health Promotion -- Methods; Medicine, Herbal; Plant Extracts -- Therapeutic Use; Alzheimer's Disease -- Therapy; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mind Body Techniques; Neoplasms -- Drug Therapy; Neoplasms -- Therapy; Parkinson Disease -- Therapy; Plants, Medicinal; Primary Health Care -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Sixteen pregnant women, mean age (SD) = 29.8 (5.4) years, average gestational age (SD) = 28.6 (6.3) weeks, mean body mass index (SD) = 44.7 (6.9) kg/m(2) with signs and symptoms of OSA wore the ARES Unicorder during one night of laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG was scored according to AASM 2007 criteria, and PSG AHI and RDI were compared to the ARES 1%, 3%, and 4% AHIs calculated with the ARES propriety software. RESULTS: Median PSG AHI and PSG RDI were 3.1 and 10.3 events/h of sleep, respectively. Six women had a PSG AHI >= 5 events/h of sleep and 11 had a PSG RDI >= 5 events/h of sleep. PSG AHI and RDI were strongly correlated with the ARES AHI measures. When compared with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, the ARES 3% algorithm provided the best balance between sensitivity (1.0 for PSG AHI, 0.91 for PSG RDI) and specificity (0.5 for PSG AHI, 0.8 for PSG RDI) for detecting sleep disordered breathing in our sample.

A total of 228 first‐trimester pregnant women participated in the study, which was conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .85), adequate corrected item‐total correlations (from.40 to.67), and acceptable test–retest reliability over 7 days (ICC = .73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a one‐factor structure with item loadings between.49 and.77. Significant associations with the Medical Outcomes Study Short‐Form Health Survey 12 version 2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index supported criterion‐related and convergent validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 total scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Ceiling effects were observed for all items, but no floor or ceiling effects were found for total scores. Findings suggest that the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 is a valid and reliable instrument to identify important effects of sleep‐related impairment in Chinese women during pregnancy.

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, women in their third trimester of pregnancy underwent full overnight home PSG using the 22-channel MediPalm system and the Watch-PAT 200 device. PSGs were scored by a blinded, experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria; the Watch-PAT was scored automatically by the manufacturer's proprietary software. RESULTS: A total of 31 pregnant women were studied. Mean age was 30.2 ± 7.1 years; mean gestational age was 33.4 ± 3.0 weeks; mean BMI was 31.9 ± 8.1 kg/m(2); 39% of women were nulliparous. Key variables generated by PSG and Watch-PAT correlated well over a wide range, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, r = 0.76, p < 0.001); respiratory disturbance index (RDI, r = 0.68, p < 0.001), mean oxygen saturation (r = 0.94, p < 0.001), and minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.88, p < 0.001). The area under the curve for AHI >= 5 and RDI >= 10 were 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Association between stage 3 sleep on PSG and deep sleep on Watch-PAT was poor. Watch-PAT tended to overscore RDI, particularly as severity increased. CONCLUSIONS: Among pregnant women, Watch-PAT demonstrates excellent sensitivity and specificity for identification of obstructive sleep apnea, defined as AHI >= 5 on full PSG.

The goal of the present study was to examine the validity of somatic symptoms as indicators of depression during pregnancy. The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) was administered to a cross-sectional sample of 255 pregnant women as well as 820 women from five community-based samples, who served as a control group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the fit of a single-factor model of depression in pregnant and community samples. Multigroup CFA was used to test the invariance of the factor loadings of eight depression-related symptom scales. The fit for a one-factor model was adequate for both the pregnant and community samples. All eight IDAS scales were valuable indicators of depression in the community group; however, Appetite Loss and Appetite Gain were poor indicators of depression among the pregnant women. The factor loadings for Lassitude and Appetite Gain were significantly weaker amongst the pregnant women than community women. The magnitude of the factor loadings for Insomnia and Well Being were significantly greater for the pregnant group. With the exception of appetite disturbance, somatic symptoms, though a common occurrence during pregnancy, are valid indicators of depression during pregnancy. When assessing for prenatal depression, somatic symptoms should not necessarily be dismissed as normative pregnancy experiences.","2013-06","2019-02-14 12:41:55","2019-02-14 12:41:55","","203-210","","3","16","","Archives of Women's Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Iowa; Adolescence; Adult; Human; Funding Source; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Statistics; Psychological Tests; Validation Studies; Instrument Validation; Factor Analysis; Goodness of Fit Chi Square Test; Depression -- Diagnosis -- In Pregnancy; Somatoform Disorders -- Diagnosis -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5-27.1 years). The principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic snoring. RESULTS: The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education, height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study with an incidental sample performed in a tertiary hospital neonatal unit. PATIENTS: 23 IDM and 22 healthy newborns born between 2010 and 2013. INTERVENTIONS: All underwent video-EEG recording lasting >90 min at 48-72 h of life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We analysed the percentage of indeterminate sleep, transient sharp waves per hour and mature-for-gestational age EEG patterns (discontinuity, maximum duration of interburst interval (IBI), asynchrony, asymmetry, [delta] brushes, encoches frontales and [alpha]/ rolandic activity). The group of IDM was divided into two subgroups according to maternal HbA1c: (1) HbA1c>=6% and (2) HbA1c<6%. RESULTS: Compared with healthy newborns, IDM presented significantly higher percentage of indeterminate sleep (57% vs 25%; p<0.001), discontinuity (2.5% vs 0%; p=0.044) and [delta] brushes in the bursts (6% vs 3%; p=0.024); higher duration of IBI (0.3 s vs 0 s; p=0.017); fewer encoches frontales (7/h vs 35/h; p<0.001), reduced /[alpha] rolandic activity (3/h vs 9/h; p<0.001); and more transient sharp waves (25/h vs 5/h; p<0.001). IDM with maternal HbA1c>=6% showed greater percentage of [delta] brushes in the burst (14% vs 4%; p=0.007).

The study included 57 families that were recruited during pregnancy. Maternal and infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries for 5 nights. Both fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. The results demonstrated moderate improvement in infant and maternal sleep percent between 3 and 6 months. Maternal sleep percent at 3 months significantly predicted infant sleep percent at 6 months. Greater paternal involvement in infant daytime and nighttime caregiving at 3 months significantly predicted more consolidated maternal and infant sleep at 6 months. These findings suggest that maternal sleep is an important predictor of infant sleep and that increased involvement of fathers in infant caregiving responsibilities may contribute to improvements in both maternal and infant sleep during the first 6 months postpartum.","2015-03","2019-02-14 12:41:56","2019-02-14 12:41:56","","107-124","","1","80","","Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Infant; Adult; Human; Male; Descriptive Statistics; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Summated Rating Scaling; Paired T-Tests; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Socioeconomic Factors; Diaries; Mothers; Israel; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Infant Development; Actigraphy; Postnatal Care; Structural Equation Modeling; Sleep -- Physiology -- In Infancy and Childhood; Paternal Role","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 200 mainly Māori pregnant women were recruited from deprived areas of New Zealand. They were randomized to receive a bassinet or wahakura and asked to sleep the infant in this device from birth. Questionnaires at 1, 3, and 6 months and an overnight infrared video in the home at 1 month were completed. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat and an ""as-used"" analysis of questionnaires showed no group differences at 1, 3, and 6 months in infant-adult direct bed-sharing (7% vs 12%, P = .24 at 1 month), and at the 6-month interview, the wahakura group reported twice the level of full breastfeeding (22.5% vs 10.7%, P = .04). Maternal sleep and fatigue were not significantly different between groups. Video identified no increase in head covering, prone/side sleep position, or bed-sharing in the wahakura group, either from intention-to-treat analysis, or when analyzed for actual sleep location. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in infant risk behaviors in wahakura compared with bassinets and there were other advantages, including an increase in sustained breastfeeding. This suggests wahakura are relatively safe and can be promoted as an alternative to infant-adult bed-sharing. Policies that encourage utilization are likely to be helpful in high-risk populations.","2017-02","2019-02-14 12:41:56","2019-02-14 12:41:56","","57-57","","2","139","","Pediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Questionnaires; Sudden Infant Death -- Prevention and Control; Sudden Infant Death -- Risk Factors; Infant; Human; New Zealand; Random Assignment; Randomized Controlled Trials; Sleep -- In Infancy and Childhood; Infant Equipment; Cribs; Maori","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer diagnoses, which were once thought universally fatal, now often entail management of a chronic disease. Yet the therapies are rigorous, must start immediately, and in many cases result in premature failure of the body's reproductive ability. In women, this loss is especially poignant; unlike the routine storage of sperm, which is done in men and boys facing similar treatment decisions, freezing oocytes in anticipation of fertility loss is not possible in most cases, and creating an embryo within days of diagnosis raises significant moral, social and medical challenges. Oncofertility is the study of how to harvest ovarian tissue in women facing cancer to preserve their gametes for future use with IVF, thus allowing the decisions about childbearing to be deferred and reproductive choices to be preserved. The research endeavor uses the capacity of the ovarian follicle to produce eggs in vitro. Developing the human follicle to ovulate successfully outside the body is scientifically difficult and ethically challenging. Infertility is linked to long-standing religious and moral traditions, and is intertwined with deeply contentious social narratives about women, families, illness and birth. Is the research morally permissible? Perhaps imperative if understood as a repair from iatrogenic harms? How are considerations of justice central to the work? How will vulnerable subjects be protected? What are the moral implications of the work for women, children and families? What are the implications for society if women could store ovarian tissue as a way of stopping the biological clock? What are the moral possibilities and challenges if eggs can be produced in large quantities from a stored ovarian tissue?","2008-06","2019-02-14 12:41:56","2019-02-14 12:41:56","","21-29","","6","8","","American Journal of Bioethics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Child; Adult; Ovary -- Drug Effects; Parents; Animal Studies; Mice; Consent; Neoplasms -- Therapy; Cancer Survivors; Christianity; Cryopreservation -- Ethical Issues; Decision Making, Family; Ethics, Medical; Fertilization in Vitro -- Ethical Issues; Infertility -- Prevention and Control; Nanotechnology; Ovary; Ovum; Reproductive Health -- Ethical Issues; Research Ethics; Social Justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 455 healthy pregnant women of all gestational ages receiving antenatal care from an independent midwife in the Netherlands. Weight gain was assessed using the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and classified as below, within, or above the guidelines. A multinomial regression analysis was performed with weight gain classifications as the dependent variable (within IOM-guidelines as reference). Independent variables were pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet (broken down into consumption of vegetables, fruit and fish) and physical activity (motivation to engage in physical activity, pre-pregnancy physical activity and decline in physical activity during pregnancy). Covariates were age, gestational age, parity, ethnicity, family income, education, perceived sleep deprivation, satisfaction with pre-pregnancy weight, estimated prepregnancy body mass index, smoking, having a weight gain goal and having received weight gain advice from the midwife. Findings: forty-two per cent of the women surveyed gained weight within the guidelines. Fourteen per cent of the women gained weight below the guidelines and 44 per cent gained weight above the guidelines. Weight gain within the guidelines, compared to both above and below the guidelines, was not associated with pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index nor with diet. A decline in physical activity was associated with weight gain above the guidelines (OR 0.54, 95 per cent CI 0.33-0.89). Weight gain below the guidelines was seen more often in women who perceived a greater sleep deprivation (OR 1.20, 95 per cent CI 1.02-1.41). Weight gain above the guidelines was seen less often in Caucasian women in comparison to non-Caucasian women (OR 0.22, 95 per cent CI 0.08-0.56) and with women who did not stop smoking during pregnancy (OR 0.49, 95 per cent CI 0.25-0.95). Key conclusions and implications for practice: a decline in physical activity was the only modifiable factor in our population associated with weight gain above the gain recommended by the guidelines. Prevention of reduced physical activity during pregnancy seems a promising approach to promoting healthy weight gain. Interventions to promote healthy weight gain should focus on all women, regardless of pre-pregnancy body mass index.","2015-07","2019-02-14 12:42:00","2019-02-14 12:42:00","","693-701","","7","31","","Midwifery","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Interviews; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Body Mass Index; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Adult; Human; Physical Activity; Diet; Funding Source; Confidence Intervals; Prenatal Care; Gestational Age; Exploratory Research; Netherlands; Prepregnancy Care; Motivation; Weight Gain -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much less is known about cumulative trauma (CT) exposure especially in African-American women. Women exposed to several types of trauma including childhood abuse, discrimination, or witnessed family violence may develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress or have difficulty sleeping.The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among cumulative trauma, posttraumatic stress, sleep, and perinatal outcomes. A sample of 150 essentially healthy African-American women who had given birth were recruited at Hutzel Women's Hospital and St. John Providence Hospital Southfield, and asked to complete the Cumulative Trauma Scale, Community Safety Questionnaire, Conflict Tactics Scale, Clinician-administered PTSD Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Edinburgh Depression Inventory, and Demographic Data Form. The prenatal and hospital medical records were reviewed for multiple maternal and neonatal outcomes. Regression analysis was used to determine if relationships between the variables exist, and the strength of those relationships.The findings of this study showed: 1) African- American women experience traumatic events. 2) cumulative trauma is associated with PTSD, depression, poor sleep quality, and neonatal outcomes; 3) nursing must go beyond the assessment of intimate partner violence, report active trauma, and record findings in the medical record; and 4) more research is needed to better understand mothers' use of over the counter and other medications to help them sleep. The relevance to maternal child health is that a better understanding of cumulative trauma exposure, PTSD, poor sleep, and the risk for poor perinatal outcomes among African-American women can lead to earlier identification and the development of nursing interventions.","2015-01","2019-02-14 12:42:03","2019-02-14 12:42:03","","","143 p","","","","","","","","","","Wayne State University","","","","","c8h","UMI Order AAI3700626","EBSCOhost","","Ph.D.","","","","Female; Questionnaires; Pregnancy Outcomes; Human; Depression; Scales; Record Review; Regression; Mothers -- Psychosocial Factors; Blacks; Michigan; Sleep -- Psychosocial Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose and Background/Significance: The main purpose of the study is to determine: (1) to determine if there is a relationship between vitamin D status, pregnancy symptoms, health promoting behaviors, and quality of life and (2) to determine if differences exist in pregnancy symptoms, health promoting behaviors and quality of life between African American and Hispanic women. There is evidence to show that vitamin D deficiency has been associated with numerous symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, poor sleep, and depression. However, whether low levels of vitamin D is associated with these and other symptoms during pregnancy is unknown. What is known is that vitamin D deficiency disproportionately affects pregnant minority women, therefore, this study will help to understand the impact that vitamin D deficiency has on pregnancy symptoms and potential impact on quality of life. Theoretical/ conceptual framework: Using Wilson & Cleary's Health Related Quality of Life model, that the characteristics of the individual (e.g. age, ethnicity) and the environment (e.g. social support) has an important impact on biological factors (e.g. vitamin D status), symptom status (pregnancy symptoms and depression), functional status (health promoting behaviors), all of which ultimately effect the overall health related quality of life. Method: A descriptive, cross sectional design examining women at 24 to 32 weeks gestation. The variables of study include the following: biologic (vitamin D status), symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Pregnancy Symptom Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), functional status (Health Promoting Lifestyles Profilev.2), and quality of life (SF-12). A convenience sample of 125 women from an underserved, low income health center serving a predominantly African American and Hispanic patient population will be recruited. Results: With vitamin D measured on a binary scale as sufficient (vitamin D level >30 ng/ml) versus deficient (vitamin D level <30 ng/ml), both univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models will be used to assess the association between these risk factors and vitamin D status. As a measure of effect size, univariable odds ratios along with their 95% confidence intervals will be reported, and a single multivariable model will report adjusted odds ratios for each factor after controlling for the influence of other significant predictors of vitamin D deficiency.","2017-01","2019-02-14 12:42:05","2019-02-14 12:42:05","","1-1","","P.H.D.","","","What is the Relationship Between Vitamin D Status, Pregnancy Symptoms & Quality of Life?","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","10239880","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Logistic Regression; Questionnaires; Human; Young Adult; Convenience Sample; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Scales; Confidence Intervals; Quality of Life; Vitamin D -- Administration and Dosage -- In Pregnancy; Vitamin D -- Pharmacodynamics; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Complications -- In Pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women. Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression. Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable. The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guide-lines limiting the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and, as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents.","2004-11-02","2019-02-14 12:42:09","2019-02-14 12:42:09","","S6-2","","","6","","Clinical Cornerstone","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Adult; Middle Age; Research Instruments; Insomnia -- Epidemiology; Insomnia -- Diagnosis; Insomnia -- Drug Therapy; Insomnia -- Therapy; Women's Health; Education, Continuing (Credit); Antidepressive Agents -- Therapeutic Use; Insomnia; Patient History Taking; Antianxiety Agents, Benzodiazepine -- Therapeutic Use; Hormone Replacement Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A sample of 105 post-partum women was recruited. All participants answered a questionnaire; women who experienced LBP during pregnancy (n=71) continue in the study and later they were also interviewed. Content analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Reports of LBP were common (n=71; 67.6%) and slightly more frequent in primiparous (n=40; 56.3%) than multiparous (n=31; 43.7%) women. Multiparous women with LBP were significantly older (p< 0.001) and reported more sleep disturbances (p=0.026) than primiparous women with LBP. LBP prevented women performing their daily activities (n=41; 57.7%) and worsened with the advance of pregnancy (n=55; 77.5%), yet 93.0% (n=66) of these women received no treatment.

For the past 4 decades, treatment of insomnia has shifted away from the use of barbiturates toward the use of hypnotic agents of the benzodiazepine class. However, problems associated with the latter (eg, next-day sedation, rebound insomnia, dependence, and tolerance) have prompted development of other agents. OBJECTIVE: This review describes the recently approved nonbenzodiazepine agent, zaleplon. METHODS: Studies of zaleplon were identified through a search of English-language articles listed in MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, with no limitation on year. These were supplemented by educational materials from conferences. RESULTS: The efficacy and tolerability of zaleplon have been documented in the literature. Zaleplon has been shown to improve sleep variables in comparison with placebo. Like most hypnotic agents, zaleplon can be used for problems of sleep initiation at the beginning of the night, but its short duration of clinical effect may also allow patients to take it later in the night without residual effects the next morning. Zaleplon can be taken < or = 2 hours before awakening without 'hangover' effects. It is generally well tolerated, with headache being the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials (15%-18%). Compared with flurazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, zaleplon causes significantly less psychomotor and cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). Zaleplon has not been studied in pregnant women or children. The dose of zaleplon should be individualized; the recommended daily dose for most adults is 10 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia has a substantial impact on daily functioning. If pharmacologic treatment is indicated for insomnia, the choice of an agent should be guided by individual patient characteristics.","2000-11","2019-02-14 12:42:20","2019-02-14 12:42:20","","1254-1267","","11","22","","Clinical Therapeutics","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Clinical Trials; Drug Interactions; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- Adverse Effects; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- Therapeutic Use; Insomnia -- Drug Therapy; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- Administration and Dosage; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- Contraindications; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- Pharmacodynamics; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- Pharmacokinetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Material and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted and the study population consisted of 100 women from mid to late-term gestation (second and third trimester of pregnancy). Data were collected by means of an anonymous questionnaire that was completed voluntarily by the participants. Results: A statistically significant correlation was found between the depression during pregnancy score and the sleep quality score (p<0.001). Among the participants, 25% pregnant women in the study were found to be suffering from depression, while 93% reported that they had insufficient sleep during the last month. According to multivariate analysis, pregnant women with a higher level of education, being in a relationship, being employed and having moderate support from their family environment had lower depression score while older women had lower sleep quality score. Conclusions: The observation of high rate of depressive symptoms during pregnancy and its effect on the sleep habits of pregnant women confirms the necessity of early diagnosis and preventive actions.","2018-10","2019-02-14 12:42:21","2019-02-14 12:42:21","","314-332","","4","17","","Rostrum of Asclepius / Vima tou Asklipiou","","","","","","","","","","","c8h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","Female; Pregnancy; Cross Sectional Studies; Questionnaires; Human; Marital Status; Self Report; Educational Status; Depression -- In Pregnancy; Support, Psychosocial; Employment Status; Multivariate Analysis; Sleep Deprivation; Sleep -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
